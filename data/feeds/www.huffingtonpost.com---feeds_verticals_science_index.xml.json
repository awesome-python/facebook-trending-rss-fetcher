The company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/kind-docs/citizen-petition.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">issued a citizen petition</a> signed by 12 high-profile nutritionists in December, asking the FDA to update its requirements for packaging a food as \"healthy.\"&nbsp;Kind claimed the standards for using the term are based on outdated nutrition science concerning saturated fat, in which nuts are high.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>After a back-and-forth battle between the snack company and government agency,&nbsp;the FDA has not backed down on the saturated fat issue. It will, however, allow the company to use the phrase&nbsp;&ldquo;healthy and tasty&rdquo; on its packaging, but only in text related to Kind's&nbsp;\"corporate philosophy.\" <strong>The FDA specifically noted that the word \"healthy\" should not appear on the same panel as its nutrition content claims or information.&nbsp;</strong></p><br />\n<p>The news does come in conjunction with a larger announcement that the FDA will reevaluate its nutrition labeling regulations more generally, including use of the term \"healthy.\"</p><br />\n<p>The FDA plans to crowdsource opinions from nutrition experts, as well as from the public, about what the new definition of healthy foods should be. The current definition&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064908.htm#health\" target=\"_blank\">applies the term \"healthy\" to foods that meet the dietary recommendations</a> for total fat, saturated fat, sodium, cholesterol and beneficial nutrients such as calcium.</p><br />\n<p>Nutrition experts largely agree that the agency's labeling guidelines, which were <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ucm063102.htm\" target=\"_blank\">developed in 1993</a> and haven't changed much since, are long overdue for an update to keep them in step with current nutrition science. <strong>The guideline for saturated fat in particular, critics including Kind say, is leftover from the 90s, when low-fat diets were in favor (we now know plant-based fats are part of a healthy diet).&nbsp;</strong></p><br />\n<p>The most recent federal dietary guidelines recommend that Americans consume healthy fats from foods like fish, nuts, seeds, olive oil and avocados. This isn't to say that Kind bars deserve the healthy label, but if they don't deserve it, it shouldn't be because they contain high-fat nuts such as almonds.</p><br />\n<p>Still, the FDA will face a steep challenge in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/business/15food.html\" target=\"_blank\">keeping corporate food interests from manipulating the yet-to-be-defined terms</a>&nbsp;they want to use to market their products.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<h4>The larger implications of a labeling overhaul</h4><br />\n<p>Americans are more interested in buying health foods, whatever that means, now than ever. And they've gotten the message on the latest research: Low-fat food sales are slipping and <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-seeks-to-redefine-healthy-1462872601\" target=\"_blank\">Americans are buying more gluten-free and all-natural products</a>, according to The Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Of course, there's not much indication that the latest healthful-seeming labels are any better than those that have fallen out of fashion.</p><br />\n<p>\"<a href=\"http://www.foodpolitics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The terms 'healthy' and 'natural' help to sell food products</a>.&nbsp;They are about marketing, not health,\" wrote Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University, Thursday on her blog Food Politics.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Nestle called the FDA's task unenviable. \"I am opposed in principle to health claims on foods,\" she told The Huffington Post.</p><br />\n<p>But if the task of defining \"healthy\" foods were forced upon her, however, \"I&rsquo;d say as minimally processed as possible, with added salt and sugar in minimal amounts,\" she said, noting that the salt and sugar cut points would have to be defined and very low.</p><br />\n<p>James DiNicolantonio, a cardiovascular research scientist at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute, seemed to agree.&nbsp;Most healthy foods don't have a food label, DiNicolantonio explained, pointing out that true healthful foods like fruits, vegetable, fish and lean meats are found in nature rather than factories and come without a package full of claims.</p><br />\n<p>\"Taking this into account, it then becomes somewhat apparent that labeling foods as being healthy is defeating the purpose,\" he said.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>According to DiNicolantonio, labeling distracts from the fact that we're probably better off eating foods that don't require labels in the first place.</p><br />\n<p>\"That being said,\" he added, \"I think calling out hidden added sugars is an undoubted step in the right direction, with the caveat that there is a lot of work that needs to be done from there.\"</p><br />\n<h4>The sad reality is that we probably need 'healthy' food labels</h4><br />\n<p>Given expert opinions, wouldn't it be simpler to make the term \"healthy\" off-limits to to packaged food products?</p><br />\n<p>Yes, but it's probably unrealistic to expect Americans to eschew processed foods altogether, all the time.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>If you're stuck in a situation where processed foods are the only thing available to you (read: the airport), <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kind-bar-misleading-label-petition_us_565c8276e4b079b2818af769\">it can be helpful to know which foods are on the healthier end of the spectrum</a>,&nbsp;Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told HuffPost in December.&nbsp;(Willett authored a letter of support for food policy changes last year, but doesn't have any affiliation with Kind.)</p><br />\n<p>As for the company at the center of the action,&nbsp;Kind CEO Daniel Lubetzky acknowledged the difficultly the FDA faces in creating a blanket definition for healthy foods.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>\"Nutritionists and the scientific community come up with something that seems very sound, and then the industry gets in the middle and you end up with special interests influencing public policy,\"&nbsp;Lubetzky said.&nbsp;\"The media and groups like the Center for Science in the Public Interest and consumers and nutritions need to hold the industry accountable for any abuses and to call them out.\"</p><br />\n<p>It could take years, including rounds proposals and hearings, before the FDA can implement an update to its definition of \"healthy.\" But for now, the announcement is a step in the right direction, particularly if the new requirements help reign in the nation's added sugar and sodium habits.&nbsp;</p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/565cb2d71700004b00e1abc3.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/this-shark-with-a-big-mouth-will-creep-you-out_n_9938438.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[This Shark With A Big Mouth Will Creep You Out]]></title>\n      <author>Ron Dicker</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/this-shark-with-a-big-mouth-will-creep-you-out_n_9938438.html?utm_hp_ref=science&amp;ir=Science</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:58:57 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\"><br />\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><div id=\"vidible_14630867411\" class=\"vdb_player vdb_5668ae6ee4b0b5e26955d6a656000e19e4b0e4e194b84b31\" vdb_params=\"m.fwkeyvalues=sponsorship%3DSPONSORSHIP_NAME&amp;m.fwsitesection=composer\"><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=5668ae6ee4b0b5e26955d6a6/vid=57339699e4b0ec4e30ce0934/56000e19e4b0e4e194b84b31.js\"></script></div></div><script type='text/javascript'>function onPlayerReadyVidible(e){'undefined'!=typeof HPTrack&&HPTrack.Vid.Vidible_track(e)}!function(e,i){if(e.vdb_Player){if('object'==typeof commercial_video){var a='',o='m.fwsitesection='+commercial_video.site_and_category;if(a+=o,commercial_video['package']){var c='&m.fwkeyvalues=sponsorship%3D'+commercial_video['package'];a+=c}e.setAttribute('vdb_params',a)}i(e.vdb_Player)}else{var t=arguments.callee;setTimeout(function(){t(e,i)},0)}}(document.getElementById('vidible_1'),onPlayerReadyVidible);</script></div><br />\n     <br />\n<p>The basking shark has a whole lot of mouth but not a lot of bite.</p><br />\n<p>The shark can grow more than 40 feet long and weigh 5 tons, making it the second largest fish, according to the HuffPost Originals video above.</p><br />\n<p>It's un-\"Jaws\"-like diet might come as a surprise to some.

By making students stay home, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/student-suspension-maps_us_55afb813e4b0a9b948532e18\">school suspensions -- which disproportionately impact students of color</a> -- sometimes push kids out of school and into the criminal justice system.</p><br />\n<p>But there are easy ways for teachers to reduce their reliance on this punishment. A few researchers from Stanford University found that when teachers are reminded to approach students with an empathic mindset, <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2016/04/26/teacher-empathy-reduces-student-suspensions-stanford-research-shows/\" target=\"_blank\">rates of school suspensions go down</a>.</p><br />\n<p>\"We didn&rsquo;t tell teachers to not suspend students or do something when a child misbehaves. We refocused their mindset and they were led to do things they already knew would be better,\" said Jason Okonofua,&nbsp;Stanford psychology postdoctoral fellow and study researcher.</p><br />\n<p>The study defines an empathic mindset as one in which &ldquo;good teacher&ndash;student relationships are critical for students to learn self-control.&rdquo; This is compared to a punitive mindset, in which teachers view punishment as an essential element of controlling a classroom.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>The study involved three different experiments. The first experiment involved asking one group of teachers to read an article about the empathic mindset while the other read an article about the punitive mindset. Next, all teachers read about incidents of student misbehavior and were asked to describe how they would respond. Teachers who read about the empathic mindset punished students less harshly and were less likely to label the child a troublemaker.</p><br />\n<p>In the second experiment, a group of college students were asked to imagine themselves as middle school students who had misbehaved. Their imagined teacher responded to this misbehavior in either the punitive mindset or empathic mindset. Students were subsequently asked how much they respected their fictional teacher and whether that impacted their motivation to behave well in the future. The responses favored teachers who had acted with an empathic mindset.</p><br />\n<p>Researchers also went into five diverse middle schools in California and asked 31 math teachers to participate in 45-minute and 25-minute online exercises. During the exercises, some teachers read articles that emphasized the empathic mindset. The simple activity substantially reduced the suspension rates of their students.</p><br />\n<p>The study looked at 1,682 of the teachers' students. Around 5 percent of students whose teachers read about the empathic mindset were suspended that school year. By comparison, about 10 percent of students whose teachers did a control exercise were suspended. The study shows how one teacher's behavior could change a child's entire year.</p><br />\n<p>\"By having just one teacher who is more empathic towards them, students are less likely to be suspended by any teacher in any part of the school,\" said<span class=\"gD\">&nbsp;Okonofua. \"We tweaked one part of the school day for the children and that changed their entire social world there and how they felt about school-at-large.\"</span></p><br />\n<p>The intervention is easily replicable, according to Okonofua. The online exercise is cheap, he said, and teachers can do it on their own time.</p><br />\n<p>\"This is just a matter of a teacher on their own accord signing in and doing it,\" he said.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Jahana Hayes, a Connecticut educator who was recently named the National Teacher of the Year, thinks teachers should also&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jahana-hayes-teacher-of-the-year_us_572262cfe4b01a5ebde50281\">teach empathy to students</a>.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;We spend a lot of time teaching kids to be self-sufficient and high achievers, and I think we really need to spend some time also teaching them: OK, now what do you do with that? What does it mean? You have this knowledge and information, how can you use it to improve the human condition?&rdquo; Hayes said. &ldquo;I think we need to nurture empathy from a very early age.&rdquo;</p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/5734cb0d22000042072566f3.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/11/brazil-should-not-host-the-olympic-games-argues-expert_n_9937692.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Brazil Should Not Host The Olympic Games, Public Health Expert Warns]]></title>\n      <author>Anna Almendrala</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/11/brazil-should-not-host-the-olympic-games-argues-expert_n_9937692.html?utm_hp_ref=science&amp;ir=Science</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:13:03 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<br />\n<p>Because <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/brazil/\">Brazil</a> is at the heart of the current <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/zika/\">Zika virus</a> epidemic, the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/2016-summer-olympics/\">2016 Summer Olympics</a> in Rio de Janiero should be postponed or moved to a new location,&nbsp;a leading expert in population health and global development argues in the <a href=\"http://harvardpublichealthreview.org/off-the-podium-why-rios-2016-olympic-games-must-not-proceed/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Public Health Review</a>.</p><br />\n<p>The Olympics draws hundreds of thousands of spectators from all over the world, writes Amir Attaran, a professor of law and medicine at the University of Ottawa, adding that this will only serve to create new routes for the disease to migrate to other countries.</p><br />\n<p>Attaran's call to action is all the more urgent considering the fact that scientists believe the Zika outbreak in Brazil began with another global sporting event -- either the FIFA World Cup or the Va&rsquo;a World Sprint Championship canoe races, both of which took place in 2014.</p><br />\n<p>While the disease is normally mosquito-borne, there is new evidence that it can also spread through sexual contact and from mother to fetus, causing a longer period of infectiousness and making it easier to spread when foreign nationals return to their home counties.</p><br />\n<p>And though scientists are learning more about how the virus can cause severe brain damage in newborns and potentially fatal neurological disorders in adults, Attaran says accelerating the disease's spread on a global scale would erase any gains researchers have made in trying to understand the virus -- and how to stop it.</p><br />\n<p>If the Olympic games weren&rsquo;t already scheduled, he asks, would any country grappling with a serious infectious disease outbreak invite hundreds of thousands of international travelers to visit?&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>\"Mass migration into the heart of an outbreak is a public health no-brainer,&rdquo; he writes. \"And given the choice between accelerating a dangerous new disease or not -- for it is impossible that Games will slow Zika down -- the answer should be a no-brainer for the Olympic organizers too. Putting sentimentality aside, clearly the Rio 2016 Games must not proceed.\"</p><br />\n<p>For the record, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises pregnant women to <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/s0226-summer-olympic-games.html\" target=\"_blank\">consider not attending the Olympics</a>. If they must attend, women should talk to their doctors first and take strict steps to avoid mosquito bites.&nbsp;The U.S. Olympic Committee <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-usa-olympics-exlusive-idUSKCN0VH0BJ\" target=\"_blank\">advised athletes back in February</a> that they shouldn't go to Brazil if they feel scared about Zika virus,&nbsp;and one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/09/kenya-rio-2016-olympics-zika-virus\" target=\"_blank\">Kenyan official threatened to pull</a>&nbsp;his country's athletes if the outbreak worsens.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<h4>Attaran points the finger at the World Health Organization</h4><br />\n<p>Attaran reserves his most pointed criticism in his op-ed for the World Health Organization, which to date stands by the International Olympic Committee&rsquo;s January statement that <a href=\"http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/IOC_Statement_on_Zika-eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">it is safe for Rio de Janeiro</a> to host the international games. The WHO has pointed to the Brazilian government&rsquo;s efforts to eradicate mosquitoes, and to the fact that the games will be held during Brazil's winter season, when there are fewer mosquitoes.</p><br />\n<p>But as rates of other mosquito-borne viruses in the country continue to rise as the games approach,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s becoming less clear if the Brazilian government has control over the epidemic -- or that colder months are having the desired effect of killing mosquito populations, Attaran points out.</p><br />\n<p>\"WHO&rsquo;s hesitancy is reminiscent of <a href=\"Just over 50 percent of tickets to the upcoming Games had been purchased by THE END OF? THE BEGINNING OF? April, a rate much slower than sales for the last summer Olympics in London.\" target=\"_blank\">its mistakes with Ebola</a>, all over again,\" Attaran wrote.</p><br />\n<p>WHO officials did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment. But Attaran brings up a good point about how international sporting events can transmit new diseases to populations with no previous immunity but with receptive vectors (in this case, the <em>Aedes Aegypti</em> mosquito) that are capable of spreading it further. After all, scientists suspect that&rsquo;s how Zika virus got to Brazil in the first place.</p><br />\n<p>No one knows for sure how or when Zika virus entered Brazil, but as mentioned above, experts suspect that an infected international visitor may have spread the virus to the country&rsquo;s local mosquito population during either the World Cup, which took place in June and July, or the canoe races, held in August.</p><br />\n<p>No countries with ongoing Zika virus epidemics competed in the World Cup, while <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4593458/\" target=\"_blank\">four Pacific Island countries</a>&nbsp;that did have ongoing Zika virus outbreaks competed in the canoe races, notes Didier Musso of the Institut Louis Malard&eacute; in Tahiti. This, along with phylogenetic studies that link the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4501423/\" target=\"_blank\">virus in Brazil to an Asian strain</a> also found in those Pacific Island countries, suggests that Zika most likely arrived in Brazil during the canoe race event.</p><br />\n<h4>Despite its rapid spread, we're lucky Zika virus hasn't broken out in a new region of the world</h4><br />\n<p>Because both mosquitoes and people can travel, 57 countries and territories have reported local Zika virus spread in the past year. Most of them are in Latin America and the Caribbean, however, and the WHO itself notes in <a href=\"http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/articles/one-year-outbreak/en/index2.html\" target=\"_blank\">its review of the current epidemic</a>&nbsp;that it&rsquo;s only a \"matter of luck\" that infected Brazilians traveling to other countries haven't yet sparked a fresh epidemic in a new part of the globe:</p><br />\n<blockquote><br />\n<p>The outbreak in Brazil also carried a high risk of exported cases, with around 10 million travellers departing each year for international destinations. Although several hundred imported cases have been reported worldwide, none is known to have sparked an outbreak. This is likely more a matter of luck than evidence of little potential for spread, as most cases were exported to countries during a season of no or low mosquito activity.</p><br />\n</blockquote><br />\n<p>It's unclear if or when the International Olympic Committee will take Attaran's advice to heart; Attaran notes that committee members' past statements on Zika have ranged from denial to mockery. But it seems as if the rest of the world is already getting the message: Just <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/04/11/473828835/amid-brazils-recession-ticket-sales-lag-for-rio-olympics\" target=\"_blank\">over 50 percent of tickets</a>&nbsp;to the upcoming Games had been purchased by the beginning of April, a rate much slower than sales for the last summer Olympics in London.&nbsp;</p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/573381a52200005707256547.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-j-ferguson/when-media-scholars-and-a_b_9917496.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[When Media Scholars and Anti-Media Advocacy Groups Get Too Close]]></title>\n      <author>Christopher J.

These are the boxes that appear at the beginning of a show, typically showing age categories such as TV-14 with content descriptors such as S for sex or V for violence.  <br />\n<br />\nIn the last few weeks the Parents Television Council (PTC), a controversial and aggressive anti-media advocacy group, has been pushing the Federal Communications Commission and congress to hold hearings on revamping the TV ratings.  The PTC appears to be allied mainly with <a href=\"http://w2.parentstv.org/blog/index.php/2016/05/09/coalition-calls-on-fcc-to-reform-tv-ratings/\" target=\"_hplink\">right-wing religious </a>or social conservative groups in its effort, expressing concern that the current TV ratings allow for too much objectionable content.  Echoing this concern, a group of <a href=\"http://w2.parentstv.org/blog/index.php/2016/04/28/leading-researchers-message-to-congress-fcc/\" target=\"_hplink\">28 scholars</a> wrote to the FCC last week to support hearings claiming that objectionable content could be harmful to minors.  In order to suggest that they were not affiliated with any other organization, the authors of the letter explicitly noted that they were \"writing as independent private citizens. . .\"   However, one <a href=\"http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/academics-fcc-ratings-revamp-must-be-balanced/156309\" target=\"_hplink\">recent news report </a>has discovered that this statement may have been written at the request of the PTC.  So it isn't too surprising to learn that the statement goes on to claim that research has \". . . documented harmful effects of violent content; indeed, this is by far the most thoroughly researched area of media effects.\"<br />\n <br />\nYet, these claims are patently false.  There certainly are numerous studies of media effects, but whether considering violent content or other objectionable content, the evidence has always been <a href=\"http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/35/6/772.full.pdf+html\" target=\"_hplink\">inconsistent</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15506878jobem4802_3\" target=\"_hplink\">controversial</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20677858\" target=\"_hplink\">often plagued </a>by methodological flaws.  In their letter to the FCC the 28 academics engage in a dubious practice called citation bias...citing only studies supporting their personal views, and ignoring studies that inconveniently do not.  In one recent essay, scholars Thomas Babor and Thomas McGovern specifically refer to this unscientific behavior as one of the \"<a href=\"http://www.parint.org/isajewebsite/bookimages/isaje_2nd_edition_chapter11.pdf\" target=\"_hplink\">seven deadly sins</a>\" of scientific publishing.  Reports of close coordination with a censorious anti-media advocacy group are also worrisome.  In a <a href=\"http://christopherjferguson.com/SCOTUSPaper.pdf\" target=\"_hplink\">report from 2013</a>, I warned scholars against such activities, noting these represented a conflict-of-interest similar to working closely with media industries.    <br />\n<br />\nConcerned about this misrepresentation of the research field by some academics, a second group of <a href=\"http://interpersonalresearch.weebly.com/letter-to-the-fcc.html\" target=\"_hplink\">over 60 scholars </a>has also written to the FCC, noting that the research data cannot support claims of harm or consistent effects.  This second letter expresses remorse that some of their scientific colleagues would misrepresent the data in apparent support of a moral advocacy agenda.<br />\n<br />\nUnfortunately, the distinction between good science and moral advocacy has long been a problem for media effects.  Back in 2011, the US Supreme Court weighed in for the <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/08-1448.pdf\" target=\"_hplink\">Brown v EMA </a>case which considered the regulation of violent video game sales to minors.  The majority decision correctly noted that research evidence was inconsistent and could not be used to make claims of a public health crisis.  Many of the same scholars who pushed unsuccessfully for the regulation of violent games 5 years ago are now back arguing for the same for television. <br />\n<br />\nWhy is this issue of TV ratings coming up now?  Groups such as the PTC thrive off of generating controversy regarding media.  The PTC is perhaps most famous for raising a national brouhaha over Janet Jackson's \"wardrobe malfunction\" at the <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/hlef4hb\" target=\"_hplink\">2004 Super Bowl </a>half-time show.  Media regulation/censorship focused advocacy groups arguably survive by the donations solicited through frightening people and whipping up outrage (the PTC has <a href=\"http://w2.parentstv.org/main/SupportUs/howtohelp.aspx\" target=\"_hplink\">helpful suggestions </a>on their website about how to donate to them in your will, or give them a car or stocks).  The result is that the general public and policymakers are fed frightening misinformation rather than an accurate and careful tally of divergent research data.  That some scholars participated in this process is distressing to see.  However, it may be representative of larger problems within psychological science, which is fully in the depths of a<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/psychologys-replication-crisis-cant-be-wished-away/472272/\" target=\"_hplink\"> replication crisis</a>, wherein many things we once thought were true are proving difficult to replicate with a closer look.  Media effects is one of the areas being hard hit by this phenomenon.<br />\n<br />\nThe bottom line is that, if the goal is to provide good quality information to parents, hearings prompted by moral advocacy and dishonest claims on the part of some scholars are unlikely to provide this.  Ratings that resulted from this process would undoubtedly do more to misinform than inform viewers.  We deserve better than the scaremongering that so often dominates conversations about media. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4235740/images/s-COUPLE-WATCHING-TELEVISION-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/11/mom-celebrates-rainbow-baby-with-ivf-themed-pregnancy-announcement_n_9934424.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Mom Celebrates Rainbow Baby With IVF-Themed Pregnancy Announcement]]></title>\n      <author>Caroline Bologna</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/11/mom-celebrates-rainbow-baby-with-ivf-themed-pregnancy-announcement_n_9934424.html?utm_hp_ref=science&amp;ir=Science</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:55:35 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<p>When Macy Rodeffer learned that she was pregnant, she decided to announce the news with a photo that acknowledged her long journey with IVF.</p><br />\n<p>The mom-to-be <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BEG5rcLkg7M/\" target=\"_blank\">posted an Instagram photo</a> of her IVF medication in the shape of a heart around an ultrasound photo and onesie that says \"Worth the Wait and Wait and Wait.\"</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>\"I knew that my announcement would hurt women still waiting for their baby, because I've been there before myself,\" Rodeffer told The Huffington Post.&nbsp;\"It was important to me that my announcement not only convey my joy, but also share my struggle and encourage women not to give up.\"</p><br />\n<p>\"While I don't expect everyone to share their infertility struggle (as it's a deeply private thing), I felt passionate about being an advocate for women with infertility and pregnancy loss,\" she added.</p><br />\n<p>Rodeffer and her husband Tyler spent almost four years trying to conceive -- a painful time that involved three miscarriages, a diagnosis of male factor infertility and severe endometriosis and surgery to remove a large ovarian cyst.</p><br />\n<p>After a January IVF cycle, Rodeffer learned she was pregnant with her <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/viral-rainbow-babies-photo-post-brings-emotional-topic-to-light_us_560303f0e4b0fde8b0d109bc\">rainbow baby</a>, a boy due in October.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>For the pregnancy announcement,&nbsp;she drew <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baby-syringes-photo-goes-viral-fertility-struggles_us_561806fce4b0dbb8000e7a59\">inspiration from a viral photo of an infant</a> surrounded by her mom's IVF medication.&nbsp;\"The moment I saw that photo I knew that I wanted to do something that included all of my medicines, too,\" Rodeffer told HuffPost.</p><br />\n<p>The mom-to-be wants her photo to inspire others as well. \"It is my hope that men and women find encouragement to never give up on their dreams,\" she said.</p><br />\n<p>\"There are those who do understand exactly what they are going through,\" she continued. \"And we're here to support them through their journey.

The participants were randomly assigned to complete either a three-month course in yoga and meditation, or to practice memory-training exercises, consisting of skills and tricks already known to boost memory.</p><br />\n<p>At the end of the study, the two groups saw similar improvements in their verbal memory, which is the type of memory used when people remember names or lists of words. But those who practiced yoga had bigger improvements in visual-spatial memory, the type of memory used to recall locations and navigate while driving.</p><br />\n<p>The yoga group also saw bigger reductions in their symptoms of <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/34718-depression-treatment-psychotherapy-anti-depressants.html\">depression</a> and anxiety than did the brain-training group.</p><br />\n<p>\"Historically and anecdotally, yoga has been thought to be beneficial in aging well, but this is the scientific demonstration of that benefit,\" study co-author Harris Eyre, a doctoral candidate at Australia's University of Adelaide,<a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2016-05/uoc--trr050416.php\">said in a statement</a>. \"We're converting historical wisdom into the high level of evidence required for doctors to recommend therapy to their patients,\" said Eyre, who conducted the study with researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>The yoga training involved a weekly class in Kundalini yoga, which involves breathing exercises, chanting, meditation, hand movements and visualization of light. Participants in this group were also told to practice a chanting mediation called Kirtan Kriya at home for 20 minutes each day.</p><br />\n<p>The group that did the memory-training exercises participated in weekly sessions to learn skills to boost their memory, such as learning how to associate certain images or words with people's faces and names to remember them better.</p><br />\n<p>Both groups also showed changes in their brain activity that reflected improvements in memory, the researchers said.</p><br />\n<p>The type of yoga practiced in the study may improve memory because it involves chanting and visualizations, which may strengthen certain verbal and visual skills, and also improve overall awareness and attention, the researchers said. It's also thought that <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/42204-what-is-yoga.html\">practicing yoga</a> may increase the production of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor, which stimulates the growth of connections among neurons, the researchers said.</p><br />\n<p>However, because the new study was small, more research is needed in larger groups of people to confirm the findings, the researchers said.</p><br />\n<p><em>Follow Rachael Rettner </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RachaelRettner\"><em>@RachaelRettner</em></a>. <em>Follow</em><em>Live Science </em><a title=\"https://twitter/livescience\" href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveScience\"><em>@livescience</em></a><em>, </em><em><a title=\"http://www.facebook.com/#!/livescience\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/#!/livescience\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;</em><em>&amp; </em><a title=\"https://plus.google.com/101164570444913213957/posts\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/101164570444913213957/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em>.

What makes this discovery notable is that it occurred just two years after the species suffered from a severe epidemic called &ldquo;sea star wasting disease.&rdquo;</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>&ldquo;When we looked at the settlement of the larval sea stars on rocks in 2014 during the epidemic, it was the same or maybe even a bit lower than previous years,&rdquo; Bruce Menge, a professor of marine biology at Oregon State University and lead author on the study, said in <a href=\"http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2016/may/sea-star-juveniles-abundant-recovery-anything-guaranteed\" target=\"_blank\">a press release</a>. &ldquo;But a few months later, the number of juveniles was off the charts &mdash; higher than we&rsquo;d ever seen &mdash; as much as 300 times normal.&rdquo;</p><br />\n<p>Yet the reason isn&rsquo;t a recent baby boom.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a case of high settlement, or more sea stars being born. They just had an extraordinary survival rate into the juvenile stage. Whether they can make it into adulthood and replenish the population without succumbing to sea star wasting disease is the big question.&rdquo;</p><br />\n<p>Menge and his team believe the reason behind the high survival rate is simple. Young sea stars and adults compete for the same food source. But because there are not many adults due to disease, the kiddies had more food, or a temporary seafood smorgasbord, if you will.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Ochre sea stars (or Pisaster ochraceus), eat mostly barnacles and mussels and these key factor in their diet makes them a <a href=\"http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb310/lecture-notes/interactions/node2.html\" target=\"_blank\">keystone species</a> &mdash; or a species that has a huge impact on its ecosystem. If starfish are not available to eat barnacles and mussels, these populations will explode and crowd out other species like algae and small invertebrates.</p><br />\n<p>The OSU researchers also found in their study that gooseneck barnacles have erupted along the Pacific coast, most likely because the lack of adult sea stars.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Oregon_Islands/wildlife_and_habitat/sea_star_wasting.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sea star wasting disease</a> first appeared in the Pacific coast in the summer of 2014. Starfish that contracted the disease would first develop twisted arms, lesions, lost arms and then finally disintegrated or &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/17/starfish-melting_n_6161792.html\">melted</a>&rdquo; completely. The epidemic spread from Alaska to Baja, California, and wiped out 80 to 99 percent of the ochre sea star population.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Interestingly, starfish have been living with the virus for decades and <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/scientists-solve-mystery-of-west-coast-starfish-deaths/\" target=\"_blank\">scientists have found</a> traces of it in preserved starfish that date back to the 1940s.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably been sort of smoldering at a low level for a very long time,&rdquo; Ian Hewson, a microbiologist at Cornell University, told <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/scientists-solve-mystery-of-west-coast-starfish-deaths/\" target=\"_blank\">PBS</a>.</p><br />\n<p><a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/scientists-now-link-massive-starfish-die-off-warming-ocean/\" target=\"_blank\">Some scientists believe</a> that the disease was triggered by warmer water temperatures, but Menge &mdash; who has been studying intertidal rocky zones at different sites for over 30 years &mdash; thinks that theory is too simplistic. He points out that when the virus hit the coast of Oregon, water temperatures were actually colder than usual.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think it was a result of warming because conditions were different in Oregon than they were, for example, in Washington and likely other parts of the West Coast,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ocean acidification is one possibility and we&rsquo;re looking at that now. Ultimately, the cause seems likely to be multi-faceted.&rdquo;</p><br />\n <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/57337ec22200004207256541.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/11/leadership-intelligence-daniel-goleman_n_9929366.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Here's Why The Best Bosses Don't Always Have The Highest IQs]]></title>\n      <author>Lisa Capretto</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/11/leadership-intelligence-daniel-goleman_n_9929366.html?utm_hp_ref=science&amp;ir=Science</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:01:41 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\"><br />\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><div id=\"vidible_14630665631\" class=\"vdb_player vdb_56de0fc2e4b0fcd4b4570095551440e81146fb0d084da520\" vdb_params=\"m.fwkeyvalues=sponsorship%3DSPONSORSHIP_NAME&amp;m.fwsitesection=composer\"><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=56de0fc2e4b0fcd4b4570095/vid=56eedad4e4b08af505fedac2/551440e81146fb0d084da520.js\"></script></div></div><script type='text/javascript'>function onPlayerReadyVidible(e){'undefined'!=typeof HPTrack&&HPTrack.Vid.Vidible_track(e)}!function(e,i){if(e.vdb_Player){if('object'==typeof commercial_video){var a='',o='m.fwsitesection='+commercial_video.site_and_category;if(a+=o,commercial_video['package']){var c='&m.fwkeyvalues=sponsorship%3D'+commercial_video['package'];a+=c}e.setAttribute('vdb_params',a)}i(e.vdb_Player)}else{var t=arguments.callee;setTimeout(function(){t(e,i)},0)}}(document.getElementById('vidible_1'),onPlayerReadyVidible);</script></div><br />\n     <br />\n<p>When renowned science journalist and psychologist Daniel Goleman was giving a talk once to a room full of business leaders and CEOs, he asked them a revealing question. \"How many of you were valedictorians? The smartest kid in your class?\"</p><br />\n<p>Out of 200-300 hundred people in the room, Goleman says only three hands went up.</p><br />\n<p>That's right. Three.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Goleman told this story to Oprah during a conversation on OWN's \"SuperSoul Sunday\" to highlight a point that he explores in his often-referenced book, <em>Emotional Intelligence</em>: <a href=\"http://www.supersoul.tv/supersoul-sunday/why-daniel-goleman-says-a-high-iq-doesnt-predict-success\">IQ and success are not directly, exclusively related</a>.</p><br />\n<p>\"Your IQ, your academic abilities, your cognitive brilliance is <em>not</em> what's going to matter the most,\" Goleman says. In other words, the smartest people are not always the best leaders or best bosses.</p><br />\n<p>While intellect certainly plays an initial role in one's success -- it's like a threshold that \"gets you in the game,\" Goleman says -- a high IQ isn't the most reliable predictor of strong leadership. \"It's not going to tell you if you're going to emerge as a team leader, as a star,\" he explains.</p><br />\n<p>Instead, Goleman emphasizes the importance of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/types-of-empathy_us_56f171cde4b03a640a6bcc17\">fostering emotional intelligence</a> and understanding its ability to drive people to greater heights.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;It's how you handle other people, how you handle yourself... Do you know what you&rsquo;re feeling? Why you&rsquo;re feeling it?&rdquo; he poses. &ldquo;Do you know how to manage those feelings? Do you know what someone else is feeling? Can you put it together and have a good interaction and good relationship?\"</p><br />\n<p>To nurture your emotional intelligence, Goleman suggest beginning with self-reflection and meditation, which he says can lead to a clearer self-awareness -- and a more in-sync spiritual and professional course.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>\"You have to make time to have that reflection,\" he asserts. \"Once you have that, then you can handle yourself in a way that aligns with your own sense of purpose, meaning, ethics and values.\"&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><strong>Another piece of advice from Goleman:</strong></p><br />\n<p><a href=\"http://www.supersoul.tv/supersoul-sunday/why-we-need-to-foster-emotional-intelligence-in-our-kids\">How to help children become more successful adults by encouraging one simple exercise</a></p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/5733b3ea130000f004381599.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/09/what-nurses-keep-in-their-bathroom-cabinets_n_9925498.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[What 5 Nurses Keep In Their Medicine Cabinets]]></title>\n      <author>Erin Schumaker</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/09/what-nurses-keep-in-their-bathroom-cabinets_n_9925498.html?utm_hp_ref=science&amp;ir=Science</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 07:00:57 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<br />\n<p>Snooping inside a medicine cabinet while using the bathroom during a party is a particular guilty pleasure.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>What eye cream does your host use?
