We speak with Suuns guitarist/bassist Joe Yarmush about the collaboration as well as the upcoming release from Suuns themselves, expected early 2016.\r\n\r\nDIlshad Burman is the award-winning host of V-MIX.

Though Isaiah has spent considerable time in Europe and the U.S., and is known in some circles as much for his award-winning short films (under the name Daniel Schachter), CIG is a distinctly local work. The new album was written in his cozy Mile End flat, in a 10-foot by 10-foot room with a perfect view of Mont-Royal, and a little piano in it hauled over from Halifax, on which many of the songs were composed. Isaiah had never taken this approach before, but through it he found chords that he wouldn\u2019t have on his usual guitar. And though writing the songs took considerable time, not much rehearsing or preparation went into recording them. The looseness of the recordings works so well precisely because the songs are so well crafted.\r\n\r\nWe also catch up with 3/4 of the bill for the April 2nd edition of Generation Next Live at The Phoenix in Toronto in electro-rock four-piece DLV, alt quartet The Control Room, and upbeat indie pop trio Goodnight, Sunrise.

We'll speak with all three about their recent and upcoming releases and see where the similarities and differences lie as far as their approach to writing, performing, and building a career in music.\r\n\r\nThe brainchild of frontman and pricipal songwriter Cary Pratt, Prairie Cat is fresh off the release of Who Knows Where To Begin? The touring band features a few familiar faces from the west coast music community and we'll chat with Cary about his songs and how they come to life on the stage.\r\n\r\nAs for Shimmering Stars, they're even fresher off the release of their second and latest LP, Bedrooms of the Nation. The album integrates elements from across the pop, noise, punk, and experimental spectrums - The Pixies, Flipper, Yo La Tengo, Women, and Nirvana running head into The Beach Boys, Phil Spector, and 50s/60s AM radio.\r\n\r\nFinally, the cats in Coyote have their first full-length dropping in the coming weeks, and in addition to the unique sound they've crafted, we'll speak about their adventures as a band thus far - which most recently included the theft and recovery of close to $10,000 worth of musical equipment.\r\n</itunes:summary><itunes:duration>00:58:00</itunes:duration><itunes:author>Canadian Musician Radio</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>music industry,music news,music industry news,coyote,shimmering stars</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>It's indie pop week for Canadian Musician Radio, and we're reaching from sea to sea for this one.

She's performed the Viper Room in LA, the Bluebird in Nashville, and major Canadian country festivals like the Cavendish Beach Music Festival, Big Valley Jamboree, Boots and Hearts, and Calgary Stampede. We'll speak to the Alberta CMA nominee about the year she's had and what's coming up on the horizon.\r\n\r\nThen, switching gears, we've got one of Canadian rock's hottest acts, Saskatoon's One Bad Son. Over the past couple of years, the band has had multiple radio hits, toured alongside Buckcherry, Three Days Grace, and Monster Truck, and is currently prepping for an upcoming Fall 2014 release. We'll chat about the progress on that and what fans can expect from the four-piece powerhouse.\r\n]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[We've got a great pair of aritst interviews this week, and they certainly contrast as far as musical styles go.\r\n\r\nFirst up, we bring you a conversation with on-the-rise country performer Trinity Bradshaw.

The album title even is a big part of the story here - a symbol of Afie taking ownership of the name Bahamas. It\u2019s a self titled record of sorts, that for lack of a better term is kind of a revealing moment in his career which has come with some high acclaim both here in Canada and the US and overseas. The music is expansive, thoughtful, full of huge catchy hooks that are at the same time beautiful and a really fun listen. He also unleashes some incredible guitar playing to boot. Be sure to keep an eye for that...\r\n\r\nWe've also got an interview with Nathan Gill, frontman of Charlottetown rock outfit The North Lakes, talking about the band's in-the-works third release.

With all of these great summer festivals and tours, we've been able to deliver a heap of artist interviews, and this week is no different.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we catch up with Juno-winning six-piece \"folk popgrass\" outfit The Strumbellas, singer-songwriter Astrid Young (also the half-sister of the one and only Neil), and Ryan McCambridge.\r\n\r\nThe Strumbellas are playing summer festivals across Canada and the U.S. this summer, continuing to promote the sophomore album, We Still Move Dance Floors. While its predecessor, My Father and the Hunter, was nominated for a Juno Award for Roots &amp; Traditional Album of the Year in 2013,We Still Move Dance Floors actually took the trophy earlier in 2014 and was recently long-listed for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize. They're more focused than ever now, and we'll find out why.\r\n\r\nMusician, composer, actor, author screenwriter, and sommelier Astrid Young released her fourth solo record, One Night at Giant Rock, at the end of June. In a special performance, Young is kicking off her \"psychedelic acid folk\" tour in southern Ontario in late July and will work her way west. The album, featuring Victor DeLorenzo of the Violent Femmes is a collection of songs that reflect her personal discovery of the karmic meaning of all her relationships. She speaks about the long gaps between records, some of her other musical endeavors, and more.\r\n\r\nFinally, in addition to being a studio engineer who's been the right hand man of producer/engineer David Bottrill (Peter Gabriel, Tool, Dream Theater), Ryan McCambridge has been making music under the moniker of A Calmer Collision.
