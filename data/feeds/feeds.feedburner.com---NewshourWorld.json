She greeted the crowd, and declared her defiance.</p>\n<p><strong>DILMA ROUSSEFF</strong>, Suspended\u00a0President, Brazil (through interpreter): This process is a coup, because it&#8217;s an impeachment without a crime. I didn&#8217;t commit a crime of responsibility. I am being the target, a victim of a great injustice.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Rousseff&#8217;s impassioned speech came just hours after Brazil&#8217;s Senate voted 55-22 to remove her from office, at least temporarily. Her critics included another former president who was impeached in 1992.</p>\n<p><strong>FERNANDO COLLOR DE MELLO</strong>, Senator, Christian Labor Party\u00a0(through interpreter): We arrived at the peak of a crisis. We have arrived at the ruin of a government, at the ruin of a country. The greatest crime of responsibility is in the irresponsibility and disregard of politics, the irresponsibility for the deterioration of the economy of a country.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Supporters of Rousseff, including Brazil&#8217;s attorney general, branded the move a historic injustice.</p>\n<p><strong>JOSE EDUARDO CARDOZO</strong>, Attorney General, Brazil (through interpreter): An honest and innocent woman, right at this moment, IS being condemned. A judicial presence is being used to oust a legitimately elected president. An innocent person is being condemned.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Outside, pro-Rousseff demonstrators briefly clashed with police. But in cities across the country, there were fireworks celebrating the vote. The divisions were evident everywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>MAN</strong> (through interpreter): I used to like Dilma a lot, but at this moment I think Brazil should be congratulated, and I am sure things will get much better.</p>\n<p><strong>WOMAN</strong> (through interpreter): It is very saddening to know that an honest woman will lose the presidency and was judged by criminals.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: The drive to take down Rousseff began last year as anger spread over an extensive corruption scandal at Petrobras, Brazil&#8217;s state-owned oil company. Rousseff herself was never implicated in the corruption. Instead, she was charged with manipulating government accounts to cover up the country&#8217;s deficit. She insisted her decisions were entirely legal.</p>\n<p><strong>DILMA ROUSSEFF</strong> (through interpreter): I carried out those actions. These actions have been taken by all the presidents of the republic who have been in office.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Even so, the impeachment process morphed into a referendum on Rousseff&#8217;s entire presidency, as the worst downturn in decades laid waste to the country&#8217;s economy.</p>\n<p>Simon Romero is the Brazil bureau chief for The New York Times.</p>\n<p><strong>SIMON ROMERO</strong>, The New York Times: There was a booming economy back in the previous decade. It was an emerging powerhouse on the global stage. But Brazil&#8217;s own recession has just become so severe and the wounds to the economy are to be self-inflicted by the policies that Dilma Rousseff was championing just a few years ago, that really her government just became unsustainable in that sense.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Rousseff was elected president in 2010, the first woman to hold the office. She&#8217;d once belonged to a Marxist guerrilla group and was tortured during years of a military dictatorship. But she endured, and ultimately became chief of staff in the administration of popular leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, during which 30 million people were brought out of poverty. Rousseff was his handpicked successor.</p>\n<p>Now the Senate has 180 days to hold a trial, and decide whether to make her removal permanent. She insisted today she&#8217;s far from finished.</p>\n<p><strong>DILMA ROUSSEFF</strong> (through interpreter): We will remain united, mobilized, and peaceful. We are those that know how to fight the daily fight.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: For now, the 75-year-old vice president, Michel Temer, is acting president. He&#8217;s promised to cut spending and privatize many state-controlled sectors, but he&#8217;s also been implicated in the Petrobras scandal.</p>\n<p><strong>SIMON ROMERO</strong>: The most recent poll by one of the country&#8217;s biggest polling companies put his approval ratings in the single digits, and only 2 percent of the respondents in that poll said that they would vote for him for president.

A top Russian Olympic official says that his government orchestrated a plan to supply dozens of athletes with performance-enhancing drugs.</p>\n<p>The head of Russia&#8217;s anti-doping lab during the competition in Sochi, Russia, Grigory Rodchenkov, told The New York Times he created a cocktail of drugs for a state-run doping program that included 15 medal winners. Among those alleged to have received drugs are members of the cross-country ski team and two bobsledders who won two gold medals.</p>\n<p>Russian officials deny the accusations.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Ruiz is one of The Times reporters, and she joins me now.</p>\n<p>Rebecca, thank you for talking with us.</p>\n<p>There have been rumors, I guess, in the air for a long time about banned substances being used by Russian athletes. What exactly did you learn?</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA RUIZ</strong>, The New York Times: Well, not just rumors, Judy. It&#8217;s fascinating, because Russia does lead the world in doping violations among its athletes internationally.</p>\n<p>But what is fascinating, Mr. Rodchenkov provided incredible details that in many ways validated a report that came out last fall. It was published by the World Anti-Doping Agency, and it was the result of an almost-year-long inquiry. He confirmed a lot of what the WADA report had said broadly.</p>\n<p>The WADA report said that at the Olympic laboratory in Sochi in 2014, there had been a police presence, that FSB officers, the Russian police, had been present on site in the laboratory. Some had been seen in lab coats.</p>\n<p>He provided details that some of those agents he worked with every night to substitute out the tainted urine of top Russian athletes who were expected to win medals at the Games.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: So, essentially, he is saying the government was behind this?</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA RUIZ</strong>: He is saying that the sports ministry gave him direct orders to operate, to follow &#8212; to execute these orders and to &#8212; quote, unquote &#8212; &#8220;win at any cost.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: So, Rebecca, why is he, why is Mr. Rodchenkov coming forward? Why is he talking?</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA RUIZ</strong>: Well, ahead of the Summer Games in Rio, which are in three months, Mr. Rodchenkov said he wants it known that there is state-sponsored doping in Russia, that a lot of these athletes who are due to compete in Rio, he said, without providing names of those competing in the Summer Games, that they have been on his three-drug cocktail in years past.</p>\n<p>And, meanwhile, track and field athletes, Russia&#8217;s track and field athletes were suspended from global competition in the wake of the report last fall. So, currently, officials are deciding whether that ban will be lifted in advance of the Olympics in August.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: We saw that the Russian government is saying it isn&#8217;t true. He said this is simply a continuation of the information attack on Russian sport.</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA RUIZ</strong>: Yes, that&#8217;s what officials told us as well, and we absolutely included their denials of our allegations. We reached out to the six sports federations whose athletes were implicated, whose names we had in this spreadsheet that showed dozens of athletes who competed at the Sochi Games who Mr. Rodchenkov says doped throughout the games and many of whom captured medals.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: Is Mr. Rodchenkov safe in the United States? I ask because you report that two of his former close colleagues back in Russia died unexpectedly a few months ago, just within a few weeks of each other.</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA RUIZ</strong>: That&#8217;s correct.</p>\n<p>In fact, he departed in November. He fled to the United States, fearing for his safety. He went to Los Angeles. We&#8217;re not giving any specifics about his location beyond that. But two of his close colleagues from the anti-doping world did die unexpectedly, suddenly, in February within weeks of each other.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: And just finally, Rebecca, is the International Olympic Committee, is anyone investigating this now?</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA RUIZ:</strong> We contacted the International Olympic Committee today. They said that they were worried about these very detailed allegations, and they called on WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, to act and to investigate his specific claims.</p>\n<p>WADA, meanwhile, has had board meetings today in Canada, and we have been unable to connect with any WADA official by phone and to get specific answers to our questions. But they have said that they are looking into allegations of doping by Russian athletes throughout the Olympic Games in Sochi, not just before the Games, in the lead-up to the Games, as Mr. Rodchenkov also said happened at past competitions, leading up to Beijing, leading up to London.</p>\n<p>But he says that, throughout the entirety of the Sochi Games, Russian athletes were doping.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: Well, quite a story.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Ruiz, who reported on this for The New York Times, we thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA RUIZ</strong>: Thank you very much, Judy.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/russian-official-levels-new-charges-in-2014-winter-olympics-doping-scheme/\">Russian official levels new charges in 2014 Winter Olympics doping scheme</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe class='partnerPlayer' frameborder='0' marginwidth='0' marginheight='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' src='http://player.pbs.org/widget/partnerplayer/2365753619/?start=0&end=0&chapterbar=false&endscreen=false' allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: Now: new revelations about an elaborate scheme of alleged doping at the 2014 Winter Olympics.

There are signs that the Taliban is now strengthening again. And ISIS is making its presence felt, too.</p>\n<p>The U.S. and NATO formally ended their combat mission in 2014, but thousands of foreign troops remain to aid in the fight.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re joined now by special correspondent Jennifer Glasse in Kabul.</p>\n<p>Jennifer, we have noticed an increase in the number of headlines about violence, the car bombs and so forth from Afghanistan. Put this in perspective. How active is this fighting?</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GLASSE</strong>: Well, Hari, we have seen fighting around the country. The Taliban announced their spring offensive in April.</p>\n<p>And, of course, we have seen them fighting in the north in Kunduz. There was a large attack here in Kabul about a week after they announced the spring offensive. But just in the last 10 days or so, we&#8217;re seeing an uptick in fighting in their heartland, in Helmand in the south of the country.</p>\n<p>We spoke to people in Lashkar Gah. That&#8217;s the provincial capital of Helmand province. And they are very concerned. They say there&#8217;s been a lot of fighting, especially in the last nine or 10 days. They can actually hear the gunfire in the center of the city.</p>\n<p>They say the Taliban have tried to attack a number of areas around the city, in the ring of security around the city. They have managed to take a few checkpoints, and, yesterday, 15 Afghan policemen were killed.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: All right, so it seems that multiple forces here, Taliban on one side, maybe ISIS on the other. Any idea of the scale of how large this opposition is?</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GLASSE</strong>: We don&#8217;t know exactly how many fighters there are. The Taliban claimed to have thousands of fighters ready to launch an offensive this year.</p>\n<p>They usually exaggerate their numbers. What is clear then is the Taliban can inflict very, very large damage. Last year, Afghan security forces took very heavy casualties, 5,500 killed. That&#8217;s about 15 a day, and 14 &#8212; about 14,000 injured. That was 2015 alone, and they&#8217;re bracing for another difficult year.</p>\n<p>The Taliban have been effective in the kind of attacks they have carried out. So, even when they took Kunduz for three days last year, the first time they took a city, they only went in, stayed for three days, and went out. It really created a lot of fear. It was very effective, and yet they have been able to hold a lot of area in the country.</p>\n<p>And things have really picked up just in the last 10 days or so because it&#8217;s the end of the poppy harvest season, the opium harvest season in the south. A lot of Taliban fighters take part in that opium harvest. We&#8217;re told it&#8217;s going to be a bumper crop. And so, of course, that&#8217;s a lot more money for the Taliban.</p>\n<p>As for ISIS, they are largely in the east of the country, and their numbers are estimated to be in the hundreds, but it&#8217;s very hard to tell.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: How involved is the American military in these battles?</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GLASSE</strong>: Well, there are about 10,000 U.S. forces still here. They have got two missions, train, advise, and assist, and a counterterrorism mission.</p>\n<p>Now, we know that Afghan special forces have been fighting alongside Afghan forces. We just learned recently that in the &#8212; in Kunduz last September and October, when the Taliban took the city for three days, American special forces were fighting very actively in Kunduz.</p>\n<p>We know that there are also American special forces guiding Afghan special forces in Helmand province, and about several hundred, about 500 or more U.S. army troops from the 10th Mountain Division are in Helmand province now. They got there in February. Now, that&#8217;s a big mission. They&#8217;re trying to reform and retrain the army 215 Corps.</p>\n<p>They have fired all the commanders and all the leaders there.

There are signs that the Taliban is now strengthening again. And ISIS is making its presence felt, too.</p>\n<p>The U.S. and NATO formally ended their combat mission in 2014, but thousands of foreign troops remain to aid in the fight.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re joined now by special correspondent Jennifer Glasse in Kabul.</p>\n<p>Jennifer, we have noticed an increase in the number of headlines about violence, the car bombs and so forth from Afghanistan. Put this in perspective. How active is this fighting?</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GLASSE</strong>: Well, Hari, we have seen fighting around the country. The Taliban announced their spring offensive in April.</p>\n<p>And, of course, we have seen them fighting in the north in Kunduz. There was a large attack here in Kabul about a week after they announced the spring offensive. But just in the last 10 days or so, we&#8217;re seeing an uptick in fighting in their heartland, in Helmand in the south of the country.</p>\n<p>We spoke to people in Lashkar Gah. That&#8217;s the provincial capital of Helmand province. And they are very concerned. They say there&#8217;s been a lot of fighting, especially in the last nine or 10 days. They can actually hear the gunfire in the center of the city.</p>\n<p>They say the Taliban have tried to attack a number of areas around the city, in the ring of security around the city. They have managed to take a few checkpoints, and, yesterday, 15 Afghan policemen were killed.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: All right, so it seems that multiple forces here, Taliban on one side, maybe ISIS on the other. Any idea of the scale of how large this opposition is?</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GLASSE</strong>: We don&#8217;t know exactly how many fighters there are. The Taliban claimed to have thousands of fighters ready to launch an offensive this year.</p>\n<p>They usually exaggerate their numbers. What is clear then is the Taliban can inflict very, very large damage. Last year, Afghan security forces took very heavy casualties, 5,500 killed. That&#8217;s about 15 a day, and 14 &#8212; about 14,000 injured. That was 2015 alone, and they&#8217;re bracing for another difficult year.</p>\n<p>The Taliban have been effective in the kind of attacks they have carried out. So, even when they took Kunduz for three days last year, the first time they took a city, they only went in, stayed for three days, and went out. It really created a lot of fear. It was very effective, and yet they have been able to hold a lot of area in the country.</p>\n<p>And things have really picked up just in the last 10 days or so because it&#8217;s the end of the poppy harvest season, the opium harvest season in the south. A lot of Taliban fighters take part in that opium harvest. We&#8217;re told it&#8217;s going to be a bumper crop. And so, of course, that&#8217;s a lot more money for the Taliban.</p>\n<p>As for ISIS, they are largely in the east of the country, and their numbers are estimated to be in the hundreds, but it&#8217;s very hard to tell.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: How involved is the American military in these battles?</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GLASSE</strong>: Well, there are about 10,000 U.S. forces still here. They have got two missions, train, advise, and assist, and a counterterrorism mission.</p>\n<p>Now, we know that Afghan special forces have been fighting alongside Afghan forces. We just learned recently that in the &#8212; in Kunduz last September and October, when the Taliban took the city for three days, American special forces were fighting very actively in Kunduz.</p>\n<p>We know that there are also American special forces guiding Afghan special forces in Helmand province, and about several hundred, about 500 or more U.S. army troops from the 10th Mountain Division are in Helmand province now. They got there in February. Now, that&#8217;s a big mission. They&#8217;re trying to reform and retrain the army 215 Corps.</p>\n<p>They have fired all the commanders and all the leaders there. They are trying to get the Afghans to be a little bit more aggressive, to get off checkpoints and to engage the Taliban more effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Now, there has also been some change in military leadership on the American side. Has there been any sort of a strategy or a vision laid out on what might change in the near future?</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GLASSE</strong>: Well, we know that the new commander here, General Nicholson, is conducting a 90-day review as to what should happen next.</p>\n<p>Right now, there are 9,800 U.S. forces in country.

But how big of an impact is the change in specifically oil or energy leadership in Saudi Arabia?</p>\n<p><strong>SARAH LADISLAW</strong>, Center for Strategic &amp;\u00a0International Studies: Well, it&#8217;s pretty significant, especially if you take the long view of leadership on energy policy within Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>I think both of the response that they had the response that they had to the oil &#8212; the sort of overcapacity in oil supply in the oil market in 2014, which have led to the period we are now, where you have sort of lower oil prices, was really the turning point for the way people viewed the role that Saudi Arabia was going to play in the markets.</p>\n<p>I think what happened over the weekend was a much-anticipated leadership shift that falls in line with that broader message of, you know, we&#8217;re going to play a new and different role in the oil market. We have a new sort of economic diversification strategy. And now we&#8217;re going to have both the institutional structure and sort of the leadership to lead that.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Simon Henderson, how much of this has to do with a power grab or power struggle or shuffle inside Saudi Arabia, the deputy crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, putting his fingerprint on things?</p>\n<p><strong>SIMON HENDERSON</strong>, The Washington Institute: Well, he&#8217;s certainly putting his fingerprint on things.</p>\n<p>This is a young man, 30 years old. And he has risen from nowhere, or mostly nowhere. But he is the son of the king, King Salman, and so when King Salman came to the throne last year, since then, this young man has had a meteoric rise.</p>\n<p>And he appears to have a vision, an economic vision. He&#8217;s announced a grand plan for vision 2030, which is a much less of a role for oil. And I suspect also he&#8217;s got a vision for himself, that he wants to be the next king of Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Sarah, what about that Vision 2030 project, the idea we equate or we connect Saudi Arabia with oil in our heads, the idea that they could be less fossil-fuel-dependent in 15 years?</p>\n<p><strong>SARAH LADISLAW</strong>: Well, I think it follows along the lines of what you have seen coming out of Saudi Arabian energy ministers and political leadership for awhile, which is this recognition that the energy landscape is changing, right?</p>\n<p>They understand that climate change is an issue that a lot of different countries take seriously. They have talked about it quite openly. They are involved in most of the major multilateral initiatives to deal with climate change.</p>\n<p>And I think if we weren&#8217;t talking about their broad reform effort, we would be talking about their need to undertake economic reform at some point, given the outlook for oil markets, given the role &#8212; the outsized role that it plays in their own economy. And so, in many ways, this new vision is actually an extension and a much bolder extension of domestic economic reform that people have thought needed to happen in the kingdom for a long time.</p>\n<p>I think the thing that people are surprised about is that it&#8217;s happening at a much faster pace than people are used to seeing coming from the Saudi kingdom.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Put this in perspective to the struggle that is happening between Saudi Arabia and Iran right now.</p>\n<p><strong>SIMON HENDERSON</strong>: It&#8217;s such a struggle. And it dominates so much thinking, certainly in Riyadh.</p>\n<p>The house of Saud, the Saudi family, are immensely suspicious of Iran and, frankly, on religious terms, as Sunni Muslims, they&#8217;re very suspicious of Shiite Muslims of Iran. On top of that, the Iranian nuclear program concerns them. And they think the deal which the Obama administration led last year is a lousy deal.</p>\n<p>And so they&#8217;re very concerned about that. For the moment, though, it&#8217;s a question of oil price. Originally, when the Saudis allowed the price of oil to fall, their target were U.S. shale producers. And to an extent, they have made it uncomfortable for U.S. shale producers. But they have got a new target now, which is Iran, which wants to expand its oil production.</p>\n<p>If that&#8217;s going to happen, the Saudis don&#8217;t want the Iranians to get much revenue out of it. So, they &#8212; this is an additional argument why they want to keep the price of oil comparatively low.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Sarah Ladislaw, how do they stay competitive here? Iran wants to wake up out of these sanctions. They want to get their market going and find a lot of customers.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Saudi Arabia can pull more crude oil out of the ground faster than anyone else. And &#8212; but they need that money for their society to function.</p>\n<p><strong>SARAH LADISLAW</strong>: It&#8217;s a great question.</p>\n<p>I mean, I think when you look at the &#8212; what the Saudis contribute to the oil market historically and currently, it&#8217;s about 10 million barrels a day. And they have, as you said, the lowest listing costs in the world. And they have spare capacity, which means they can bring more on quickly.</p>\n<p>I think that the real challenge for them is &#8212; looking at this period long term, is to try and insulate their economy from volatile oil markets, right? I mean, part of what people see in their activity today is some of this sort of geopolitical rivalry.</p>\n<p>But if you look at it from an oil market perspective back in 2014, there is really nothing they could have done to stabilize oil markets at that time. And, therefore, they&#8217;re using the market to basically get rid of the higher cost oil in the system and then, you know, look for being able to keep a market share perspective going forward.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been fairly successful thus far.

But how big of an impact is the change in specifically oil or energy leadership in Saudi Arabia?</p>\n<p><strong>SARAH LADISLAW</strong>, Center for Strategic &amp;\u00a0International Studies: Well, it&#8217;s pretty significant, especially if you take the long view of leadership on energy policy within Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>I think both of the response that they had the response that they had to the oil &#8212; the sort of overcapacity in oil supply in the oil market in 2014, which have led to the period we are now, where you have sort of lower oil prices, was really the turning point for the way people viewed the role that Saudi Arabia was going to play in the markets.</p>\n<p>I think what happened over the weekend was a much-anticipated leadership shift that falls in line with that broader message of, you know, we&#8217;re going to play a new and different role in the oil market. We have a new sort of economic diversification strategy. And now we&#8217;re going to have both the institutional structure and sort of the leadership to lead that.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Simon Henderson, how much of this has to do with a power grab or power struggle or shuffle inside Saudi Arabia, the deputy crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, putting his fingerprint on things?</p>\n<p><strong>SIMON HENDERSON</strong>, The Washington Institute: Well, he&#8217;s certainly putting his fingerprint on things.</p>\n<p>This is a young man, 30 years old. And he has risen from nowhere, or mostly nowhere. But he is the son of the king, King Salman, and so when King Salman came to the throne last year, since then, this young man has had a meteoric rise.</p>\n<p>And he appears to have a vision, an economic vision. He&#8217;s announced a grand plan for vision 2030, which is a much less of a role for oil. And I suspect also he&#8217;s got a vision for himself, that he wants to be the next king of Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Sarah, what about that Vision 2030 project, the idea we equate or we connect Saudi Arabia with oil in our heads, the idea that they could be less fossil-fuel-dependent in 15 years?</p>\n<p><strong>SARAH LADISLAW</strong>: Well, I think it follows along the lines of what you have seen coming out of Saudi Arabian energy ministers and political leadership for awhile, which is this recognition that the energy landscape is changing, right?</p>\n<p>They understand that climate change is an issue that a lot of different countries take seriously. They have talked about it quite openly. They are involved in most of the major multilateral initiatives to deal with climate change.</p>\n<p>And I think if we weren&#8217;t talking about their broad reform effort, we would be talking about their need to undertake economic reform at some point, given the outlook for oil markets, given the role &#8212; the outsized role that it plays in their own economy. And so, in many ways, this new vision is actually an extension and a much bolder extension of domestic economic reform that people have thought needed to happen in the kingdom for a long time.</p>\n<p>I think the thing that people are surprised about is that it&#8217;s happening at a much faster pace than people are used to seeing coming from the Saudi kingdom.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Put this in perspective to the struggle that is happening between Saudi Arabia and Iran right now.</p>\n<p><strong>SIMON HENDERSON</strong>: It&#8217;s such a struggle. And it dominates so much thinking, certainly in Riyadh.</p>\n<p>The house of Saud, the Saudi family, are immensely suspicious of Iran and, frankly, on religious terms, as Sunni Muslims, they&#8217;re very suspicious of Shiite Muslims of Iran. On top of that, the Iranian nuclear program concerns them. And they think the deal which the Obama administration led last year is a lousy deal.</p>\n<p>And so they&#8217;re very concerned about that. For the moment, though, it&#8217;s a question of oil price. Originally, when the Saudis allowed the price of oil to fall, their target were U.S. shale producers. And to an extent, they have made it uncomfortable for U.S. shale producers. But they have got a new target now, which is Iran, which wants to expand its oil production.</p>\n<p>If that&#8217;s going to happen, the Saudis don&#8217;t want the Iranians to get much revenue out of it. So, they &#8212; this is an additional argument why they want to keep the price of oil comparatively low.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Sarah Ladislaw, how do they stay competitive here? Iran wants to wake up out of these sanctions. They want to get their market going and find a lot of customers.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Saudi Arabia can pull more crude oil out of the ground faster than anyone else. And &#8212; but they need that money for their society to function.</p>\n<p><strong>SARAH LADISLAW</strong>: It&#8217;s a great question.</p>\n<p>I mean, I think when you look at the &#8212; what the Saudis contribute to the oil market historically and currently, it&#8217;s about 10 million barrels a day. And they have, as you said, the lowest listing costs in the world. And they have spare capacity, which means they can bring more on quickly.</p>\n<p>I think that the real challenge for them is &#8212; looking at this period long term, is to try and insulate their economy from volatile oil markets, right? I mean, part of what people see in their activity today is some of this sort of geopolitical rivalry.</p>\n<p>But if you look at it from an oil market perspective back in 2014, there is really nothing they could have done to stabilize oil markets at that time. And, therefore, they&#8217;re using the market to basically get rid of the higher cost oil in the system and then, you know, look for being able to keep a market share perspective going forward.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been fairly successful thus far. We were oversupplied by about two million barrels a day about a year-and-a-half ago. And things are starting to come into balance. The question going forward really for any major oil-producing economy is, how in charge of their oil economy will they be? What kind of &#8212; what can they do to ratchet up or down production?</p>\n<p>And for them, it&#8217;s really a question of how dependent they are on that revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: All right, Sarah Ladislaw, Simon Henderson, thanks so much.</p>\n<p><strong>SARAH LADISLAW</strong>: Thank you.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/oil-reliant-saudi-arabia-envisions-a-new-economic-path/\">Oil-reliant Saudi Arabia envisions a new economic path</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NewshourWorld/~4/fFv89qMPq6E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\t\r\n\r\n\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/oil-reliant-saudi-arabia-envisions-a-new-economic-path/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160509_OilreliantSaudi.mp3\" length=\"4194304\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" /> <itunes:duration>6:21</itunes:duration> <itunes:summary>As global oil prices drop, Saudi Arabia is struggling against its reliance on oil export revenues.

Tens of thousands died, and millions were made refugees.</p>\n<p>Bosnian Serbs were largely responsible for driving Muslim families from their homes during the early stages of the war. Now many hope the reopening of a United Nations Heritage Site, a mosque, in the Serbian town of Banja Luka is a big step on the road to reconciliation.</p>\n<p>Special correspondent Malcolm Brabant has the story.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: The Muslim call to prayer rang out from the 16th Century Ferhadija Mosque 23 years to the day that Serb militiamen blew it to pieces; 10,000 Muslims traveled to Banja Luka to witness this act of renaissance, a generation after the Serbs had attempted to systematically erase not only the population, but also their culture and heritage.</p>\n<p>Ibrahim Ahmedbasic lost his legs in one of the worst single attacks of the war. He was 21 when a Serb mortar exploded in the town of Tuzla, killing 71 and injuring 250.</p>\n<p><strong>IBRAHIM AHMEDBASIC</strong>, Bosnian Muslim (through interpreter): When the mosques began to be reconstructed, people started to coexist again. So you can see, people are capable of living normally.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: The Bosnian War was the most vicious of those that accompanied the break up of former Yugoslavia, largely because of the population&#8217;s complicated ethnic and religious mix. The conflict began in a wave of nationalism in 1992, when the Christian Orthodox Bosnian Serbs attempted a land grab and attacked areas occupied by predominantly Catholic Bosnian Croats and Muslims.</p>\n<p>In 1993, the country fragmented still further, when the Croats launched an offensive against the Muslims. Peace finally arrived in 1995 with a deal signed in Dayton, Ohio. The accord preserved Bosnia as a single state, but as two separate entities, a Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb Republic; 21 years later, the divisions are as entrenched as ever.</p>\n<p>Banja Luka is the capital of the Serb Republic, which makes the restoration of the mosque so symbolic. It took 15 years to reconstruct. Craftsmen employed 16th century techniques and recovered 75 percent of the original masonry that had been discarded in city dumps and in nearby lakes.</p>\n<p><strong>OSMAN KOZLIC</strong>, Imam, Ferhadija Mosque: This is one of the most beautiful mosques in Balkan, not just in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: Osman Kozlic is the imam of this World Heritage Site.</p>\n<p>What is your message specifically to the Serbs in terms of reconciliation and trying to move on?</p>\n<p><strong>OSMAN KOZLIC</strong>: Our mosques, our cathedrals, our temples belong to all of them, belong to us. This is holy place, not only for me, as a Muslim, but it&#8217;s holy place for Catholics, for Orthodox Serbs. And if we are &#8212; think in that way, we have a good future.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: The mosque has special meaning for 21-year-old Emir Galijasevic, even though he was born just a year before the war ended. His family came from Banja Luka and were among those driven out during the ethnic cleansing.</p>\n<p><strong>EMIR GALIJASEVIC</strong>, Son of Muslim Wartime Refugees: All the criminals who had done bad things in the war had to be going from the court. But I still think people can still live together. We can still be friends and work together and be as a mirror to other place in Europe, that multiculturalism can live, and it&#8217;s, I think, the best example of this is this mosque in this town.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: But segregation has been exacerbated by economic stagnation. On both sides of the tangible partition, unemployment is sky-high, especially among the young. When part of Yugoslavia, this region was reasonably productive. Now it&#8217;s anything but.</p>\n<p>Potential investors are frightened away by corruption and political uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Pero Slavnic, a former major in the Bosnian Serb army, is campaigning for better benefits and pensions for military veterans. Financial hardship contributed to his divorce. Three of his sons are unemployed. And he is weary of politicians manipulating public opinion.</p>\n<p><strong>PERO SLAVNIC</strong>, Bosnian Serb Veterans&#8217; Representative (through interpreter): I think we are now further away from being together without borders than just after the war. When foundations are flawed, you become skeptical about everything, including the hand that reaches for you from the other side. We are constantly asking, is this an honest hand? We have a lot of problems in the area of trust.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: This would have been the perfect occasion for the Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, to address the issue of reconciliation. Of all the dignitaries present, his words would have carried most significant, because, after all, for many Muslims, Banja Luka represents the lion&#8217;s den.</p>\n<p>He was due to make a keynote speech, but he clearly didn&#8217;t like the tone of this event and elected not to speak. So, to find out what he thought, we headed past the glittering Serb Orthodox church to the presidential palace of the Serb Republic.</p>\n<p><strong>MILORAD DODIK</strong>, President, Republika Srpska\u00a0(through interpreter): I am sorry that Ferhadija was destroyed. But since then, we were the ones to support its reconstruction. Evil times happen. But people can&#8217;t choose those times. We were born in that period.</p>\n<p>But what we can do is to ensure that we don&#8217;t behave in an inhumane way. Regardless of our religion, nationality and ideology, we shouldn&#8217;t harm each other.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: But former Austrian diplomat Valentin Inzko is skeptical. He&#8217;s responsible for the civilian implementation of the Dayton peace accord and is concerned that Dodik&#8217;s threat to secede from Bosnia is poisoning the atmosphere.</p>\n<p><strong>VALENTIN INZKO</strong>, High Representative of Bosnia Herzegovina: There&#8217;s some mixed signals. For example, he gave some money for this renovated mosque. On the other side, the refugee return is many times not so easy. People have problems with papers, et cetera. In schools, they don&#8217;t &#8212; they&#8217;re not allowed them to speak their own language.</p>\n<p>He invented a different name for the Bosnian language and so on. So we have to measure him on the ground, in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: This student dormitory in the wartime Bosnian Serb capital Pale, a short distance from Sarajevo, is the most current source of Inzko&#8217;s concerns. It was named in honor of the wartime leader Radovan Karadzic, just as he was being sentenced in late March to 40 years imprisonment for crimes against humanity and genocide.</p>\n<p><strong>VALENTIN INZKO</strong>: Imagine in our country, we would have such dormitories glorifying Nazi people, et cetera. It&#8217;s totally unacceptable and this is really something where Mr. Dodik has crossed a red line.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: In Sarajevo, besieged for three years during the war, Professor Muhamed Hamidovic is a symbol of reconciliation. His wife was killed by a Serb mortar fired from the surrounding hills. He led the reconstruction of the Banja Luka mosque, but he too is disillusioned.</p>\n<p><strong>PROF. MUHAMED HAMIDOVIC</strong>\u00a0(through interpreter): We are still living in the past. We need a new global system. We need a new approach for young people. The current situation is horrible. I have a son who doesn&#8217;t know where to go or what to do. For five years, he&#8217;s unemployed. That&#8217;s a tragedy. We&#8217;re talking about reconciliation, and that&#8217;s so abstract to me.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: Back in Pale, Radovan Karadzic&#8217;s old stomping ground, three young students are weary of the lack of hope, and of being tainted by the Serb wartime legacy that has nothing to do them.</p>\n<p><strong>ANOJELA BOROVCANIN</strong>, Bosnian Serb Law Student: It is really pointless to make some differences because people, because we are all made of bones and blood. And we are all here for some reason. We are here to live, and we are here to love, and we are here to improve this world.</p>\n<p><strong>NENAD SAVIC</strong>, Bosnian Serb Law Student: Bosnia-Herzegovina is a place with too many fights between people.</p>\n<p><strong>NENAD SAVIC</strong>, Bosnian Serb Law Student: They were affected by everything that happened here a long time ago and people think &#8212; still cannot let it go. And that kind of depressing. And there is like no opportunity. When you go somewhere else, you see all those opportunities, and what can you actually do and what you cannot do here in my country.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: If the Ferhadija Mosque is to be a component in breaking down the barriers, Western officials believe more Muslims need to pluck up the courage to return to their former homes in what is still the Serb heartland.</p>\n<p>But the Serbs also need to offer genuine guarantees. Ordinary people on either side are forging bonds. But it&#8217;s widely accepted that politicians are getting in the way.</p>\n<p>For the &#8220;PBS NewsHour,&#8221; I&#8217;m Malcolm Brabant in Banja Luka.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/a-historic-bosnia-mosque-is-rebuilt-in-powerful-symbol-of-post-war-reconciliation/\">A historic Bosnia mosque is rebuilt in powerful symbol of post-war reconciliation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe class='partnerPlayer' frameborder='0' marginwidth='0' marginheight='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' src='http://player.pbs.org/widget/partnerplayer/2365750140/?start=0&end=0&chapterbar=false&endscreen=false' allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: The nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina remains bitterly divided more than 20 years after a vicious civil war.

We are here to live, and we are here to love, and we are here to improve this world.</p>\n<p><strong>NENAD SAVIC</strong>, Bosnian Serb Law Student: Bosnia-Herzegovina is a place with too many fights between people.</p>\n<p><strong>NENAD SAVIC</strong>, Bosnian Serb Law Student: They were affected by everything that happened here a long time ago and people think &#8212; still cannot let it go. And that kind of depressing. And there is like no opportunity. When you go somewhere else, you see all those opportunities, and what can you actually do and what you cannot do here in my country.</p>\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT</strong>: If the Ferhadija Mosque is to be a component in breaking down the barriers, Western officials believe more Muslims need to pluck up the courage to return to their former homes in what is still the Serb heartland.</p>\n<p>But the Serbs also need to offer genuine guarantees. Ordinary people on either side are forging bonds. But it&#8217;s widely accepted that politicians are getting in the way.</p>\n<p>For the &#8220;PBS NewsHour,&#8221; I&#8217;m Malcolm Brabant in Banja Luka.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/a-historic-bosnia-mosque-is-rebuilt-in-powerful-symbol-of-post-war-reconciliation/\">A historic Bosnia mosque is rebuilt in powerful symbol of post-war reconciliation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NewshourWorld/~4/k-xucoZU1lE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\t\r\n\r\n\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/a-historic-bosnia-mosque-is-rebuilt-in-powerful-symbol-of-post-war-reconciliation/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160509_AhistoricBosnia.mp3\" length=\"5242880\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" /> <itunes:duration>9:18</itunes:duration> <itunes:summary>Twenty years ago, the vicious civil war in Bosnia between Orthodox Serbs and Muslim Bosnians left more than 100,000 dead, and the country remains segregated along religious and ethnic lines to this day. Now, both sides are taking steps toward reconciliation with the rebuilding of a historic mosque in Serbian Bosnia, but skepticism abounds. Special correspondent Malcolm Brabant reports.\r\n</itunes:summary>\t<media:content url=\"http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/serbia2-1024x570.jpg\" medium=\"image\" />\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/a-historic-bosnia-mosque-is-rebuilt-in-powerful-symbol-of-post-war-reconciliation/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t</channel>\r\n</rss><!-- Performance optimized by W3 Total Cache.
