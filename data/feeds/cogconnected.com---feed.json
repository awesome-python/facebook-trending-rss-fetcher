According to NPD data, consumers spent $509.5 million on new game-related products at retailers in the United States last month. That is down 15 percent year-over-year from $598.1 million. Also, April saw a decline in both software and hardware sales. Only accessories, which includes interactive toys such as Nintendo\u2019s Amiibo, Skylanders and the now defunct <a href=\"http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/disney-infinity-cancelled/\">Disney Infinity</a>, saw any growth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dark_Souls_3_Screen_4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-116651 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dark_Souls_3_Screen_4-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"Dark Souls 3 patch 1.04\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" /></a></p>\n<p>Take a look at the top 10 list from last months NPD data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dark Souls 3 (PS4, Xbox One)</li>\n<li>Ratchet &amp; Clank 2016 (PS4)</li>\n<li>MLB 16: The Show (PS4, PS3)</li>\n<li>Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division (PS4, Xbox One, PC)</li>\n<li>Grand Theft Auto V (PS4, Xbox One, 360, PS3, PC)</li>\n<li>Minecraft (Xbox One, 360, PS4, PS3)</li>\n<li>Quantum Break (Xbox One)</li>\n<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops III (Xbox One, PS4, 360, PS3, PC)</li>\n<li>NBA 2K16 (PS4, Xbox One, 360, PS3)</li>\n<li>Star Fox: Zero (Wii U)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is no question <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z9LUDX4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00Z9LUDX4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=cogc-20&amp;linkId=MXCBS6WGH2S5HG4K\" target=\"_blank\">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> is the shocking surprise here.

Sales for Dark Souls 3 nearly doubled that of its predecessor, Dark Souls 2</p>\n<p>Other noteworthy releases for April include time-bending action game Quantum Break, which didn&#8217;t exactly live up to expectations. It was the top Xbox One exclusive, but it could not outperform PS4&#8217;s Ratchet &amp; Clank.</p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">\namzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_enable_interest_ads = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"cogc-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"auto\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"70fe59b24f6d2ec0490ec2aa700bf1fd\";\namzn_assoc_emphasize_categories = \"165793011,468642\";\n</script><br />\n<script src=\"//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US\"></script></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/05/12/april-2016-npd-dark-souls-iii-ratchet-clank-lead-as-gaming-industry-drops-15/\" target=\"_blank\">SOURCE</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/dark-souls-3-tops-npd-list/\">Dark Souls 3 Tops NPD List as Best Selling Game in April, Top 10 List Revealed</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com\">COGconnected</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/dark-souls-3-tops-npd-list/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Gran Turismo Sport Footage Coming May 19th</title>\n\t\t<link>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/gran-turismo-sport-footage-drops-may-19th/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/gran-turismo-sport-footage-drops-may-19th/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:01:33 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[COG News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[gran turismo]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[GT: Sport]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[PS4]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sony]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://cogconnected.com/?p=119684</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Fans of one of the most popular series in the racing genre can expect a juicy bit of information on Gran Turismo: Sport, as well as live footage of the title!

While the changes may not be as sweeping as we have seen in the past, Madden NFL 16 feels like the most complete Madden I have played in well over 10-years. I cannot recall a time where I wanted to play every single mode offered in the game over and over. That is the case this year. The new addition of Draft Champions is a delight and CFM and MUT continue to shine. There remains plenty of room for improvement, but there is no question the franchise has moved closer to a more authentic, true to life NFL experience.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Stay tuned here for full coverage of the game as more details come out!</p>\n<p>Source: Press Release</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/rob-gronkowski-madden-nfl-17-cover/\">New England Patriots Rob Gronkowski is the Official Madden NFL 17 Cover Athlete</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com\">COGconnected</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/rob-gronkowski-madden-nfl-17-cover/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Hunt Is On In XCOM 2&#8217;s Alien Hunters DLC</title>\n\t\t<link>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/the-hunt-is-on-in-xcom-2s-alien-hunters/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/the-hunt-is-on-in-xcom-2s-alien-hunters/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:02:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[COG News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Alien Hunters]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[firaxis]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[XCOM 2]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://cogconnected.com/?p=119677</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>For those who haven't killed enough aliens, XCOM 2 has just what the doctor ordered.

Expanding upon the popular title even further, players can expect one hell of a challenge as they will do battle with three new &#8220;Ruler&#8221; aliens, as well as a new, story focused mission. The threat isn&#8217;t just contained to that mission either though, as these three fearsome beasts can show up at random within your campaign, had you not concluded it yet. The rewards are well worth it, but this won&#8217;t be like taking candy from a baby.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These three ruler aliens server as the central point of a mission and XCOM 2: Alien Hunters as a whole. Humanity went a bit too far on the science front, letting these three nasty creatures loose into the world. The DLC smoothly meshes in with the main story, and the location is wholly original, sporting no sort of reskinned tiles, although there will be plenty of skinning going on as you hunt these aliens down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xcom2-alienhunters-insert.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-119680 size-full\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xcom2-alienhunters-insert.jpg\" alt=\"XCOM 2: Alien Hunters\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n<p>Aside from the satisfaction of killing these ruler aliens, you&#8217;ll also get to don their skin in some snazzy new pieces of Elite Armor that rightfully intimidate the enemy side, depending on which alien species they hail from. You&#8217;ll also get your hands on some new prototype weapons to help even the odds, but if you fall in battle, these items are lost for the rest of the playthrough. Firaxis assures us they are well worth the effort, so be sure to make use of your keenest strategies in order to secure this weaponry for mankind.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5_mr3TBZd_Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, these prototypes look rather antiquated in nature. The Bolt Caster does insane damage but has a one-round chamber, and the aptly named handcannon sports a polished wooden case and likely smells of rich mahogany. Smell is all aliens will have to go off of, as a successful kill with this beauty will conceal you right away, handy for keeping a soldier alive. It&#8217;s one classy killing tool, to say the least.</p>\n<p>XCOM 2: Alien Hunters is live as of writing, so head on over to the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/433090/\">Steam Store</a> page to get yourself ready to do a bit of big game hunting!

At the console launch, <em>Star Trek Online</em> will offer over six years\u2019 worth of content, including over 130 featured episodes that build upon classic Star Trek stories and series as they play alongside a cast of Star Trek actors including Jeri Ryan (Seven of Nine), Michael Dorn (Worf), Tim Russ (Tuvok) and more.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O_Ft7luIDn8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Star Trek Online</em> for consoles will bring two expansions and 11 seasons\u2019 worth of updates for players looking to immerse themselves in the world of Star Trek. Each player\u2019s adventure will begin as they choose from classic Star Trek factions including Federation, Klingon and Romulans, as well 32 species to customize their own Captain with millions of customization options available. While playing through content in Star Trek Online, players will be able to visit iconic locations including Vulcan, Deep Space Nine, Earth Space Dock and more.

Its last expansion, Star Trek Online: Delta Rising, brought players into the Delta Quadrant and reintroduced them to iconic members from the Star Trek: Voyager cast including Seven of Nine, The Doctor, Harry Kim, Neelix and Tuvok.

While it seems like Oculus Rift has gotten most of the attention, COG was recently invited to give the HTC Vive a whirl. After playing a handful of games on the VR device we think it deserves just a bit more attention. COG&#8217;s own Ahmed Mohamed tackled the world of HTC Vive VR, and we can safely say he was impressed.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mxDQycSyDg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>It was my first time using a virtual reality headset, and I came out both impressed and excited for what VR is now and what it can be in a few years. I got the chance to try out four titles while using the headset and the motion controllers with three base stations set up around the room to track motion.</p>\n<p>Starting off with an underwater experience called <em><a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/451520/\" target=\"_blank\">TheBlu: The Encounter</a></em>, I was standing on a derelict ship as schools of fish and stingrays floated by. The audio immersion surprisingly played a larger role than I thought, with the muffled sounds of the sea pouring into my ears. Although being my first time, I didn\u2019t have the surreal moment many have talked about when first trying a VR headset. That was until a skyscraper sized whale floated behind me, and I turned around. At first I didn\u2019t react, until I analyzed just how lifelike and large it was. That\u2019s when I felt a little uneasy, the entire purpose of the whale, and started to understand the hype surrounding virtual reality. I can\u2019t imagine how nerve wracking a horror game experience would be with Vive VR due to the ridiculous level of immersion of the tracking, motion controls, headset, and headphones combination.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-119643\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HTC-Vive-TheBlu-700x358.jpg\" alt=\"HTC Vive TheBlu Encounter\" width=\"700\" height=\"358\" /></p>\n<p>The second title, created by Google, is called <em><a href=\"http://www.tiltbrush.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tilt Brush</a></em>. The demo puts you in a space &#8211; and you can change the setting \u2013 and simply lets you move the motion controllers around to create art. This is the demo that truly exhibits what is essentially one-to-one movement. I tried hard to focus and could discern no input lag in my bodily actions translating to what was happening in the VR space. It\u2019s cool to draw in front of you, but it was even more impressive when I swooped over my head while holding the trigger. I could duck below the paint I was drawing with, as well as analyze the 3D art from every angle by simply walking around the space. The nature of the 3D environments and the motion tracking allow for this type of experience and HTC might have the upper hand to its competitors in that department. There are several options within <em>Tilt Brush</em> like the ability to change the color of your brush and its material, the environment you are standing in, and visual effects among other things.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TckqNdrdbgk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I moved on to a VR shoot \u2018em up called <em>The Lab: Xortex</em>. I was tasked with firing projectiles at robotic enemies while dodging their shots by ducking or moving aside. There was a tactical nature to both focusing on enemy spawns and making sure not to get hit, as one shot means game over. In virtual reality the stakes are higher, as enemies can spawn outside of your peripheral view, forcing you to physically move your head and actually look around on every axis. And in that is where virtual reality can evolve what we know as gameplay. Focusing on what makes it unique, meaning the tech itself, and using that to its advantage.</p>\n<p>Finally, the title that showcased every mechanic, was <em>Space Pirate Trainer</em>. It takes place in a 3D space on a tower overlooking a city wherein drone targets swoop up into view and fire at you. The twist is that the player can switch between a shield and a gun. You can dual wield 2 guns and hope to dodge bullets by moving your body, or, as I did, you can equip a shield on one hand and hold it up on one side while focusing fire on another drone. The game keeps track of your score as more and more waves of drones are sent your way.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-119646 size-medium\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HTC-Vive-space-700x393.jpg\" alt=\"HTC Vive Space Pirate Trainer\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" /></p>\n<p>Throughout my demo I was constantly reminded about how serious the VR initiative is. To re-iterate again, this is no gimmick. The HTC Vive delivers on what a virtual reality experience should feel, sound, and play like. How this translates to bigger and more prominent titles will be interesting, as well as how VR exclusive games utilize the technology to get the most out of it. While my current rig isn\u2019t powerful enough to run the HTC Vive, the tracking and motion controls advantage it has over its competitors is enticing and has me considering a new PC build. HTC may well succeed due to sheer quality but, as with the demos I tried, the games have to continue to capitalize on actually being in virtual reality.</p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">\namzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_enable_interest_ads = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"cogc-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"auto\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"7dad8f97bc2538ee0d2e1651635553bd\";\namzn_assoc_emphasize_categories = \"13900871,172282,5088769011,979455011,165793011,468642\";\n</script><br />\n<script src=\"//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US\"></script></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com/feature/hands-on-with-htc-vive/\">Hands-On with HTC Vive &#8211; More than Just the Oculus Rift&#8217;s Bastard Little Brother</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com\">COGconnected</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://cogconnected.com/feature/hands-on-with-htc-vive/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Learn To Draw Dozens of Disney and Pixar Characters In Disney Art Academy, Out Tomorrow</title>\n\t\t<link>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/disney-art-academy-out-tomorrow/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/disney-art-academy-out-tomorrow/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:11:34 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[COG News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Disney]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Disney Art Academy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Disney Infinity]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://cogconnected.com/?p=119642</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Disney Art Academy for the Nintendo 3DS Lets You Share Your Magical Creations on Social Media.

In the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BYKDOP2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01BYKDOP2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=cogc-20&amp;linkId=M4GBQCVSHCYPQSUG\" target=\"_blank\">Disney Art Academy</a>, launching exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems on May 13, you can use a wide variety of tools to learn to draw more than 80 Disney and Pixar characters in 2D.</p>\n<p>By setting your own pace through multiple easy-to-follow lessons, characters like Mickey Mouse, Nemo from Disney Pixar Finding Nemo, Elsa from Disney Frozen, Buzz Lightyear from Disney Pixar Toy Story and Simba from Disney The Lion King come to life on your Nintendo 3DS screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Disney_Art-Academy.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-119644 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Disney_Art-Academy-700x409.jpg\" alt=\"Disney Art Academy Featured Pic\" width=\"700\" height=\"409\" /></a></p>\n<p>In Disney Art Academy, Disney and Pixar characters can be sketched or painted in many different ways. Using nine art tools like pastels, paintbrushes or markers, you can discover your inner artist by participating in lessons inspired by Disney art and animation. These art lessons are absolutely intuitive and, most importantly, fun! Each lesson guides you through a step-by-step progression to draw a single character. What starts as a series of lines and shapes will gradually evolve into a familiar character using your new art skills! If you ever want to take a break, lessons can easily be saved to continue from the same spot at a later time.</p>\n<p>You can even add some extra flair with the Magic Brush, a new addition to the Art Academy series. With the Magic Brush, magical additions like stars, bubbles, and glitter can be added to your masterpieces \u2013 all easily accessed by using the touch screen on Nintendo 3DS.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M72ci80NYxQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>As your art skills improve and you create more and more Disney and Pixar characters, you may very well want to share your creations with others. That can easily be accomplished directly in the game by connecting to the Internet and sharing through Miiverse or social media via Image Share. Completed artwork is also saved to the Nintendo 3DS system\u2019s SD card, allowing you to upload your creations to a personal computer and print them out. Refrigerators around the country are about to get a lot more colourful (and a lot more magical!) once families start printing their favourite drawings.</p>\n<p>If you want to create outside the game\u2019s numerous lessons you\u2019re in luck, as Disney Art Academy includes a Free Paint mode that lets you draw even more characters any way you choose. In Free Paint, you can put your newly learned skills to the test by drawing on a blank canvas, or you can select from more than 80 Disney images to use as reference as you add to your virtual gallery. All completed artwork can be viewed at any time in the game\u2019s Clubhouse, where you can also select your favourite pieces to be viewed in a personal showcase slideshow.</p>\n<p>Disney Art Academy launches on May 13, and can be purchased in stores, in Nintendo eShop on Nintendo 3DS and at Nintendo.ca at a suggested retail price of $39.99.</p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">\namzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_enable_interest_ads = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"cogc-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"auto\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"70fe59b24f6d2ec0490ec2aa700bf1fd\";\namzn_assoc_emphasize_categories = \"165793011,468642\";\n</script><br />\n<script src=\"//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US\"></script></p>\n<p>Source: Press Release</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/disney-art-academy-out-tomorrow/\">Learn To Draw Dozens of Disney and Pixar Characters In Disney Art Academy, Out Tomorrow</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com\">COGconnected</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/disney-art-academy-out-tomorrow/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Mortal Kombat X for Mobile Gets a Massive Update As It Celebrates First Anniversary</title>\n\t\t<link>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/mortal-kombat-x-for-mobile-update/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/mortal-kombat-x-for-mobile-update/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:52:53 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[COG News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[street fighter]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://cogconnected.com/?p=119639</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Mortal Kombat X for mobile blends fighting and card collection for a whole new way to experience Mortal Kombat on mobile platforms.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/mortal-kombat-x-for-mobile-update/\">Mortal Kombat X for Mobile Gets a Massive Update As It Celebrates First Anniversary</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com\">COGconnected</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Mortal Kombat X for Mobile\u00a0Celebrates First Anniversary With Large Update</span></h2>\n<p>Warner Bros.

To do this, players have access to a 4&#215;4 panel system which can grow depending on the type and quality of the cauldron. As ingredients are placed into the cauldron, they will take up a set amount of tiles on the panel which, if utilized correctly, allows items to be more efficient than they normally are. A wide choice of recipes with different shape, size and quality can be used to craft items, and making full use of the panel space is vital to receiving optimal bonuses.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ecxMsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">On their journey, players will play as Sophie Neuenmuller, who runs an atelier in the town of Kirchen Bell. Joined by best friends Monika Ellmenreich and Oskar Behlmer, they begin a quest to learn new alchemy recipes and restore Plachta\u2019s missing memories. Along the way, they also meet Julio Sebald Leidenschaft, a young knight from the country of Adalett, who\u2019s investigating alchemy for unknown reasons, and Fritz Weissberg, an ex-mercenary &#8211; now puppeteer &#8211; who is skilled with the ways of the sword.</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"ecxMsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A diverse cast of townspeople are also on hand to help Sophie and her friends with their adventuring needs.

Corneria, a girl with the unique ability to duplicate items, runs a mass production shop. Harol Simens is the local clock shop owner, and while he can be sarcastic and harsh, he\u2019s in fact a caring and helpful fellow. Leon is a travelling clothier, proud of her talents at making charming clothes. Horst Basler runs the caf\u00e9 and will serve as Sophie\u2019s eyes and ears, as he is well-versed in the latest information around town.

Don the mantle of one of many history&#8217;s greatest leader, as you carve your own path from the beginning of time, all the way into the future. This is a series that should require no introduction, but for those who aren&#8217;t familiar with it, prepare for many a sleepless night to begin being experienced. Civilization is notorious for it&#8217;s addictive gameplay, and its a common case where people like to eke out &#8220;just one more turn&#8221; in order to see if they end up wiping out a rival civilization, or securing a key Wonder or Technology for themselves. Before you know it, 8 PM turns to 2 AM, and you&#8217;re having an absolute blast.\u00a0The series isn&#8217;t proposing any massive changes, and that&#8217;s reassuring, due to the mixed bag of reception that Beyond Earth had received. It&#8217;s exciting to see them returning to what works best, and while there will be no huge innovations, there will still be enhancements to the gameplay that will make it feel like the next step in the series. Lead Producer Dennis Shirk summarized their plans for design as &#8220;It&#8217;ll be like a warm blanket.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Civ-VI-Insert.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-119597\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Civ-VI-Insert.jpg\" alt=\"Civilization VI\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n<p>Naturally, Firaxis is keeping mum on the other proposed changes to Civilization VI, but there were a few key details they were able to bring up. Cities are getting a massive overhaul, and now will be spanning multiple tiles versus a single, cramped one. Placement is going to matter more than ever, \u00a0as you&#8217;ll have to create and manage Districts within your city, each dedicated to various outputs of a city. Production, Research, Finances, Military Power and Culture will all have their own depth, and it sounds like the locations that we place cities are also going to factor into how we research technologies.\u00a0It&#8217;s a very interesting change to the way the game will be played, and Firaxis is quite keen on making location an important factor in Civilization VI.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qvBf6WBatk0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Another giant change to the formula is what&#8217;s being touted as &#8220;dynamic diplomacy&#8221;. Similar to how Gandhi gained a penchant for nukes, AI will feel more organic in the game. The motivations of your competition will change wildly over the course of the game, trying to adapt to what works best to help work around (or conquer) others. Andrew Garrett, Lead AI Designer has also noted that &#8220;Each leader has a historical agenda that\u2019s associated with them, that reflects in some way who they were in history,&#8221; which should prove to be quite intriguing from a gameplay standpoint. Each AI&#8217;s behaviour will influence what they aim to develop, and we&#8217;d wholly expect the wonder-crazed Ramses to become even more fond of them, and taking major offense at you building ones before he would.</p>\n<p>Now begins the long, long wait for this title to actually release, but rest assured, Firaxis is aiming to make Civilization VI a big title, especially due to Beyond Earth. More information will be coming in the following months, so stay tuned to COG Connected for all the meaty details!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Source: Press Release</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/civilization-vi-coming-october-21-2016/\">Civilization VI Coming October 21, 2016</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com\">COGconnected</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/civilization-vi-coming-october-21-2016/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>All Rise!

What immediately caught my eye in this Studio MONO developed game\u00a0was its beautifully crafted environments and atmosphere of a space station on a 400 year journey to find a new home. The prologue areas oozed with character and style and reminded me of <em>Bioshock</em>\u2019s iconic Rapture setting. But the games influences don\u2019t stop there as a lot of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YQ1NOPM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00YQ1NOPM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=cogc-20&amp;linkId=42OK4OLLJF3D2MGU\" target=\"_blank\">Fallout</a></em> can be gleaned as I scrapped through metal and other materials while crafting new items. <em>InSomnia</em> has a real maturity to it even in its storytelling which also mimics the older Fallout titles and really gives off the classic sci-fi adventure feel, which is compounded further with its isometric perspective.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2rEWaLjTco?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The narrative can be a bit overwhelming as the developers throw a lot at you to begin with, but the world and some of its inhabitants are so interesting that I did not mind. As the story goes, the ship is heading towards the \u2018Evacuation Point\u2019 where mankind hopes to start over again. The developer has expressed their inspiration for the narrative coming from World War documentaries, and the game includes references to historic characters. On the environmental side, I can only describe it as a futuristic Wasteland in its world-building and locales. Even more so, the game&#8217;s ambient noise and stellar musical score further immerse you in the experience as you travel through dark hallways and mess halls, accompanied by striking tunes and the roar of the ship. Exploration is also a large part of the game, as you stumble upon preachers surrounded by followers, dark rooms in the corners of the ship, and new characters to interact with. The game boasts an appealing lighting system \u2013 which comes as no surprise as the game runs on Unreal Engine 4 &#8211; and the classic look of the character models fit in with the world and the story.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-118869 size-medium\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/InSomnia-Top-Screen-700x429.jpg\" alt=\"InSomnia Preview Screen 01 Priest\" width=\"700\" height=\"429\" /></p>\n<p>On the gameplay side, its real-time nature paired with the isometric view is refreshing in an era where modern sensibilities trump all. I particularly enjoyed the weapon combat and aiming system as its tactical approach can open up gameplay possibilities and how you approach targets. Players also have the ability to melee \u2013 both a standard and strong attack-, but must watch out for the stamina bar shown on the HUD. Interestingly, a sprint ability is thrown in, although I didn\u2019t see much use of it as most areas were close-quarters or packed with loot-able objects. Crafting also plays a vital role and players can find new items and upgrade parts \u2013 as well as character abilities and stats \u2013 as you uncover more of the space station. The tactical nature of the gameplay and planning works well here and the controls are solid for the most part besides getting used to the movement system initially. In this prologue demo, there were a few graphical hiccups that effected my play experience, although the full game should be a more polished version.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-119587\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/InSomnia-screen-700x428.jpg\" alt=\"InSomnia Preview Screen\" width=\"700\" height=\"428\" /></p>\n<p><em>InSomnia</em> delivers in the potential of its storytelling with interesting characters littering the atmospheric space station on its way to human salvation. I enjoyed the gameplay experience more than I thought I would, particularly the decision to go with an isometric view. But it is in its superbly crafted environments and spot on musical score that makes it worth trying out. It looks and sounds authentic, and this helps with making its narrative more believable and investing the player into the goings-on of the world. It also helps that its characters are fun to interact with via a Fallout-style dialogue system that fits in with the games old school look.

It&#8217;s usually the games that offer deep customization and intriguing end-game content that seem to suck me in. I had no trouble paying monthly for this kind of gaming experience, then along came <a href=\"http://cogconnected.com/2016/04/dc-universe-online-available-on-xbox-one/\">DC Universe Online</a> (DCUO) for the PS3 which not only satisfied every tick on my list of what I want in an MMO but here&#8217;s the cherry, it&#8217;s free-to-play. Once again, I became utterly consumed. Now, DC returns to grace the next-gen consoles, does it still hold up today? Well, I can tell you that it has definitely seen improvements from my time with it during the PS3 era but let\u2019s begin with a re-cap of what makes DCUO so damn good.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6MUtjliftVA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The story begins with your created hero breaking out of the leader of an alien army Brainiacs ship. This is the introduction to the mechanics along with a tutorial to get you off the ground (literally). As you fight your way out, Superman or Lex Luthor come to your rescue depending on if you&#8217;re a hero or villain. After destroying the ship you are brought to Gotham. Your mission is to clean up (or destroy) the streets of Metropolis and Gotham, deciding the fate of the cities \u2014 you know, just your average day in the life of a superhero.</p>\n<p>What I love about DC Universe Online is the vast array of customization features for your hero, sift through pages of options to choose size, face, skin type, costume and even swagger. Choose a famous hero/villain to be your mentor and they will be the one who issue quests and unlock a special perk tree. The character creator is so deep that you will unlikely run into anyone who looks the same \u2014 unless you decide to make Deadpool like many players have chosen to. Beyond cosmetics, you have a choice of one super power and weapon type, this is where the game&#8217;s replay value comes in. I&#8217;ve created about eight characters over my time with DCUO because there&#8217;s so much variety in how you can approach combat and the fighting style for each is fluid and fun, as you level up you can unlock further combos for your chosen weapon which opens up a collection of awesome ass-kickery.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">_____________________________</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><em><strong>&#8220;What I love about DC Universe Online is the vast array of customization features for your hero, sift through pages of options to choose size, face, skin type, costume and even swagger.&#8221;\u00a0</strong></em></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>DCUO accomplishes creating a healthy balance between PVP and PVE, if you&#8217;re not the type to battle other players during your travels you can switch phases to completely PVE. For those who like the extra slice of action, PVP is really well done, there&#8217;s times where a high-level villain will appear and it takes a bunch of low-level heroes to take him down this creates a sense of danger when going about your travels. The power and weapon combinations are surprisingly balanced so there&#8217;s no better way of fighting each other, just different play styles.</p>\n<p>One reason why we love MMOs is the grind, DCUO does follow the same format as your typical online games, mostly running around in an area, killing everything and looting a number of items to complete the quest. For some, it may be a turn-off, there needs to be a bit more in way of variety for the basic quest lines. I found way too many that required you to &#8220;kill 25 bad guys and loot 20 items&#8221; this is your standard MMO questing and it can become monotonous doing it over and over again in new zones. That&#8217;s a minor gripe though, there&#8217;s many solo or group instances, special events and your \u2018On Duty\u2019 tab which connects you to 1-8 player raids to keep things fresh \u2014 but the real game begins after you hit the level cap of 30. After maxing your level you open up a whole new list of episodes, instances and arenas to upgrade your characters stats and equipment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DCUO_Xb1_001-700x394.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-118728 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DCUO_Xb1_001-700x394-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"DC Universe Online\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" /></a></p>\n<p>DC Universe Online is set in Metropolis and Gotham and each city has a distinct look and vibe to it, Gotham is typically seedy and dark where Metropolis is more bright and vibrant. The game world is big and beautiful considering the amount of rendering going on with all the other heroes zipping through the skies. There is a lot of pop in textures, the world will often not load fast enough and will result in blocky environments and during peak hours, the servers can get extremely congested which results in long queues to start a game which also brings along the lag. When you complete a major quest line you will be rewarded with a cutscene featuring iconic DC characters and the voice acting does well to encapsulate the vibe of the villains or heroes that are portrayed. The music throughout the game feels like something you would hear in a vibrant world full of super powers, it enacts a sense of wonder as you fly around the skyscrapers of Metropolis.</p>\n<p>Now, if you\u2019re a veteran of DCUO and wondering what has changed since the original release? After patches, new content and costumes it almost seems like an entirely new game. Matchmaking used to be horrendous but it now takes seconds to enter a match, there\u2019s new super powers including \u2018munitions, rage, light and quantum, you can also now channel your inner Captain America and outfit your hero with a shield weapon. There\u2019s also a whole array of new outfits and pre-made character looks if you want to mimic your favourite DC characters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DCUO_Xb1_007-700x394.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-118734 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DCUO_Xb1_007-700x394-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"DC Universe Online\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" /></a></p>\n<p>By now, most of you can probably guess my recommendation on whether to try DC Universe Online. For those who are late to the party let me break it down. In DC Universe Online we have an MMO with endless customization options to create the hero or villain of your dreams, exciting end game content with eight player dungeons and Legendary PVP arenas. It has all of your favourite DC comic book stars sharing the world, you can fly, and last but not least it won&#8217;t cost you a dime \u2014 it&#8217;s a no brainer! If you&#8217;re a comic book fan and love MMO&#8217;s than this game will rock your world and then some.</p>\n<p><em>***An Xbox One code was provided by the publisher***</em></p>\n\n<a class=\"thumbnail img-thumbnail\" href='http://cogconnected.com/2016/04/dc-universe-online-available-on-xbox-one/dcuo_xb1_008-700x394/'><img width=\"500\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DCUO_Xb1_008-700x394-500x394.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"DC Universe Online\" /></a>\n<a class=\"thumbnail img-thumbnail\" href='http://cogconnected.com/2016/04/dc-universe-online-available-on-xbox-one/dcuo_xb1_006-700x394/'><img width=\"500\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DCUO_Xb1_006-700x394-500x394.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"DC Universe Online\" /></a>\n<a class=\"thumbnail img-thumbnail\" href='http://cogconnected.com/2016/04/dc-universe-online-available-on-xbox-one/dcuo_xb1_004-700x394/'><img width=\"500\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DCUO_Xb1_004-700x394-500x394.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"DC Universe Online\" /></a>\n<a class=\"thumbnail img-thumbnail\" href='http://cogconnected.com/2016/04/dc-universe-online-available-on-xbox-one/dcuo_xb1_003-700x394/'><img width=\"500\" height=\"394\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DCUO_Xb1_003-700x394-500x394.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"DC Universe Online\" /></a>\n\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">\namzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_enable_interest_ads = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"cogc-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"auto\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"70fe59b24f6d2ec0490ec2aa700bf1fd\";\namzn_assoc_emphasize_categories = \"165793011,468642\";\n</script><br />\n<script src=\"//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US\"></script></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com/review/dc-universe-online-review/\">DC Universe Online Review &#8211; Bats and Joker Duel it Out on the Xbox One</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com\">COGconnected</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://cogconnected.com/review/dc-universe-online-review/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>King&#8217;s Quest Chapter 3: Once Upon a Climb Review &#8211; This Season is Finally Finding its Foothold</title>\n\t\t<link>http://cogconnected.com/review/kings-quest-chapter-3-review/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://cogconnected.com/review/kings-quest-chapter-3-review/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 13:43:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicholas Plouffe]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Review]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[king's quest]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sierra Entertainment]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Odd Gentlemen]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://cogconnected.com/?post_type=review&#038;p=119561</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 3 in the new King's Quest series helps lift the season closer to its full potential with an endearing tale of love and acceptance.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com/review/kings-quest-chapter-3-review/\">King&#8217;s Quest Chapter 3: Once Upon a Climb Review &#8211; This Season is Finally Finding its Foothold</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com\">COGconnected</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">King&#8217;s Quest Chapter 3 Review</span></h2>\n<p>Once Upon a Climb is out, and I&#8217;ve gotta say, Chapter 3 really brought back my interest in the new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010O9XWO2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B010O9XWO2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=cogc-20&amp;linkId=CIQ4ZCGV3KPJ2NCC\" target=\"_blank\">King&#8217;s Quest</a>. Despite starting strong, Chapter 2 was a bit of a let down. It made me worry about the future of this classic franchise, but that worry is now replaced with a strong sense of hope.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3eQUNWFhnzo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>King Graham now has his castle and companions, but he is of course still missing his queen. Once Upon a Climb is all about finding his true love, and winning her over with bravery, wits, and a bit of awkward charm. There are some spoilers in the next paragraph to outline the plot of this chapter, so please feel free to skip ahead if you&#8217;d like to remain unaware.</p>\n<p>Graham finds himself lonely, eating dinner by himself in his enormous castle. The magic mirror shows him where he can find his soon-to-be queen, a tall tower in the woods, and he sets off at once. Of course, nothing is ever easy, and the tower is sealed shut, leading to an arduous climb to the top. Graham discovers a pair of sisters, and from here on out you have to be careful about your dialogue options if you know which sister you&#8217; like to court. Unfortunately, just when you think this is going to be easy, you discover that you&#8217;re all trapped within the tower by a magical spell and an old witch, Hagatha.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">______________________________</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">&#8220;One big change however, is there isn&#8217;t the same sense of doom or danger this time around.&#8221;</span></strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Chapter 3 still feels like King&#8217;s Quest, and so you can expect a lot of puns and comic relief. One big change however, is there isn&#8217;t the same sense of doom or danger this time around. Sure, there are some unsavoury characters and some obstacles to get past, but it&#8217;s not as frightening as being chased by a dragon or being locked up by goblins like in previous chapters. It was a nice change of pace that really brought it all back to a more charming situation, and I rather enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>There are still plenty of tense moments, especially near the climax, and the puzzles felt quite well-done this time around. They were a bit on the easy side, but instead of wishing for specific items, more frequently Graham is placed in front of standalone puzzles that can be completed without having to search through your bag and try every item. Pacing was great too, with puzzles, dialogue, and adventuring all being spaced out well enough so that you&#8217;ll never feel tired of one piece in particular.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KingsQuestChapter3-18.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-119566 size-medium\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KingsQuestChapter3-18-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"Kings-Quest-Chapter3-Insert1\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" /></a></p>\n<p>The only thing that feels like it&#8217;s missing this time around is more interaction with Graham and his grandchildren in the present. The few moments the story swaps timelines feel just sort of thrown in there, though I suppose for anyone that doesn&#8217;t really care about the kids all that much, this is probably a nice change. To be honest, if I had never become invested in them in the first place within the first couple chapters, Once Upon a Climb would probably be the best chapter yet.</p>\n<p>Epic scenery, funny dialogue, and some great reveals help push this chapter higher than Chapter 2, without being arbitrarily long or difficult. The Odd Gentlemen has definitely restored my faith in the possibilities of what is yet to come, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what happens in Chapter 4.</p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t looked into this new episodic take on a cult classic, you definitely should. King&#8217;s Quest is a great way to kill some time if you enjoy a more comedic point-and-click adventure like Monkey&#8217;s Island. Cook up some pancakes, grab a controller, and treat yourself to an enjoyable weekend morning with some laughter and fantasy as you help push Graham along on his quest.</p>\n<p><strong>*** PS4 code was supplied by the publisher ***</strong></p>\n\n<a class=\"thumbnail img-thumbnail\" href='http://cogconnected.com/review/kings-quest-chapter-3-review/kings-quest_20160505202059/'><img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KingsQuestChapter3-22-500x500.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Kings-Quest-Chapter3-insert2\" /></a>\n<a class=\"thumbnail img-thumbnail\" href='http://cogconnected.com/review/kings-quest-chapter-3-review/kings-quest_20160504205212/'><img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KingsQuestChapter3-18-500x500.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Kings-Quest-Chapter3-insert1\" /></a>\n<a class=\"thumbnail img-thumbnail\" href='http://cogconnected.com/review/kings-quest-chapter-3-review/kings-quest_20160504202014/'><img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KingsQuestChapter3-14-500x500.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Kings-Quest-Chapter3-insert3\" /></a>\n<a class=\"thumbnail img-thumbnail\" href='http://cogconnected.com/review/kings-quest-chapter-3-review/kings-quest_20160504200305/'><img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://cogconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KingsQuestChapter3-12-500x500.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Kings-Quest-Chapter3-insert4\" /></a>\n\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">\namzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_enable_interest_ads = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"cogc-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"auto\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"70fe59b24f6d2ec0490ec2aa700bf1fd\";\namzn_assoc_emphasize_categories = \"165793011,468642\";\n</script><br />\n<script src=\"//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US\"></script></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com/review/kings-quest-chapter-3-review/\">King&#8217;s Quest Chapter 3: Once Upon a Climb Review &#8211; This Season is Finally Finding its Foothold</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com\">COGconnected</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://cogconnected.com/review/kings-quest-chapter-3-review/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Star Wars Battlefront To Get a Sequel Next Year</title>\n\t\t<link>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/star-wars-battlefront-sequel/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/star-wars-battlefront-sequel/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 01:19:19 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[COG News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Star Wars]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Star Wars Battlefront]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://cogconnected.com/?p=119553</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>A Star Wars: Battlefront sequel is due next year according to report, while Amy Hennig's Star Wars game will follow in 2018. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com/2016/05/star-wars-battlefront-sequel/\">Star Wars Battlefront To Get a Sequel Next Year</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cogconnected.com\">COGconnected</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Star Wars Battlefront Sequel Coming Next Year</span></h2>\n<p>In what comes as a shock to fans and to us here at COGconnected,\u00a0EA confirmed today that there will be a sequel to Star Wars Battlefront as part of EA&#8217;s line-up next year.

However, EA reports it expects to release at least one Star Wars game per year &#8220;over the next 3 to 4 years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>EA also mentioned working with its &#8220;partners at Respawn&#8221; on another Star Wars game.\u00a0&#8220;They&#8217;re very excited about that.&#8221; EA believes Respawn could &#8220;add a huge amount&#8221; to a new Star Wars game.</p>\n<p>EA announced its financial results for the year today.
