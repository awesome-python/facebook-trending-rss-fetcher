He was clad in a Wu-Tang Clan T-shirt, jeans, and white socks and sandals. At his feet, James Baxter, Zayner\u2019s one-eyed orange cat, rubbed its flank against its owner\u2019s legs. The kitchen smelled like an outhouse in a busy campground.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next four days, Zayner would attempt to eradicate the trillions of microbes that lived on and inside his body \u2014 organisms that helped him digest food, produce vitamins and enzymes, and protected his body from other, more dangerous bacteria. Ruthlessly and methodically, he would try to render himself into a biological blank slate. Then, he would inoculate himself with a friend\u2019s microbes \u2014&amp;nbsp;a procedure he refers to as a \"microbiome transplant.\" Zayner imagines the collection of organisms that live on him \u2014 his microbiome \u2014 as a suit. As such, it can be worn, mended, and replaced. The suit he was living with, he said, was faulty, leaving him with severe gastrointestinal pain. A new suit could solve all that. \"You kind of are who you are, to a certain extent,\" he said. \"But with your bacteria, you can change that.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A full bacterial overhaul like this had never been documented before \u2014 in fact, it may have been the first time it had ever been attempted. There was no evidence to suggest it would work, though there was a real risk it could make Zayner life-threateningly sick. That didn\u2019t bother him.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Zayner unwrapped a brand-new syringe and filled its barrel with the brownish liquid. He grabbed one half of a gelatin capsule, pushed the syringe\u2019s plunger, and filled the capsule with the fecal slurry in inconsistent spurts. \"Undigested portions of the meal are clogging it,\" he said. Frustrated, he removed the needle and pushed the plunger again, letting clumpy muck accumulate in the half capsule. But by the time he joined both ends of the pill, the gelatin casing had begun deteriorating in his gloved hands. \"I think the liquid is dissolving these fucking capsules,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For a brief moment, Zayner considered throwing his head back and swallowing the feces straight up, like a shooter from hell. But the thought disgusted him, and instead he opened a kitchen drawer and grabbed an inoculating loop, an instrument used by microbiologists to sample microorganisms. He dipped it into the large, poop-filled Ziploc bag on the counter. \"We\u2019re going to try this new technique \u2014 the \u2018stuff and jam,\u2019\" he said. The unadulterated shit had a frosting-like texture and didn\u2019t eat through the gelatin; the pill held up. Exhausted from his most recent dose of antibiotics, Zayner took a break. Tomorrow, in a hotel room near the San Francisco International Airport, he planned to start his transformation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Microbiome pill\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRp5QDd7yg7lcEexvhqs4_UJeRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434435/vpavic_160217_1033_0015.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zayner is a punk:&lt;/strong&gt; his ears are adorned with a row of 10 piercings each, his body is covered in tattoos, and his dark mohawk is topped with a shock of bleached-blonde hair. The haircut, the piercings, and most of the tattoos he did himself. He doesn\u2019t trust others with these tasks, he says. This is a running theme in Zayner\u2019s life.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As a child, Zayner rarely saw doctors \u2014 his family, he says, was too poor to pay for visits. Then in college, he got health insurance and finally started going; gastrointestinal pain was making it hard for him to lead a normal life. He was pooping more than four times a day, and severe \"attacks\" forced him to isolate himself for hours. The doctors visits were expensive and ineffective, he says, and over time, Zayner grew suspicious of physicians. \"I\u2019ll take their advice if there\u2019s something I can\u2019t fix myself, but otherwise, if what they say goes against what I know, I\u2019m not going to necessarily believe them or trust them, right?\" he says.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s not to say Zayner is dubious of science \u2014 in fact, he\u2019s a scientist himself. In 2013, he earned a PhD in Biophysics from the University of Chicago and subsequently served as a postdoc researcher at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center for two years. But the space agency didn\u2019t suit him. \"NASA was not what I imagined it to be,\" he says. It was supposed to be a bastion of innovation, but the experiments he saw performed at NASA were underwhelming. \"[There\u2019s] very little work getting done, because people either don\u2019t work, don\u2019t care to work, or because the last time they did any science was 40 years ago,\" he says.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Microbiome portrait\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yvUrXhtXqP4Id1wCFe12X70BW_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434389/vpavic_160219_1033_0065.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So in January 2016, Zayner left Ames and turned his attention to two of his own projects: an &lt;a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/diy-crispr-kits-learn-modern-science-by-doing\"&gt;Indiegogo campaign&lt;/a&gt; aimed at providing people with CRISPR kits to alter bacterial DNA, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.the-odin.com/\"&gt;The ODIN&lt;/a&gt;, a business he started in grad school that sells scientific kits and instruments to people who\u2019d like to do experiments at home. Today, The ODIN has four employees who work out of Zayner\u2019s garage. Sustained by orders from schools and hobbyists, The ODIN is doing well, Zayner says: he expects the company\u2019s revenue to reach somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000 this year. On weekends he sometimes teaches free classes on genetic engineering in public lab spaces around San Francisco. In our conversations, Zayner stressed to me the importance of breaking science out of labs and classrooms and making it available to the wider public. \"I don\u2019t like titles,\" Zayner told me. \"But I generally refer to myself as a biohacker.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"I don\u2019t like titles,\" Zayner told me. \"But I generally refer to myself as a biohacker.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Leaving the world of conventional science made Zayner happy \u2014 and working from home was easier on his gut. Zayner generally has to defecate two to three times before starting his workday, and also after every meal. He claims to have ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome, but he\u2019s a bit hazy on the details of his diagnoses. When pressed, he admits that he doesn't remember what his physician told him in college \u2014 he could have IBS or inflammatory bowel disease. And a search through his medical records is inconclusive. \"I don\u2019t think I made it up or am remembering wrong, but who knows?\" he wrote me in a text.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But his physical distress \u2014 and his frustration with the medical treatment he received \u2014 was very real. So at 35, Zayner decided to dive into one of science\u2019s most foolhardy traditions: self-experimentation. Some of his predecessors have achieved great things. In 1984, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/marshall-bio.html\"&gt;Nobel winner Barry James Marshall&lt;/a&gt; ingested a species of bacteria to demonstrate their role in causing ulcers. He was, to his discomfort, proven correct. Other ventures have been less successful. In 1900, an American physician by the name of Jesse Lazear intentionally submitted himself to bites from yellow fever-infected mosquitoes in an effort to learn about the virus\u2019 transmission. He died. Three decades later, Russian physician Alexander Bogdanov performed multiple blood transfusions on himself to deduce whether the procedure would keep him eternally young. It didn\u2019t \u2014 the experiment killed him.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Microbiome kitchen wide\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emrcX4xf9qctNTCn69HBvfRDfek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434535/vpavic_160217_1033_0003.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Across cultures,&lt;/strong&gt; human feces are reviled. Shit stinks, yes, but that\u2019s not actually why it\u2019s gross \u2014 thanks to its bacterial load, it\u2019s a disease vector that causes outbreaks of cholera, typhoid fever, and &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. But humans didn\u2019t truly figure that out until the 19th century. So, for a long time, shit was actually used by some as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Ebers Papyrus, a document from Ancient Egypt dating back to 1500 BC, contains more than &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14708054\"&gt;50 prescriptions&lt;/a&gt; for medicines in which shit is the active ingredient. In the 4th century, a well-known traditional Chinese doctor described using &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ajg/journal/v107/n11/full/ajg2012251a.html\"&gt;a suspension of human feces&lt;/a&gt; to help patients with food poisoning or severe diarrhea. And in the 17th century, an Italian anatomist named Fabricius ab Aquapendente was using shit to treat gastrointestinal diseases &lt;a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2012.60\"&gt;in veterinary medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The first modern fecal matter transplant didn\u2019t take place &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/excrement-experiment\"&gt;until&lt;/a&gt; the mid-20th century. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13592638\"&gt;In 1958&lt;/a&gt;, an American surgeon named Ben Eiseman performed enemas on four pseudomembranous colitis patients. Eiseman suspected that a treatment of antibiotics had killed off natural gut bacteria, leading to severe cases of diarrhea. So, instead of flushing their colons with water alone, he used shit from healthy patients. Perhaps, he figured, reintroducing normal intestinal bacteria into the guts of patients whose digestive system had been wiped out would heal them. \"It seemed to work,\" Eiseman told author Mary Roach in a 2012 interview. \"It made a small splash.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"Sometimes patients can improve in a couple of hours.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The fecal enema didn\u2019t exactly come into fashion \u2014 over the next three decades, only a handful of trials were done. But by the late \u201880s, fecal matter transplants were increasingly recognized as a treatment for infections caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/em&gt; \u2014&amp;nbsp;infections that can cause colitis. And antibiotics, used more and more often in American health care, were triggering more and more cases of &lt;i&gt;C. diff&lt;/i&gt;. By 2011, &lt;i&gt;C. diff&lt;/i&gt; infections were killing &lt;a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0225-clostridium-difficile.html\"&gt;15,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; a year. Fecal matter transplants, or FMTs \u2014 the procedure that Egyptian and Chinese doctors used long before Eiseman \u2014&amp;nbsp;suddenly made a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Though enemas and nasal operations are still performed, the most publicized FMT procedure involves taking pills filled with the feces of another healthier individual. Because shit is considered a medicine when it\u2019s administered by a doctor, the procedure is &lt;a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Vaccines/ucm361379.htm\"&gt;strictly regulated by the US government&lt;/a&gt;, and is only available to patients with recurrent &lt;i&gt;C. diff&lt;/i&gt;. And in truth, the restriction has a lot do with the fact that scientists don\u2019t yet understand why the treatment works, or how it affects patients in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But evidence suggests the benefits can be great: the Mayo Clinic\u2019s campus in Phoenix reports that &lt;a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/clinical-updates/digestive-diseases/fmt-demonstrates-consistently-high-success-rates-for-recurrent-cdi\"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;C. diff&lt;/i&gt; patients who receive FMTs are cured of the infection. And the transplants can work fast. \"Sometimes patients can improve in a couple of hours,\" says Majdi Osman, a physician and the clinical program director at OpenBiome, a nonprofit that facilitates fecal transplants by screening donors and collecting their feces.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Microbiome poop \" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e00vHlqlN4wkvmODFLejAU5MXSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434395/vpavic_160217_1033_0023.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Zayner doesn\u2019t recall the first time he heard about FMTs \u2014 and he\u2019s never been diagnosed with &lt;i&gt;C. diff&lt;/i&gt;. But given his condition, replacing his gut bacteria sounded like a possible solution. The operation Zayner envisioned, however, would involve more than a simple fecal matter transplant; instead he would also alter the bacterial composition of his nose, mouth, arms, and skin \u2014 his entire exterior. He\u2019d been thinking about full-body microbiome transfers for a while: in August 2015 he made &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7bAHdpL5uA\"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; in which he imagines a future where police use scanners to identify people by their microbiome \u2014 a future where \"those who engineer themselves are persecuted and imprisoned,\" he told me.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Last November, I called Zayner to discuss his Indiegogo CRISPR kits and that\u2019s when he mentioned the transplant, which he described as \"kind of an art-science project.\" In the weeks that followed, I reached out to more than a dozen researchers who might be familiar with such an experiment. Eventually, a skin microbiome expert told me that the closest thing scientists had done in adults was to transfer bacteria &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19892944\"&gt;from one site of the body to another&lt;/a&gt;. In that instance, a bacterial transplant from the study participants\u2019 tongues to their forearms held up well eight hours later, but a transfer of tongue bacteria to participants\u2019 foreheads didn\u2019t. The researchers obtained similar results when they attempted the same, small transfers between different volunteers. Other research has been done on inoculating children born through C-section with their mothers\u2019 vaginal bacteria. But I found no mention of an adult ever trying to kill all the bacteria on their skin in order to permanently replace them with that of another human being.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every single professional stressed that Zayner\u2019s experiment could make him very sick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The lack of precedent meant that few experts were willing to discuss the bacterial skin transfer Zayner was suggesting. One biologist did agree to talk \u2014 and she wasn\u2019t impressed. \"I think that\u2019s sort of pie in the sky,\" said Elizabeth Hohmann, a fecal transplant expert at Harvard University. Changing the skin\u2019s microbiome is \"not as simple as coating yourself in some antibiotics and then putting a [bacterial] swab on&amp;nbsp;\u2014&amp;nbsp;that\u2019s just ridiculous.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Researchers were even less enthusiastic about the fecal transplant. Of the nine biology and medical professionals I spoke with, every single one stressed that Zayner\u2019s experiment could make him very sick. Zayner vowed not to analyze his donor\u2019s feces \u2014 it contradicted, he said, the DIY ethos of the experiment and could make the project seem less accessible to laypeople. As a result, he was putting himself at risk for hepatitis, rotavirus, and a whole slew of other pathogens and parasites. And his decision to take antibiotics to kill his own bacteria before the transplant was risky, said OpenBiome\u2019s Osman. Some people carry &lt;i&gt;C. diff&lt;/i&gt; without any symptoms; if Zayner was one those people, disrupting the balance in his gut could enable &lt;i&gt;C. diff&lt;/i&gt; to flourish \u2014 and the consequences of that could be life-threatening. \"We actually advise patients to stop antibiotics before they have a fecal matter transplant, if possible,\" said Osman.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There was another thing that all the experts agreed on: the chances that Zayner would experience any benefit from the transplant were essentially zero. \"We don\u2019t have any evidence whatsoever that fecal microbiota transplantation helps cure other diseases,\" says Sahil Khanna, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic. Hohmann added that Zayner\u2019s experiment was ultimately \"na\u00efve and poorly advised \u2014 on several levels.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"microbiome hotel portrait\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zmkd4cn8pgIZjDZvJ3r_S3dAcQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434401/vpavic_160219_1033_0060.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For months,&lt;/strong&gt; Zayner mulled over the experiment. Then, at the end of January, he booked three nights at a hotel just south of the San Francisco Airport. The Crowne Plaza sits along Highway 101, the artery that shuttles tech workers back and forth between San Francisco and Silicon Valley. The hotel is a dated and dreary place, decorated in a depressing blend of beiges and browns.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A hotel room is not a sterile environment for the sort of operation Zayner envisioned, but it was better than his home, where traces of his microbiome could be found in his sheets, his bathroom, his kitchen, his front doorknob. Zayner\u2019s next challenge was finding a donor. Everyone he\u2019d spoken to had either turned him down or backed out citing the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"If I end up in the hospital, it\u2019s okay; if I end up sick, it\u2019s okay.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A few days before the scheduled procedure, he finally convinced someone to participate: Michael (not his real name), a friend from college who Zayner hadn\u2019t seen in 10 years. Michael knew people with gastrointestinal tract problems, and he thought Zayner\u2019s experiment could help him. So Michael agreed to poop in a Ziploc bag, and have the skin on his arms, legs, the inside of nose, and his mouth swabbed twice. If the experiment worked, Zayner and Michael would share a unique and very personal biological bond.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fecal matter donors typically undergo a rigorous screening process, says Mark Smith, director of OpenBiome. \"Less than 3 percent of all of the donors that we screen end up qualifying as donors.\" When I reminded Zayner of the dangers involved, he insisted the experiment was worth it. \"That\u2019s the risk I need to be able to take to inspire people to take their health in their own hands,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Comments like these took me aback: they demonstrated the intricate ethical acrobatics Zayner was continuously performing. He was convinced that carrying out a risky and unproven procedure \u2014 using himself as a human guinea pig \u2014 and then publicizing it, could help others. To a skeptic like myself, Zayner\u2019s good intentions came across as misguided.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Would he feel responsible if someone repeated his experiment and fell ill? \"No, not at all,\" he said without hesitation. He had calculated the risks and benefits of his experiment \u2014 \"If I end up in the hospital, it\u2019s okay; if I end up sick, it\u2019s okay\" \u2014 and anyone following in his footsteps was responsible for doing the same. \"I\u2019m not your parent or government to regulate you; do what you want with your body.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"microbiome hotel wide\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oCgHO2a6t9_ltFwaeZFlwCQ5evo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434541/vpavic_160218_1033_0031.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At 3PM on&lt;/strong&gt; a Thursday in mid-February \u2014 day one of his procedure \u2014 Josiah Zayner stood in the middle of his hotel room, stripping down to his boxer briefs. He donned a yellow, disposable isolation gown and blue shoe covers. He handed me a set as well, which I immediately put on.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;   &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"shower 1\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OuiXKZNcsGtZ7j6Qxtl4FxufZzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434551/vpavic_160218_1033_0039.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n   &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"microbiome shower 2\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRgyuxCA-IBWesnWU6AzX6Fp8ps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434555/vpavic_160218_1033_0040.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n   &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"microbiome shower 3\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zIRRkkvmpIzCo6Dtye-7jMzqxYI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434559/vpavic_160218_1033_0038.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n &lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Zayner\u2019s first task was to turn the hotel room into a sterile containment field. Thousands of travelers have passed through here: pilots and flight attendants from all over the world, snotty children, flu-ridden businessmen \u2014 not to mention countless employees. At one point or another, their microbiomes had colonized this space. Zayner stripped the beds, replacing the sheets with ones he bought from Amazon specifically for this purpose. Then, he grabbed a container of Clorox Wipes and silently disinfected every surface of the room he was likely to touch.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His experimental protocol was self-designed. There were five main steps, two of which he\u2019d already started: taking samples of his skin microbiome and feces for a later analysis; and ingesting a two-day regimen of antibiotics he\u2019d purchased on Alibaba and eBay and verified for effectiveness. Then Zayner would try to rid himself of the bacteria on his body by cleaning his skin with powdered tetracycline, an antibiotic he would also dissolve and use to clean his nostrils and mouth. \"Rubbing your skin with tetracycline powder is not going to sterilize it,\" Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist at Stanford University, told me. \"There is no way to sterilize your skin. Any attempt at complete sterilization of a person\u2019s skin will most likely kill a person first before they are sterile.\" Once clean, Zayner would proceed to the actual transplant: swallowing poop pills, and applying a saline solution filled with Michael\u2019s skin bacteria to his nose, mouth, arms, and legs. Later, he would sample his skin and fecal matter again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. Zayner had been on a digestive rollercoaster since he began the antibiotic regimen, but that was expected. He was tired and in pain. The drugs gave him cramps, in addition to \"explosive poops,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With the room disinfected to his liking, Zayner jumped into the shower to begin scrubbing off his microbiome. As he applied the antibiotic with a kitchen sponge, his pale white skin turned an angry red; he was scrubbing hard. After, he filled a Neti Pot with the same antibiotic liquid and flushed out his nasal passages over the sink \u2014&amp;nbsp;a process that involved hacking up prodigious amounts of yellowish saliva.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t help but notice Zayner cutting corners. After drying off, he put on a brand-new Hanes white T-shirt to prevent his old microbiome from recolonizing his body, but an old \u2014 though freshly laundered \u2014 pair of jeans. He sampled his arms, nose, and mouth, but he didn\u2019t bother to take microbial samples from his genitalia, and didn\u2019t plan on applying Michael\u2019s skin bacteria to his penis or testicles. He told me that there just isn\u2019t much scientific value in gathering that information. Over the course of his experiment, Zayner would only take a third of the poop pills that someone undergoing a standard FMT procedure would, stretched over a longer period of time. When I confronted Zayner about my observations, he was either dismissive, or unaware of a standard FMT protocol.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Scrubbed raw, at around 5PM, Zayner began the transplant. He put on blue gloves, grabbed a glass of water and took a plastic bag filled with poop pills out of the fridge. He was nervous. \"You start thinking about like \u2018Wow, why do animals eat their own poop or eat other animals\u2019 poop?\u2019 And like, what really are we so scared about with feces?\" he\u2019d told me the day before, rationalizing the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;   &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Microbiome series 2-1\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lm-9YqhLlyxw_Qi_dz7B8_4zsY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434953/vpavic_160219_1033_0052__1_.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n   &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Microbiome series 2\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31DMbMRqK6bd3hth_2z_WpJ27DE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434991/vpavic_160219_1033_0055.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n   &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"microbiome series 2 3\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rFxXUfs31KrjwSSNeK9B_5Yms3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434993/vpavic_160219_1033_0046__1_.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n   &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"microbiome series 2 4\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yGmmHIrZHQl5BtyQ0tuGO95-1Vo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434995/vpavic_160219_1033_0049.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n &lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Zayner looked like he was enjoying himself. The thrill of the experiment \u2014&amp;nbsp;and the idea that he may soon be rid of his digestive issues \u2014&amp;nbsp;propelled him forward. Sitting on the bed, facing the hotel window, he took a few deeps breaths and raised the pill in the air. \"YOLO,\" he said, tossing it into his mouth. It disappeared down his throat, followed by a gulp of water. Over the next three days, he\u2019d repeat this process, ingesting a total of eight poop pills. At one point he inadvertently tasted some of Michael\u2019s shit, which had gotten on the outside of certain capsules. He describes it tasting \"a little bitter.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Next, Zayner applied the donor skin bacteria. He removed his T-shirt and unscrewed a test tube filled with saline solution and the cotton inoculating swab that Zayner rubbed on Michael\u2019s arms. He applied the liquid \u2014&amp;nbsp;which should have been teeming with skin bacteria, Zayner told me \u2014&amp;nbsp;liberally on his arms, chest, and legs. Then, he grabbed the swab that had been in Michael\u2019s mouth, and applied it to the inside of his cheeks and onto his gums. He repeated this process with his nose.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At 6PM, one hour after he began the procedure, Zayner was \u2014 in theory \u2014 covered in Michael\u2019s microbiome. Then came the wait. \"The main risk right now is mostly with the pill that I took. If there\u2019s any toxic bacteria that grew on it or anything like that, it could put me in the hospital,\" Zayner said, settling into his makeshift quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For the next 60 hours, Zayner hid out in the hotel room, leaving only to buy snacks in the hotel commissary or eat in the hotel restaurant. He didn\u2019t shower, and spent most of his time on his computer or phone. He watched daytime TV and movies \u2014 &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Furious 7&lt;/em&gt;, anything really. His girlfriend Melissa visited him daily, but avoided touching him, and didn\u2019t spend the night. Every few hours, Zayner repeated his protocol: take another pill, reapply Michael\u2019s bacteria, and take samples of his own skin.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On day two, Zayner told me he was feeling great. \"I\u2019m so excited and happy,\" he said, sitting on the hotel bed. \"I really feel like I shed something.\" He admitted it may have been a placebo effect, but his bowel movements had become less frequent, he said, and he felt rejuvenated.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;By the morning of day three, Zayner was relaxed. Taking time off from running The ODIN had done him some good, he said, and his stomach was cooperating \u2014 he went almost 24 hours without having to use the bathroom. \"Yesterday was a really awesome day so I was like \u2018Oh, my gosh. It feels really good,\u2019 but then today feels even better than yesterday,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But when he came home the next day, Zayner\u2019s resolve to follow through with the transfer weakened. He had originally intended to keep taking the pills at home for a few more days. But after three days, he was too disgusted. He felt sick just thinking about them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Three days after the transfer, he reached out to Argonne National Laboratory, a nonprofit lab run by the University of Chicago, to get his samples sequenced. He sent them a total of 77 samples, which included Michael\u2019s donated poop; Zayner\u2019s poop before, during, and after the transplant; as well as samples taken from Michael and Zayner\u2019s nose, mouth, and skin. He even sent in a skin swab from Melissa and myself, as well as skin and fur samples from his two cats \u2014 James Baxter and Trypsin \u2014 to see if we had inadvertently contaminated the experiment. The sequencing cost about $4,500. The process, Zayner was told, would take six to eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Zayner in his room\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h4X5FPz-ohPe2IE88WC2zwRQrso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434425/vpavic_160217_1033_0018.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There\u2019s essentially no&lt;/strong&gt; research on the long-term effects of fecal transplants, but some scientists are starting to look at the short-term effects. In late April, &lt;a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6285/586\"&gt;scientists announced&lt;/a&gt; that when patients receive FMTs, the new bacterial strains can survive for at least three months after the procedure. That means one day it might be possible to introduce customized bacteria to fully replace one\u2019s natural gut microbiome. But that hasn\u2019t changed the fact that fecal transplants are reserved to patients with &lt;i&gt;C. diff&lt;/i&gt; \u2014&amp;nbsp;and no one else.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fecal transplants are reserved to patients with C. diff \u2014 and no one else&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Zayner is unique, but as far as his pain goes, he isn\u2019t alone. Gastrointestinal diseases affect between 60 and 70 million Americans each year, &lt;a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/digestive-diseases-statistics-for-the-united-states.aspx#1\"&gt;according to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. This number includes people with cancer and liver disease, but also individuals with chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome \u2014&amp;nbsp;conditions that aren\u2019t deadly, but aren\u2019t necessarily easy to treat, either. So for people, like Zayner, who haven\u2019t found symptom relief through conventional means, turning to feces \u2014 the drug that everyone has access to for free \u2014 isn\u2019t all that surprising.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Home remedies are nothing new, but in the internet age, information on \"cures\" that others have tried have become increasingly available. Finding someone who\u2019s willing to walk you through a \"&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLIndT7fuGo\"&gt;home enema preparation&lt;/a&gt;\" is as easy as doing a YouTube search. And there\u2019s no shortage of &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/38gbok/at_wits_end_doing_diy_fecal_transplant_tomorrow/\"&gt;Reddit threads&lt;/a&gt; and internet comment sections where people can discuss their use of FMTs to cure a spectrum of ailments. In that respect, Zayner\u2019s just the latest addition to a movement of individuals who \u2014 for better or worse \u2014&amp;nbsp;have taken their digestive health into their own hands. \"I hear from a shocking number of people who are doing things like this,\" says Catherine Duff, founder of &lt;a href=\"http://thefecaltransplantfoundation.org/\"&gt;The Fecal Transplant Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit that aims to help FMT patients and raise awareness of the procedure. \"Mostly for gastrointestinal things, but also for almost anything you can think of.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Duff doesn\u2019t advocate for DIY transplants, but people still contact her to inquire about them. \"My concern is that there are so many desperate people who haven\u2019t found an answer with big pharma, and so they search for a magic bullet,\" she says. \"But generally people don\u2019t seem to have a grasp on what the long-term effects of this could be \u2014 because nobody knows.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Zayner cat\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8Z36xC2NVAkOPaJkF47mxo0bcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6434421/vpavic_160217_1033_0022.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few weeks&lt;/strong&gt; after his transplant, Zayner traveled to New Orleans to participate in the 2016 Bayer AgVocacy Forum. The last time he attended, four or five years ago, his digestive system didn\u2019t fare well. This time it was different.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In an email he sent entitled \"new stomach is a powerhouse,\" he described a gluttonous diet: chicken fried steak, beignets, and a po\u2019 boy with a crawfish reduction. The conference also involved lots of drinking: over the course of three days, Zayner had beer, shots of Jameson, a frozen hurricane, gin and tonics, and vodka Red Bulls. His stomach \"powered through like I was 21,\" he wrote, ecstatic. He was defecating only once a day. \"It\u2019s weird, but so cool,\" he added. \"No matter how much I have changed my diet over the years from mostly vegetarian to mostly meatatarian, it never changed my poop schedule \u2014 it gives me hope.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"That is pretty insane,\" he said in a shaky voice. \"The experiment actually worked.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Then, two weeks ago, I received a text message from him. Argonne National Laboratory had completed the sequencing. With the results in hand, Zayner performed a statistical analysis to find out if the bacterial composition of his skin, nose, mouth, and feces had changed over time \u2014 and whether the transplant had caused it to resemble Michael\u2019s. Days later, Zayner revealed the results of the analysis to me \u2014 and to himself \u2014&amp;nbsp;over Skype.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The connection was poor, but I could tell from Zayner\u2019s pixelated face that he was becoming emotional. The bacterial composition of Zayner\u2019s post-transplant feces were consistently more closely related to Michael\u2019s feces than his own poop prior to the experiment. \"That is pretty insane,\" he said in a shaky voice. \"The experiment actually worked.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The skin microbiome transfer results were less impressive. During Zayner\u2019s stay at the hotel, the bacterial composition of the skin on his arms morphed to resemble Michael\u2019s. But that didn\u2019t last long: once he was back home, the arm samples began to resemble samples taken from his girlfriend and his cat. The results for his mouth and nose were all over the place, making it hard to reach any conclusions. The experiment was both a hit and a miss, but for Zayner it was a success. \"It\u2019s exciting to think that we have a chance to affect the outcome of our own lives in these medical instances.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To get reliable results, scientific researchers typically follow rigorous protocols: multiple participants, control groups, perfectly controlled conditions. Zayner did none of that. Jason Koval, a microbiologist who does independent sequencing work in Argonne\u2019s labs, replicated Zayner\u2019s analysis, and his results were almost identical to Zayner\u2019s. But because of Zayner\u2019s lack of rigor, he was more skeptical of the experiment\u2019s conclusion. The small number of samples Zayner collected means that it would be almost impossible to tell if the differences he found between various samples are statistically significant. As a result, his experiment is more of an anecdote than science, Koval said. \"It\u2019s a fascinating pilot study,\" but \"you can\u2019t firmly say \u2018yes, this happened.\u2019\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;* *&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Skyped with&lt;/strong&gt; Zayner in early May. He looked sweaty and tired. Running The ODIN was stressful, he said. But more than two months after the transplant, he was still feeling a lot better \u2014&amp;nbsp;and defecating a lot less. \"Probably 95 percent to 99 percent of the time, it\u2019s only once in the morning,\" he told me.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We also talked about his new living arrangements \u2014&amp;nbsp;he\u2019s moved to a larger home in the East Bay with his brother, his girlfriend, and one of his ODIN employees \u2014&amp;nbsp;and about his recent weight loss. He said he\u2019s lost about 10 pounds which was both good news and a bit concerning.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Before the call ended, we discussed one more piece of anecdotal evidence that the transplant had worked: Zayner\u2019s newfound taste for sweets. Gut bacteria has been shown to &lt;a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/gut-bacteria-controls-your-brain\"&gt;influence what a person eats&lt;/a&gt; and Michael, Zayner\u2019s friend-turned-stool-donor, has a serious sweet tooth: he can consume an entire a box of Oreos in one sitting.

Mora-Blanco was one of 60-odd twenty-somethings who\u2019d come to work at the still-unprofitable website.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Mora-Blanco\u2019s team \u2014 10 people in total \u2014 was dubbed The SQUAD (Safety, Quality, and User Advocacy Department). They worked in teams of four to six, some doing day shifts and some night, reviewing videos around the clock. Their job? To protect YouTube\u2019s fledgling brand by scrubbing the site of offensive or malicious content that had been flagged by users, or, as Mora-Blanco puts it, \"to keep us from becoming a shock site.\" The founders wanted YouTube to be something new, something better \u2014 \"a place for everyone\" \u2014 and not another eBaum\u2019s World, which had already become a repository for explicit pornography and gratuitous violence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Mora-Blanco sat next to Misty Ewing-Davis, who, having been on the job a few months, counted as an old hand. On the table before them was a single piece of paper, folded in half to show a bullet-point list of instructions: Remove videos of animal abuse. Remove videos showing blood. Remove visible nudity. Remove pornography. Mora-Blanco recalls her teammates were a \"mish-mash\" of men and women; gay and straight; slightly tipped toward white, but also Indian, African-American, and Filipino. Most of them were friends, friends of friends, or family. They talked and made jokes, trying to make sense of the rules. \"You have to find humor,\" she remembers. \"Otherwise it\u2019s just painful.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Videos arrived on their screens in a never-ending queue. After watching a couple seconds apiece, SQUAD members clicked one of four buttons that appeared in the upper right hand corner of their screens: \"Approve\" \u2014 let the video stand; \"Racy\" \u2014 mark video as 18-plus; \"Reject\" \u2014 remove video without penalty; \"Strike\" \u2014 remove video with a penalty to the account. Click, click, click. But that day Mora-Blanco came across something that stopped her in her tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;\"Oh, God,\" she said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene1\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle1\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style1\"&gt;That day Mora-Blanco came across something that stopped her in her tracks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Mora-Blanco won\u2019t describe what she saw that morning. For everyone\u2019s sake, she says, she won\u2019t conjure the staggeringly violent images which, she recalls, involved a toddler and a dimly lit hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Ewing-Davis calmly walked Mora-Blanco through her next steps: hit \"Strike,\" suspend the user, and forward the person\u2019s account details and the video to the SQUAD team\u2019s supervisor. From there, the information would travel to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509036/Google-blocks-child-porn-Internet-giant-axes-links-sex-abuse-websites.html\"&gt;CyberTipline&lt;/a&gt;, a reporting system launched by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in 1998. Footage of child exploitation was the only black-and-white zone of the job, with protocols outlined and explicitly &lt;a href=\"http://www.missingkids.com/History\"&gt;enforced by law since the late 1990s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The video disappeared from Mora-Blanco\u2019s screen. The next one appeared.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Ewing-Davis said, \"Let\u2019s go for a walk.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay. This is what you\u2019re doing&lt;/em&gt;, Mora-Blanco remembers thinking as they paced up and down the street. &lt;em&gt;You\u2019re going to be seeing bad stuff&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Almost a decade later, the video and the child in it still haunt her. \"In the back of my head, of all the images, I still see that one,\" she said when we spoke recently. \"I really didn\u2019t have a job description to review or a full understanding of what I\u2019d be doing. I was a young 25-year-old and just excited to be getting paid more money. I got to bring a computer home!\" Mora-Blanco\u2019s voice caught as she paused to collect herself. \"I haven\u2019t talked about this in a long time.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Mora-Blanco is one of more than a dozen current and former employees and contractors of major internet platforms from YouTube to Facebook who spoke to us candidly about the dawn of content moderation. Many of these individuals are going public with their experiences for the first time. Their stories reveal how the boundaries of free speech were drawn during a period of explosive growth for a high-stakes public domain, one that did not exist for most of human history. As law professor Jeffrey Rosen &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/technology/13facebook.html?_r=0\"&gt;first said&lt;/a&gt; many years ago of Facebook, these platforms have \"more power in determining who can speak and who can be heard around the globe than any Supreme Court justice, any king or any president.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr class=\"roots_div4\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;p class=\"pt-dropcap\"&gt;Launched in 2005, YouTube was the brainchild of Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim\u2014three men in their 20s who were frustrated because technically there was no easy way for them to share two particularly compelling videos: clips of the 2004 tsunami that had devastated southeast Asia, and Janet Jackson\u2019s Superbowl \"wardrobe malfunction.\" In April of 2005, they tested their first upload. By October, they had posted their first one million-view hit: Brazilian soccer phenom Ronaldinho trying out a pair of gold cleats. A year later, Google paid an unprecedented $1.65 billion to buy the site. Mora-Blanco got a title: content policy strategist, or in her words, \"middle man.\" Sitting between the front lines and content policy, she handled all escalations from the front-line moderators, coordinating with YouTube\u2019s policy analyst. By mid-2006, YouTube viewers were watching more than &lt;a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-07-16-youtube-views_x.htm\"&gt;100 million videos&lt;/a&gt; a day.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In its earliest days, YouTube attracted a small group of people who mostly shared videos of family and friends. But as volume on the site exploded, so did the range of content: clips of commercial films and music videos were being uploaded, as well as huge volumes of amateur and professional pornography. (Even today, the latter eclipses every other category of violating content.) Videos of child abuse, beatings, and animal cruelty followed. By late 2007, YouTube had codified its commitment to respecting copyright law through the creation of a &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/content-verification-program.html\"&gt;Content Verification Program&lt;/a&gt;. But screening malicious content would prove to be far more complex, and required intensive human labor.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene2\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle2\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style2\"&gt;They followed a guiding-light question: \"Can I share this video with my family?\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes exhausted, sometimes elated, and always under intense pressure, the SQUAD reviewed all of YouTube\u2019s flagged content, developing standards as they went. They followed a guiding-light question: \"Can I share this video with my family?\" For the most part, they worked independently, debating and arguing among themselves; on particularly controversial issues, strategists like Mora-Blanco conferred with YouTube\u2019s founders. In the process, they drew up some of the earliest outlines for what was fast becoming a new field of work, an industry that had never before been systematized or scaled: professional moderation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;By fall 2006, working with data and video illustrations from the SQUAD, YouTube\u2019s lawyer, head of policy, and head of support created the company\u2019s first booklet of rules for the team, which, Mora-Blanco recalls, was only about six pages long. Like the one-pager that preceded it, copies of the booklet sat on the table and were constantly marked up, then updated with new bullet points every few weeks or so. No booklet could ever be complete, no policy definitive. This small team of improvisers had yet to grasp that they were helping to develop new global standards for free speech.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In 2007, the SQUAD helped create YouTube\u2019s first clearly articulated rules for users. They barred depictions of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography\"&gt;pornography&lt;/a&gt;, criminal acts, gratuitous violence, threats, spam, and hate speech. But significant gaps in the guidelines remained \u2014 gaps that would challenge users as well as the moderators. The Google press office, which now handles YouTube communications, did not agree to an interview after multiple requests.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;As YouTube grew up, so did the videos uploaded to it: the platform became an increasingly important host for newsworthy video. For members of the SQUAD, none of whom had significant journalism experience, this sparked a series of new decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Moderation head final\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9pyggkN8kQtp4-8V0jO9tLvEnow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6330627/ericPetersen_poolOfBlood_RGB_fin.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2009, Iranian protesters poured into the streets, disputing the presidential victory of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad\"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;. Dubbed the Green Movement, it was one of the most significant political events in the country\u2019s post-Revolutionary history. Mora-Blanco, soon to become a senior content specialist, and her team \u2014 now dubbed Policy and more than two-dozen strong \u2014 monitored the many protest clips being uploaded to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;On June 20th, the team was confronted with a video depicting the death of a young woman named &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/world/middleeast/23neda.html?_r=0\"&gt;Neda Agha-Soltan&lt;/a&gt;. The 26-year-old had been struck by a single bullet to the chest during demonstrations against pro-government forces and a shaky cell-phone video captured her horrific last moments: in it, blood pours from her eyes, pooling beneath her.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Within hours of the video\u2019s upload, it became a focal point for Mora-Blanco and her team. As she recalls, the guidelines they\u2019d developed offered no clear directives regarding what constituted newsworthiness or what, in essence, constituted ethical journalism involving graphic content and the depiction of death. But she knew the video had political significance and was aware that their decision would contribute to its relevance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Mora-Blanco and her colleagues ultimately agreed to keep the video up. It was fueling important conversations about free speech and human rights on a global scale and was quickly turning into a viral symbol of the movement. It had tremendous political power. &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; had tremendous political power. And the clip was already available elsewhere, driving massive traffic to competing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The Policy team worked quickly with the legal department to relax its gratuitous violence policy, on the fly creating a newsworthiness exemption. An engineer swiftly designed a button warning that the content contained graphic violence \u2014 a content violation under normal circumstances \u2014 and her team made the video available behind it, where it still sits today. Hundreds of thousands of individuals, in Iran and around the world, could witness the brutal death of a pro-democracy protester at the hands of government. The maneuvers that allowed the content to stand took less than a day.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr class=\"roots_div3\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;p class=\"pt-dropcap\"&gt;Today, YouTube\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html\"&gt;billion-plus&lt;/a&gt; users upload 400 hours of video every minute. Every hour, Instagram users &lt;a href=\"http://mashable.com/2013/09/16/facebook-photo-uploads/#etm3I0VEwEqr\"&gt;generate&lt;/a&gt; 146 million \"likes\" and Twitter users send 21 million tweets. Last August, Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102329188394581\"&gt;posted on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; that the site had passed \"an important milestone: For the first time ever, one billion people used Facebook in a single day.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The moderators of these platforms \u2014 perched uneasily at the intersection of corporate profits, social responsibility, and human rights \u2014 have a powerful impact on free speech, government dissent, the shaping of social norms, user safety, and the meaning of privacy. What flagged content should be removed? Who decides what stays and why? What constitutes newsworthiness? Threat? Harm? When should law enforcement be involved?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;While public debates rage about government censorship and free speech on college campuses, customer content management constitutes the quiet transnational transfer of free-speech decisions to the private, corporately managed corners of the internet where people weigh competing values in hidden and proprietary ways. Moderation, explains Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford, is \"a profoundly human decision-making process about what constitutes appropriate speech in the public domain.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene3\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle1\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style1\"&gt;Moderation is \"a profoundly human decision-making process.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;During a panel at this year\u2019s South by Southwest, Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of global product policy, shared that Facebook users flag more than one million items of content for review every day. The stakes of moderation can be immense. As of last summer, social media platforms \u2014 predominantly Facebook \u2014 accounted for 43 percent of all traffic to major news sites. Nearly two-thirds of Facebook and Twitter users access their news through their feeds. Unchecked social media is routinely implicated in sectarian brutality, intimate partner violence, violent extremist recruitment, and episodes of mass bullying linked to suicides.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Content flagged as violent \u2014 a beating or beheading \u2014 may be newsworthy. Content flagged as \"pornographic\" might be political in nature, or as innocent as breastfeeding or sunbathing. Content posted as comedy might get flagged for overt racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, homophobia, or transphobia. Meanwhile content that may not explicitly violate rules is sometimes posted by users to perpetrate abuse or vendettas, terrorize political opponents, or out sex workers or trans people. Trolls and criminals exploit anonymity to dox, swat, extort, exploit rape, and, on some occasions, broadcast murder. Abusive men threaten spouses. Parents blackmail children. In Pakistan, the group Bytes for All \u2014 an organization that previously &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytes_for_All_v._Federation_of_Pakistan\"&gt;sued the Pakistani government&lt;/a&gt; for censoring YouTube videos \u2014 released three &lt;a href=\"https://content.bytesforall.pk/sites/default/files/Tech_Driven_Violence_Against_Women.pdf\"&gt;case studies&lt;/a&gt; showing that social media and mobile tech cause real harm to women in the country by enabling rapists to blackmail victims (who may face imprisonment after being raped), and stoke sectarian violence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;A prevailing narrative, as one story in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; put it, is that the current system of content moderation is \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/the-way-we-report-harassment-on-the-social-web-is-broken/378730/\"&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt;.\" For &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/the-unsafety-net-how-social-media-turned-against-women/381261/\"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; who\u2019ve been harmed by online content, it is difficult to argue that \"broken\" isn\u2019t exactly the right word. But something must be whole before it can fall apart. Interviews with dozens of industry experts and insiders over 18 months revealed that moderation practices with global ramifications have been marginalized within major firms, undercapitalized, or even ignored. To an alarming degree, the early seat-of-the-pants approach to moderation policy persists today, hidden by an industry that largely refuses to participate in substantive public conversations or respond in detail to media inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In an October 2014 &lt;a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/10/content-moderation/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;, Adrian Chen documented the work of front line moderators operating in modern-day sweatshops. In Manila, Chen witnessed a secret \"army of workers employed to soak up the worst of humanity in order to protect the rest of us.\" Media coverage and researchers have compared their work to garbage collection, but the work they perform is critical to preserving any sense of decency and safety online, and literally saves lives \u2014 often those of children. For front-line moderators, these jobs can be crippling. Beth Medina, who runs a program called &lt;a href=\"http://shiftwellness.org\"&gt;SHIFT&lt;/a&gt; (Supporting Heroes in Mental Health Foundational Training), which has provided resilience training to Internet Crimes Against Children teams since 2009, details the severe health costs of sustained exposure to toxic images: isolation, relational difficulties, burnout, depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. \"There are inherent difficulties doing this kind of work,\" Chen said, \"because the material is so traumatic.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene4\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle2\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style2\"&gt;Even basic facts about the content moderation industry remain a mystery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;But as hidden as that army is, the orders it follows are often even more opaque \u2014 crafted by an amalgam of venture capitalists, CEOs, policy, community, privacy and trust and safety managers, lawyers, and engineers working thousands of miles away. Sarah T. Roberts is an assistant professor of Information and Media Studies at Western University and author of the forthcoming &lt;em&gt;Behind the Screen: Digitally Laboring in Social Media\u2019s Shadow World&lt;/em&gt;. She says \"commercial content moderation\" \u2014 a term she coined to denote the kind of professional, organized moderation featured in this article \u2014 is not a cohesive system, but a wild range of evolving practices spun up as needed, subject to different laws in different countries, and often woefully inadequate for the task at hand. These practices routinely collapse under the weight and complexity of new challenges \u2014 as the decisions moderators make engage ever more profound matters of legal and human rights, with outcomes that affect users, workers, and our digital public commons. As seen with &lt;a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/10/how-black-lives-matter-uses-social-media-to-fight-the-power/\"&gt;Black Lives Matter&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/books/review/how-an-egyptian-revolution-began-on-facebook.html?_r=1\"&gt;Arab Spring&lt;/a&gt;, whether online content stays or goes has the power to shape movements and revolutions, as well as the sweeping policy reforms and cultural shifts they spawn.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Yet, even basic facts about the industry remain a mystery. Last month, in a piece titled \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2015/04/15/moderating-facebook/\"&gt;Moderating Facebook: The Dark Side of Social Networking&lt;/a&gt;,\" Who Is Hosting This? suggested that one third of \"Facebook\u2019s entire workforce\" is comprised of moderators, a number Facebook refutes as an overestimate. Content moderation is fragmented into in-house departments, boutique firms, call centers, and micro-labor sites, all complemented by untold numbers of algorithmic and automated products. Hemanshu Nigam, founder of SSP Blue, which advises companies in online safety, security, and privacy, &lt;a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/10/content-moderation/\"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that the number of people working in moderation is \"well over 100,000.\" Others speculate that the number is many times that.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;center&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Moderation face final\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4uRe5ocbsjgEot5nFodOj20M-b0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6330631/ericPetersen_coverEyes_RGB_fin.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;/center&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;At industry leaders such as Facebook, Pinterest, and YouTube, the moderation process is improving drastically; at other platforms it might as well be 2006. There, systems are tied to the hands-off approach of an earlier era, and continue to reflect distinct user and founder sensibilities. At 4chan, for example, users are instructed against violating US law but are also free to post virtually any type of content, as long as they do so on clearly defined boards. According to the site\u2019s owner Hiroyuki Nishimura, 4chan still relies heavily on a volunteer system of user-nominated \"janitors.\" These janitors, Nishimura said in a recent email exchange, play a critical role, \"tasked with keeping the imageboards free of rule-breaking content.\" As a janitor application page on &lt;a href=\"https://www.4chan.org/janitorapp\"&gt;the website&lt;/a&gt; lays out, \"Janitors are able to view the reports queue, delete posts, and submit ban and warn requests\" for their assigned board. 4chan janitors, Nishimura said, use \"chat channels,\" to discuss content questions with supervising moderators, some paid, some unpaid. \"If they can\u2019t decide,\" he wrote, \"they ask me, so that I\u2019m the last one in 4chan. And, in case I couldn\u2019t judge. I asked with lawyers.\" Even after more than a decade, 4chan remains a site frequently populated by harassment and threats. Content has included everything from widespread distribution of &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/09/25/absolutely-everything-you-need-to-know-to-understand-4chan-the-internets-own-bogeyman/\"&gt;nonconsensual porn&lt;/a&gt;, to \"&lt;a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/racists-on-4chan-niggerwalks\"&gt;Niggerwalk&lt;/a&gt;\" memes, to &lt;a href=\"http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/racist-messages-on-osu-chat-appear-to-have-been-organized/article_0cb481b2-824e-5699-a86b-747bbb17f849.html\"&gt;racist mobs evoking Hitler&lt;/a&gt; and threatening individual users. \"People who try to do bad things use YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and 4chan also,\" Nishimura told us. \"As long as such people live in the world, it happens. Right now, I don\u2019t know how to stop them and I really want to know. If there is a way to stop it, we definitely follow the way.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene5\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle1\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style1\"&gt;The details of moderation practices are routinely  treated as trade secrets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The details of moderation practices are routinely hidden from public view, siloed within companies and treated as trade secrets when it comes to users and the public. Despite persistent calls from civil society advocates for transparency, social media companies do not publish details of their internal content moderation guidelines; no major platform has made such guidelines public. Very little is known about how platforms set their policies \u2014 current and former employees like Mora-Blanco and others we spoke to are constrained by nondisclosure agreements. Facebook officials Monika Bickert and Ellen Silver, head of Facebook\u2019s Community Support Team, responded to questions regarding their current moderation practices, and Pinterest made safety manager Charlotte Willner available for an interview. However, Facebook and Pinterest, along with Twitter, Reddit, and Google, all declined to provide copies of their past or current internal moderation policy guidelines. Twitter, Reddit, and Google also declined multiple interview requests before deadline. When asked to discuss Twitter\u2019s Trust and Safety teams\u2019 operations, for example, a spokesperson wrote only:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;\"Our rules are designed to allow our users to create and share a wide variety of content in an environment that is safe and secure for our users. When content is reported to us that violates our rules, which include a ban on violent threats and targeted abuse, we suspend those accounts. We evaluate and refine our policies based on input from users, while working with outside safety organizations to ensure that we have industry best practices in place.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Several motives drive secrecy, according to Crawford, Willner, and others. On the one hand, executives want to guard proprietary tech property and gain cover from liability. On the other, they want the flexibility to respond to nuanced, fast-moving situations, and they want to both protect employees who feel vulnerable to public scrutiny and protect the platform from users eager to game a policy made public. The obvious costs of keeping such a significant, quasi-governmental function under wraps rarely rank as a corporate concern. \"How,\" asks Roberts, the content moderation researcher, \"do you or I effect change on moderation practices if they\u2019re treated as industrial secrets?\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Dave Willner was at Facebook between 2008 and 2013, most of that time as head of content policy, and is now in charge of community policy at Airbnb. Last spring, we met with him in San Francisco. He wore a rumpled red henley and jeans, and he talked and walked fast as we made our way across the Mission.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Members of the public, \"as much as \u2018the public\u2019 exists,\" he said, hold one of three assumptions about moderation: moderation is conducted entirely by robots; moderation is mainly in the hands of law enforcement; or, for those who are actually aware of content managers, they imagine content is assessed in a classroom-type setting by engaged professionals thoughtfully discussing every post. All three assumptions, he said, were wrong. And they\u2019re wrong, in great part, because they all miss the vital role that users themselves play in these systems.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene6\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle2\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style2\"&gt;The public holds one of three assumptions about moderation. All three assumptions are wrong&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;By and large, users think of themselves as customers, or consumers. But platforms rely on users in three profound ways that alter that linear relationship: One, users produce content \u2014 our stories, photos, videos, comments, and interactions are core assets for the platforms we use; two, user behaviors \u2014 amassed, analyzed, packed, and repackaged \u2014 are the source of advertising revenue; and three, users play a critical role in moderation, since almost every content moderation system depends on users flagging content and filing complaints, shaping the norms that support a platform\u2019s brand. In other words, users are not so much customers as uncompensated digital laborers who play dynamic and indispensable functions (despite being largely uninformed about the ways in which their labor is being used and capitalized).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Anne Collier, the founder of &lt;a href=\"http://icanhelpline.org\"&gt;iCanHelpline&lt;/a&gt;, a social media tool for schools, suggests that users have not yet recognized their collective power to fix the harms users have themselves created in social media. \"They\u2019re called \u2018users\u2019 for a reason,\" she said, \"and collectively still think and behave as passive consumers.\" By obfuscating their role, she argues, the industry delays users\u2019 recognition of their agency and power.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Some of the larger companies \u2014 notably Facebook and Google \u2014 engage civil society through the creation of expert task forces and targeted subject matter working sessions dedicated to the problem of online harassment and crime. Organizations such as the Global Network Initiative, the Anti-Cyberhate Working Group, Facebook\u2019s Safety Advisory Board, and Twitter\u2019s new Trust and Safety Council are all examples of such multidisciplinary gatherings that bring together subject matter experts. However, these debates (unlike say, congressional hearings), are shielded from public view, as both corporate and civil society participants remain nearly silent about the deliberations. Without greater transparency, users, consumers \u2014 the public at large \u2014 are ill-equipped to understand exactly how platforms work and how their own speech is being regulated and why. This means that the most basic tools of accountability and governance \u2014 public and legal pressure \u2014 simply don\u2019t exist.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr class=\"roots_div2\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;p class=\"pt-dropcap\"&gt;In the earliest \"information wants to be free\" days of the internet, objectives were lofty. Online access was supposed to unleash positive and creative human potential, not provide a venue for sadists, child molesters, rapists, or racial supremacists. Yet this radically free internet quickly became a &lt;a href=\"http://www.cybercrimejournal.com/editorialijccjuly2008.pdf\"&gt;terrifying&lt;/a&gt; home to heinous content and the users who posted and consumed it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This early phase, from its earliest inceptions in the 1960s until 2000, is what J.G.&amp;nbsp;Palfrey, the former executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, calls &lt;a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/teaching/ilaw/2011/Summary_of_Four_Phases\"&gt;the Open Internet&lt;/a&gt;. It was in great part the result of 1996\u2019s &amp;nbsp;Communications Decency Act\u2019s Section 230(c), known as the Good Samaritan Act, which absolved companies of liability for content shared on their services.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Section 230 is widely cherished as the &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/08/27/a-bit-of-internet-history-or-how-two-members-of-congress-helped-create-a-trillion-or-so-dollars-of-value/\"&gt;\"most important law on the Internet,\"&lt;/a&gt; credited with making possible a \"trillion or so dollars of value\" according to David Post, legal scholar and fellow at the Center for Democracy and Technology. He &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/08/27/a-bit-of-internet-history-or-how-two-members-of-congress-helped-create-a-trillion-or-so-dollars-of-value/\"&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; Section 230, &amp;nbsp;a \"rather remarkable provision.\" It reads: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" These 26 words put free speech decisions into private hands, effectively immunizing platforms from legal liability for all content that does not violate federal law, such as child pornography. All the checks and balances that govern traditional media would not apply; with no libel risk there were, in effect, no rules.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene7\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle2\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style2\"&gt;On the internet, the checks and balances that govern traditional media would not apply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Moderation\u2019s initially haphazard, laissez-faire culture has its roots here. Before companies understood how a &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of moderation could impede growth and degrade brands and community, moderators were volunteers; unpaid and virtually invisible. At AOL, moderation was managed by a &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_Community_Leader_Program\"&gt;Community Leader program&lt;/a&gt; composed of users who had previously moderated chat rooms and reported \"offensive\" content. They were tasked with building \"communities\" in exchange for having their subscription fees waived.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;By 2000, companies had begun to take a more proactive approach. CompuServe, for instance, developed one of the earliest \"acceptable use\" policies barring racist speech, after a user with a Holocaust revisionist stance started filling a popular forum with antisemitic commentary. In 2001, eBay &lt;a href=\"http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/758221/eBay+Bans+Nazi+Hate+Group+Memorabilia.htm\"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; Nazi and Ku Klux Klan memorabilia, as well as other symbols of racial, religious, and ethnic hatred. Democratized countries joined forces to take down child pornography. Palfrey calls this phase Access Denied, characterized by a concerted effort across the industry and the government to ban unappetizing content.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, companies and governments honed these first-generation moderation tools, refining policies and collapsing the myth that cyberspace existed on a separate plane from real life, free from the realities of regulation, law, and policy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This was the era in which Mora-Blanco began her career at YouTube. Trying to bring order to a digital Wild West one video at a time was grueling. To safeguard other employees from seeing the disturbing images in the reported content they were charged with reviewing, her team was sequestered in corner offices; their rooms were kept dark and their computers were equipped with the largest screen protectors on the market.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Members of the team quickly showed signs of stress \u2014 anxiety, drinking, trouble sleeping \u2014 and eventually managers brought in a therapist. As moderators described the images they saw each day, the therapist fell silent. The therapist, Mora-Blanco says, was \"quite literally scared.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Around 2008, she recalls, YouTube expanded moderation to offices in Dublin, Ireland and Hyderabad, India. Suicide and child abuse don\u2019t follow a schedule, and employing moderators across different time zones enabled the company to provide around-the-clock support. But it also exposed a fundamental challenge of moderating content across cultures.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene8\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle1\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style1\"&gt;He quietly began removing blackface videos. At the time, YouTube considered blackface non-malicious&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Soon after the expansion, Mora-Blanco found herself debating a flagged video that appeared to show a group of students standing in a circle with two boys brawling in the middle. Moderation guidelines prohibited content showing minors engaged in fighting for entertainment and are written to be as globally applicable and translatable as possible. But interpretation of those guidelines, she discovered, could be surprisingly fluid. Moderators in India let the flagged video remain live because to them, the people in the video were not children, but adults. When the video was flagged again, it escalated to the Silicon Valley team, as most escalations reportedly still do. To Mora-Blanco, the video clearly violated YouTube\u2019s policy. \"I didn\u2019t know how to more plainly describe what I was seeing,\" she said. The video came down.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Cultural perspective is a constant and pervasive issue, despite attempts to make \"objective\" rules. One former screener from a major video-sharing platform, who participated in &lt;a href=\"http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/commpub/12/\"&gt;Roberts\u2019 research&lt;/a&gt; and spoke with us on the condition of anonymity, recounted watching videos of what he characterized as extreme violence \u2014 murder and beatings \u2014 coming from Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The screener was instructed to take down videos depicting drug-related violence in Mexico, while those of political violence in Syria and Russia were to remain live. This distinction angered him. Regardless of the country, people were being murdered in what were, in effect, all civil wars. \"[B]asically,\" he said, \"our policies are meant to protect certain groups.\" Before he left, he quietly began removing blackface videos he encountered. At the time, YouTube considered blackface non-malicious.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Moderation moderators final\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r4TP_rGbs1gx6nffznLT7FhWPMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6330663/ericPetersen_moderators_RGB_fin.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When Dave Willner arrived at Facebook in 2008, the team there was working on its own \"one-pager\" of cursory, gut-check guidelines. \"Child abuse, animal abuse, Hitler,\" Willner recalls. \"We were told to take down anything that makes you feel bad, that makes you feel bad in your stomach.\" Willner had just moved to Silicon Valley to join his girlfriend, then Charlotte Carnevale, now Charlotte Willner, who had become head of Facebook\u2019s International Support Team. Over the next six years, as Facebook grew from less than 100 million users to well over a billion, the two worked side by side, developing and implementing the company\u2019s first formal moderation guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene9\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle2\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style2\"&gt;\"If Facebook is here to make the world more open, why would you delete anything?\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;\"We were called The Ninjas,\" he said, \"mapping the rabbit hole.\" Like Mora-Blanco, Willner described how he, Charlotte, and their colleagues sometimes laughed about their work, so that they wouldn\u2019t cry. \"To outsiders, that sounds demented,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Just like at YouTube, the subjectivity of Facebook\u2019s moderation policy was glaring. \"Yes, deleting Hitler feels awesome,\" Willner recalls thinking. \"But, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; do we delete Hitler? If Facebook is here to make the world more open,\" he asked himself, \"why would you delete anything?\" The job, he says, was \"to figure out Facebook\u2019s central &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For people like Dave and Charlotte Willner, the questions are as complex now as they were a decade ago. How do we understand the context of a picture? How do we assign language meaning? Breaking the code for context \u2014 nailing down the ineffable question of why one piece of content is acceptable but a slight variation breaks policy \u2014 remains the holy grail of moderation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In the absence of a perfectly automated system, Willner said, there are two kinds of human moderation. One set of decisions relies on observable qualities that involve minimal interpretation. For example, a moderator can see if a picture contains imagery of a naked toddler in a dimly lit hotel room \u2014 clearly a violation. In these cases, trained moderators can easily lean on detailed guidance manuals. The other method of decision, however, is more complex and interpretation is central. Recognizing bullying, for example, depends on understanding relationships and context, and moderators are not privy to either.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;\"For instance, let\u2019s say that I wear a green dress to work one day and everyone makes fun of me for it,\" explained Facebook\u2019s Monika Bickert when we talked. \"Then when I get home, people have posted on my Facebook profile pictures of green frogs or posts saying, \u2018I love your dress!\u2019 If I report those posts and photos to Facebook, it won\u2019t necessarily be clear to the content reviewers exactly what is going on. We try to keep that in mind when we write our policies, and we also try to make sure our content reviewers consider all relevant content when making a decision.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Created in 2009, Facebook\u2019s first \"abuse standards\" draft ran 15,000 words and was, Willner said, \"an attempt to be all-encompassing.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;While Willner is bound by an NDA to not discuss the document, a leaked Facebook cheat sheet used by freelance moderators made news in 2012. (Willner says the sheet included some minor misinterpretations and errors.) \"Humor and cartoon humor is an exception for hate speech unless slur words are being used or humor is not evident,\" read one rule. \"Users may not describe sexual activity in writing, except when an attempt at humor or insult,\" read another. Moderators were given explicit examples regarding the types of messages and photos described and told to review only the reported content, not unreported adjacent content. As in US law, content referring to \"ordinary people\" was treated differently than \"public figures.\" \"Poaching of animals should be confirmed. Poaching of endangered animals should be escalated.\" Things like \"urine, feces, vomit, semen, pus and earwax,\" were too graphic, but cartoon representations of feces and urine were allowed. Internal organs? No. Excessive blood? OK. \"Blatant (obvious) depiction of camel toes and moose knuckles?\" Prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene10\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle1\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style1\"&gt;Internal organs? No. Excessive blood? OK.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The \"Sex and Nudity\" section perhaps best illustrates the regulations\u2019 subjectivity and cultural biases. The cheat sheet barred naked children, women\u2019s nipples, and \"butt cracks.\" But such images are obviously not considered inappropriate in all settings and the rules remain subject to cultural contexts.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In 2012, for instance, when headlines were lauding social media for its role in catalyzing the Arab Spring, a Syrian protester named Dana Bakdounes posted a picture of herself with a sign advocating for women\u2019s equal rights. In the image Bakdounes is unveiled, wearing a tank top. A Facebook moderator &lt;a href=\"http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=455346&amp;amp;MID=11&amp;amp;PID=2\"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the photo and blocked the administrators of an organization she supported, Uprising of Women in the Arab World. Her picture had been reported by conservatives who believed that images of women, heads uncovered and shoulders bare, constituted obscenity. Following public protest, Facebook quickly issued an apology and \"worked to rectify the mistake.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The issue of female nudity and culturally bound definitions of obscenity remains thorny. Last spring, Facebook blocked a 1909 photograph of an indigenous woman with her breasts exposed, a violation of the company\u2019s ever evolving rules about female toplessness. In response, the Brazilian Ministry of Culture announced its intention to sue the company. Several weeks later, protesters in the United States, part of the #SayHerName movement, confronted Facebook and Instagram over the removal of photographs in which they had used nudity to highlight the plight of black women victimized by the police.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr class=\"roots_div1\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;p class=\"pt-dropcap\"&gt;In early March, at packed panel at South by Southwest called \"How Far Should We Go To Protect Hate Speech Online?\" Jeffrey Rosen, now president of the National Constitution Center, was joined by Juniper Downs, head of public policy at Google / YouTube, and Facebook\u2019s Monika Bickert, among others. At one point, midway through the panel, Rosen turned to Downs and Bickert, describing them as \"the two most powerful women in the world when it comes to free speech.\" The two demurred. Entire organizations, they suggested, make content decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Not exactly. Content management is rarely dealt with as a prioritized organizational concern \u2014 centrally bringing together legal, customer service, security, privacy, safety, marketing, branding, and personnel to create a unified approach. Rather, it is still usually shoehorned into structures never built for a task so complex.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene11\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle1\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style1\"&gt;Moderation remains a relatively low-wage, low-status sector, often managed and staffed by women&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The majority of industry insiders and experts we interviewed described moderation as siloed off from the rest of the organization. Few senior level decision-makers, they said \u2014 whether PR staff, lawyers, privacy and security experts, or brand and product managers \u2014 experience the material in question first-hand. One content moderator, on condition of anonymity, said her colleagues and supervisors never saw violent imagery because her job was to remove the most heinous items before they could. Instead, she was asked to describe it. \"I watched people\u2019s faces turn green.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Joi Podgorny is former vice president at ModSquad, which provides content moderation to a range of marquee clients, from the State Department to the NFL. Now a digital media consultant, she says founders and developers not only resist seeing the toxic content, they resist even understanding the practice of moderation. Typically cast off as \"customer-service,\" moderation and related work remains a relatively low-wage, low-status sector, &lt;a href=\"http://www.hiremorewomenintech.com\"&gt;often managed and staffed by women&lt;/a&gt;, which stands apart from the higher-status, higher-paid, more powerful sectors of engineering and finance, which are overwhelmingly male. \"I need you to look at what my people are looking at on a regular basis,\" she said. \"I want you to go through my training and see this stuff [and] you\u2019re not going to think it\u2019s free speech. You\u2019re going to think it\u2019s damaging to culture, not only for our brand, but in general.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Brian Pontarelli, CEO of the moderation software company Inversoft, echoes the observation. Many companies, he told us, will not engage in robust moderation until it will cost them not to. \"They sort of look at that as like, that\u2019s hard, and it\u2019s going to cost me a lot of money, and it\u2019s going to require a lot of work, and I don\u2019t really care unless it causes me to lose money,\" he said. \"Until that point, they can say to themselves that it\u2019s not hurting their revenue, people are still spending money with us, so why should we be doing it?\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When senior executives do get involved, they tend to parachute in during moments of crisis. In the wake of last December\u2019s San Bernardino shootings, Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman at Google, called on industry to build tools to reduce hate, harm, and friction in social media, \"sort of like spell-checkers, but for hate and harassment.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Likewise the words of former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo in an &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7982099/twitter-ceo-sent-memo-taking-personal-responsibility-for-the\"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt;, published by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in February 2015. \"We lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day,\" he wrote, concluding, \"We\u2019re going to start kicking these people off right and left and making sure that when they issue their ridiculous attacks, nobody hears them.\" As if it were so simple.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Mora-Blanco worked for five years at Twitter, where she said, \"there was a really strong cultural appreciation for the Trust &amp;amp; Safety team,\" responsible for moderation related to harassment and abuse. She joined the company in 2010 and soon became manager of the User Safety Policy Team, where she developed policies concerning abuse, harassment, suicide, child sexual exploitation, and hate speech. By the end of her tenure in early 2015, she had moved to the Public Policy team, where she helped to launch several initiatives to prevent hate speech, harassment, and child sexual exploitation, and to promote free speech.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene12\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle2\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style2\"&gt;For Reddit, leaving users largely to their own devices has translated into years of high-profile catastrophes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;\"It was embedded within the company, that the Trust &amp;amp; Safety team were doing important work,\" she said. Even so, she found, her team didn\u2019t have the tools to be effective. \"The Trust &amp;amp; Safety teams had lots of ideas on how to implement change,\" she said, \"but not the engineering support.\" Prior to 2014, according to Mora-Blanco and former Twitter engineer Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, there was not a single engineer dedicated to addressing harassment at Twitter. During the past two years, the company has taken steps to reconcile the need to stem abuse with its commitment to the broadest interpretation of unmoderated free speech, publicly announcing the formation of an advisory council and introducing training sessions with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;According to a source close to the moderation process at Reddit, the climate there is far worse. Despite the site\u2019s size and influence \u2014 attracting &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/about/traffic\"&gt;some 4 to 5 million page views a day&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Reddit has a full-time staff of only around 75 people, leaving Redditors to largely police themselves, following a \"&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette\"&gt;reddiquette&lt;/a&gt;\" post that outlines what constitutes acceptable behavior. Leaving users almost entirely to their own devices has translated into years of high-profile &lt;a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/07/hate_speech_on_reddit_a_simple_novel_plan_to_quarantine_it.2.html\"&gt;catastrophes&lt;/a&gt; involving virtually every form of objectionable content \u2014 including entire toxic subreddits such as &amp;nbsp;/r/jailbait, /r/creepshots, /r/teen_girls, /r/fatpeoplehate, /r/coontown, &amp;nbsp;/r/niggerjailbait, &amp;nbsp;/r/picsofdeadjailbait, and a whole &lt;a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/brendanklinkenberg/reddit-bans-racist-subreddits\"&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; for anti-black Reddits called the \"Chimpire,\" which flourished on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Moderation silos \" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lomKyoyVc6m5ECj3oRrL8qEzjHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6330671/ericPetersen_silos_RGB_fin.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In the wake of public outrage over CelebGate \u2014 the posting on Reddit of hacked private photos of more than 100 women celebrities \u2014 a &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QJBPZt0oa3UCkL6QGBHp6vITXs3f1bYcCyA5xIQcFZw/pub#h.gcq3lpkbcrfv\"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of more than 16,000 Redditors found that 50 percent of those who wouldn\u2019t recommend Reddit cited \"hateful or offensive content or community\" as the reason why. After the survey was published in March 2015, the company announced, \"we are seeing our open policies stifling free expression; people avoid participating for fear of their personal and family safety.\" Alexis Ohanian, a Reddit co-founder, and other members of the Reddit team, described the company\u2019s slow response to CelebGate as \"a missed chance to be a leader\" on the issue of moderating nonconsensual pornography. Two months later, Reddit published one of its first corporate anti-harassment moderation policies, which prohibited revenge porn and encouraged users to email moderators with concerns. Reddit includes a report feature that is routed anonymously to volunteer moderators whose ability to act on posts is &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moderation\"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; in detail on the site.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene13\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle1\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style1\"&gt;Alexis Ohanian described Reddit\u2019s slow response to CelebGate as \"a missed chance to be a leader.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;But the survey also laid bare the philosophical clash between the site\u2019s commitment to open expression, which fueled early growth, and the desire for limits among the users who may fuel future growth: 35 percent of complaints from \"extremely dissatisfied users\" were due to \"heavy handed moderation and censorship.\" The company continues to grapple with the paradox that to expand, Reddit (and other platforms) will likely have to regulate speech in ways that alienate a substantive percentage of their core customer base.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When asked in the summer of 2015 about racist subreddits that remained in place despite the company\u2019s new policies, CEO Steve Huffman said the content is \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/nothing-changes-at-reddit#.ypO2dzgv8\"&gt;offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning&lt;/a&gt;,\" and &lt;a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/nothing-changes-at-reddit#.rdaWGZrbp\"&gt;clarified&lt;/a&gt; that the changes were not \"an official update to our policy.\" By then, as &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; tech columnist David Auerbach &lt;a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/07/hate_speech_on_reddit_a_simple_novel_plan_to_quarantine_it.html\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, Reddit was widely seen as \"a cesspool of hate in dire need of repair.\" Within weeks, Reddit &lt;a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2015/08/05/reddits-new-content-policy-g.html\"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the removal of a list of racist and other \"communities that exist solely to annoy other Redditors, [and] prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The sharp contrast between Facebook, with its robust and long-standing Safety Advisory Board, and Reddit, with its skeletal staff and dark pools of offensive content, offers up a vivid illustration for how content moderation has evolved in isolated ways within individual corporate enclaves. The fragmentation means that content banned on one platform can simply pop up on another, and that trolling can be coordinated so that harassment and abuse that appear minor on a single platform are amplified by appearing simultaneously on multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;A writer who goes by Erica Munnings and asked that we not use her real name out of fear of retaliation, found herself on the receiving end of one such attack, which she describes as a \"high-consequence game of whack-a-mole across multiple social media platforms for days and weeks.\" After writing a feminist article that elicited conservative backlash, a five-day \"Twitter-flogging\" ensued. From there, the attacks moved to Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, and 4chan. Self-appointed task forces of Reddit and 4chan users published her address and flooded her professional organization with emails, demanding that her professional license be rescinded. She shut down comments on her YouTube videos. She logged off Twitter. On Facebook, the harassment was debilitating. To separate her personal and professional lives, she had set up a separate Facebook page for her business. However, user controls on such pages are thin, and her attackers found their way in. \"I couldn\u2019t get one-star reviews removed or make the choice as a small business not to have \u2018Reviews\u2019 on my page at all,\" she said. \"Policies like this open the floodgates of internet hate and tied my hands behind my back. There was no way I could report each and every attack across multiple social media platforms because they came at me so fast and in such high volume. But also, it became clear to me that when I did report, no one responded, so there really was no incentive to keep reporting. That became yet another costly time-sink on top of deleting comments, blocking people, and screen-grabbing everything for my own protection. Because no one would help me, I felt I had no choice but to wait it out, which cost me business, and income.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Several content moderation experts point to Pinterest as an industry leader. Microsoft\u2019s Tarleton Gillespie, author of the forthcoming &lt;em&gt;Free Speech in the Age of Platform&lt;/em&gt;, says the company is likely doing the most of any social media company to bridge the divide between platform and user, private company and the public. The platform\u2019s moderation staff is well-funded and supported, and Pinterest is reportedly breaking ground in making its processes transparent to users. For example, &lt;a href=\"https://about.pinterest.com/en/acceptable-use-policy\"&gt;Pinterest posts visual examples&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the site\u2019s \"acceptable use policy\" in an effort to help users better understand the platform\u2019s content guidelines and the decisions moderators make to uphold them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene14\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle2\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style2\"&gt;In response to the film 'Fifty Shades of Grey', Pinterest was hustling to develop new BDSM standards&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When we met with Charlotte Willner, now Pinterest\u2019s Safety Manager, the film &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt; had just been released. She and her team were hustling to develop new BDSM standards. \"We realized,\" she later explained by email, \"that we were going to need to figure out standards for rape and kidnapping fantasy content, which we hadn\u2019t seen a lot of but we began to see in connection with the general BDSM influx.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The calls were not easy, but it was clear that her team was making decisions on a remarkably granular level. One user was posting fetish comments about cooking Barbie-size women in a stew pot. Should this be allowed? Why not? The team had to decipher whether it was an actual threat. A full-size woman can\u2019t fit into stew pot, the team figured, so the content was unlikely to cause real-world harm. Ultimately, they let the posts stand \u2014 that is, according to Willner, until the \"stew pot guy\" began uploading more explicit content that clearly violated Pinterest\u2019s terms and her team removed his account.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;On that same South by Southwest panel, Rosen expressed concerns about both corporate regulation of free speech and newly stringent European Union regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten. \"Censorship rules that have a lower standard than the First Amendment are too easily abused by governments,\" he said. Yet he offered some warm words of praise, saying that companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter are \"trying to thread an incredibly delicate and difficult line\" and \"the balance that they\u2019re striking is a sensible one\" given the pressures they face. He added, \"Judges and regulators and even really smart, wonderful Google lawyers\" are doing \"about as good of a job with this unwelcome task as could be imagined.\" It was a striking remark, given Google\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/elatable/status/706921780422660096\"&gt;confirmation&lt;/a&gt;, only days earlier, that it had hired controversial 4chan founder Christopher Poole. Prominent industry critic Shanley Kane &lt;a href=\"https://modelviewculture.com/news/google-hires-4chan-founder-sends-huge-fuck-you-to-marginalized-users\"&gt;penned&lt;/a&gt; an outraged post describing Poole as responsible \"for a decade + of inculcating one of the most vile, violent and harmful \u2018communities\u2019 on the Internet.\" For marginalized groups, she wrote, the decision \"sends not only a \u2018bad message,\u2019 but a giant \u2018fuck you.\u2019\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr class=\"roots_div4\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;p class=\"pt-dropcap\"&gt;Several sources told us that industry insiders, frustrated by their isolation, have begun moving independently of their employers. Dave Willner, and others who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told us that 20 or 30 people working in moderation have started meeting occasionally for dinner in San Francisco to talk informally about their work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;One front-line expert, Jennifer Puckett, has worked in moderation for more than 15 years and now serves as social reputation manager heading up the Digital Safety Team at &lt;a href=\"http://www.emoderation.com/the-company/\"&gt;Emoderation&lt;/a&gt;. She believes that moderation, as an industry, is maturing. On the one hand, the human expertise is growing, making that tableful of young college grads at YouTube seem quaint. \"People are forming their college studies around these types of jobs,\" Mora-Blanco says. \"The industry has PhD candidates in internship roles.\" On the other hand, efforts to automate moderation have also advanced.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Growing numbers of researchers are developing technology tooled to understand user-generated content, with companies hawking unique and proprietary analytics and algorithms that attempt to measure meaning and predict behavior. &lt;a href=\"http://www.datanami.com/2016/02/09/big-data-and-the-race-to-be-president/\"&gt;Adaptive Listening technologies&lt;/a&gt;, which are increasingly capable of providing sophisticated analytics of online conversations, are being developed to assess user context and intent.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene15\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle2\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style2\"&gt;\"If the moderation system is a factory, this approach moves what is essentially piecework toward assembly.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In May 2014, Dave Willner and Dan Kelmenson, a software engineer at Facebook, patented a &lt;a href=\"http://www.google.com.gh/patents/US20080256602\"&gt;3D-modeling technology&lt;/a&gt; for content moderation designed around a system that resembles an industrial assembly line. \"It\u2019s tearing the problem [of huge volume] into pieces to make chunks more comprehensible,\" Willner says. First, the model identifies a set of malicious groups \u2014 say neo-Nazis, child pornographers, or rape promoters. The model then identifies users who associate with those groups through their online interactions. Next, the model searches for other groups associated with those users and analyzes those groups \"based on occurrences of keywords associated with the type of malicious activity and manual verification by experts.\" This way, companies can identify additional or emerging malicious online activity. \"If the moderation system is a factory, this approach moves what is essentially piecework toward assembly,\" he said. \"And you can measure how good the system is.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Working with Microsoft, Hany Farid, the chair of Computer Science at Dartmouth College, developed something called PhotoDNA, which allows tech companies to automatically detect, remove, and report the presence of child exploitation images on their networks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When we spoke, Farid described the initial resistance to PhotoDNA, how industry insiders said the problem of child exploitation was too hard to solve. &lt;em&gt;Yes, it\u2019s horrible&lt;/em&gt;, he recalled everyone \u2014 executives, attorneys, engineers \u2014 saying, &lt;em&gt;but there\u2019s so much content&lt;/em&gt;. Civil liberties groups, he recalls, also balked at an automated moderation system.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Talk to those people today, he said, and they\u2019ll tell you how successful PhotoDNA has been. PhotoDNA works by processing an image every two milliseconds and is highly accurate. First, he explains, known child exploitation images are identified by NCMEC. Then PhotoDNA extracts from each image a numeric signature that is unique to that image, \"like your human DNA is to you.\" Whenever an image is uploaded, whether to Facebook or Tumblr or Twitter, and so on, he says, \"its photoDNA is extracted and compared to our known CE images. Matches are automatically detected by a computer and reported to NCMEC for a follow-up investigation.\" He describes photoDNA as \"agnostic,\" saying, \"There is nothing specific to child exploitation in the technology.\" He could just as easily be looking for pictures of cats. The tricky part of content moderation is not identifying content, he says, but the \"long, hard conversations\" \u2014 conducted by humans, not machines \u2014 necessary for reaching the tough decisions about what constitutes personal or political speech. Farid is now working with tech companies and nonprofit groups to develop similar technology that will identify extremism and terrorist threats online \u2014 whether expressed in speech, image, video, or audio. He expects the program to launch within months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;While tech solutions are rapidly emerging, the cultural ones are slower in coming. Emily Laidlaw, assistant professor of law at University of Calgary and author of &lt;em&gt;Regulating Speech in Cyberspace&lt;/em&gt;, calls for \"a clarification of the applicability of existing laws.\" For starters, she says, Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act needs immediate overhaul. Companies, she argues, should no longer be entirely absolved of liability for the content they host.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;center&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Moderation factory\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMSkMiTuMrx01bOd32jpDnmv8Yc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6330679/ericPetersen_factory_RGB_fin.0.jpg\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;/center&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For more than five years, Harvard\u2019s Berkman Center for Internet and Society has pushed for industry-wide best practices. Their recommendations include corporate transparency, consistency, clarity, and a mechanism for customer recourse. Other civil society advocates &lt;a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Business/A-HRC-17-31_AEV.pdf\"&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; for corporate grievance mechanisms that are accessible and transparent in accordance with international human rights law, or call on corporations to engage in public dialogue with such active stakeholders as the Anti Defamation League, the Digital Rights Foundation, and the National Network to End Domestic Violence. \"What we do is informed by external conversations that we have,\" explained Facebook\u2019s Bickert in early March. \"Every day, we are in conversations with groups around the world\u2026 So, while we are responsible for overseeing these policies and managing them, it is really a global conversation.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene16\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle1\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style1\"&gt;\"We have one set of content standards for the entire world.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Some large established companies like YouTube, Pinterest, Emoderation, Facebook, and Twitter are beginning to make headway in improving moderation practices, using both tech and human solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In the eight months since CEO Dick Costolo\u2019s departure, Twitter has reached out to users and advocates in an effort to be more responsive. In early February, Patricia Cartes, Twitter\u2019s head of global policy outreach, &lt;a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2016/announcing-the-twitter-trust-safety-council\"&gt;announced the formation of a Trust &amp;amp; Safety Council&lt;/a&gt;, a multidisciplinary advisory board comprised of 40 organizations and experts. Still, members of bodies such as this one, and Facebook\u2019s Safety Advisory Board, established in 2009, operate under NDAs, meaning the conversations taking place in these places remain behind-the-scenes. In 2010, Google founded Google Ideas (now Jigsaw), a multi-disciplinary think tank to tackle challenges associated with defending against global security threats and protecting vulnerable populations. Meanwhile, a virtual cottage industry of internet helplines the world over has cropped up, such as Zo\u00eb Quinn\u2019s Crash Override Network, an online abuse helpline for schools and \"revenge porn\" hotlines in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;As these policy debates move forward in private, platforms are also taking steps to protect their front-line moderation workers. Medina told us that representatives from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and Kik have recently attended SHIFT\u2019s resilience trainings. Facebook\u2019s hundreds of moderators \u2014 located in Menlo Park, Austin, Dublin, and Hyderabad \u2014 says Silver, head of Facebook\u2019s Community Support Team, now receive regular training, detailed manuals, counseling and other support. The company brings on experts or trains specialists in specific areas such as suicide, human trafficking, child exploitation, violence against women, and terrorism. Moderator decisions on reported pieces of content are regularly audited, she says, to ensure that moderation is consistent and accurately reflects guidelines. \"We have one set of content standards for the entire world,\" explains Facebook\u2019s Bickert. \"This helps our community be truly global, because it allows people to share content across borders. At the same time, maintaining one set of standards is challenging because people around the world may have different ideas about what is appropriate to share on the Internet.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Many US-based companies, however, continue to consign their moderators to the margins, shipping their platforms\u2019 digital waste to \"special economic zones\" in the Global South. As Roberts recounts in her paper \"Digital Refuse,\" these toxic images trace the same routes used to export the industrial world\u2019s physical waste \u2014 hospital hazardous refuse, dirty adult diapers, and old model computers. Without visible consequences here and largely unseen, companies dump child abuse and pornography, crush porn, animal cruelty, acts of terror, and executions \u2014 images so extreme those paid to view them won\u2019t even describe them in words to their loved ones \u2014 onto people desperate for work. And there they sit in crowded rooms at call centers, or alone, working off-site behind their screens and facing cyber-reality, as it is being created. Meanwhile, each new startup begins the process, essentially, all over again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene17\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left sstyle2\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center style2\"&gt;Meanwhile, each new startup begins the process, essentially, all over again&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;And even industry leaders continue to rely on their users to report and flag unacceptable content. This reliance, &lt;a href=\"http://boundary2.org/2015/12/16/dewandre-on-pascal/\"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nicole Dewandre, an &lt;a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/nicole-dewandre-biography%E2%80%A6.can\"&gt;advisor&lt;/a&gt; to the European Commission on &amp;nbsp;Information and Communication Technology policy, is \"an exhausting laboring activity that does not deliver on accountability.\" The principle of &lt;a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/project/counter-speech/\"&gt;counter speech&lt;/a&gt;, by which users are expected to actively contradict hateful or harmful messages, firmly puts the burdens and risks of action on users, not on the money-making platforms who depend on their content. Perhaps for that reason, counter speech has become an industry buzzword. Susan Benesch, founder of the &lt;a href=\"http://dangerousspeech.org/\"&gt;Dangerous Speech Project&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks inflammatory speech and its effects, notes that while counter speech is an important tool, \"it cannot be the sole solution. We don\u2019t yet understand enough about when it\u2019s effective, and can often put the counter-speaker at risk of attack, online or offline.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Sarah T. Roberts, the researcher, cautions that \"we can\u2019t lose sight of the baseline.\" The platforms, she notes, \"are soliciting content. It\u2019s their solicitation that invites people to upload content. They create the outlet and the impetus.\" If moderators are, in Dave Willner\u2019s estimation, platforms\u2019 emotional laborers, users are, in the words of labor researcher &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;text=Kylie+Jarrett&amp;amp;search-alias=books&amp;amp;field-author=Kylie+Jarrett&amp;amp;sort=relevancerank\"&gt;Kylie Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;, their \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Labour-Digital-Media-Cyberculture/dp/1138855790\"&gt;digital housewives&lt;/a&gt;\" &amp;nbsp;\u2014 volunteering their time and adding value to the system while remaining unpaid and invisible, compensated only through affective benefits. The question, now, is how can the public leverage the power inherent in this role? Astra Taylor, author of &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/books/review/the-peoples-platform-by-astra-taylor.html?_r=0\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The People\u2019s Platform&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says, \"I\u2019m struck by the fact that we use these civic-minded metaphors, calling Google Books a \u2018library\u2019 or Twitter a \u2018town square\u2019 \u2014 or even calling social media \u2018social\u2019 \u2014 but real public options are off the table, at least in the United States.\" Though users are responsible for providing and policing vast quantities of digital content, she points out, we then \"hand the digital commons over to private corporations at our own peril.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr class=\"roots_div3\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;p class=\"pt-dropcap\"&gt;On January 19th, 2015, Mora-Blanco packed up her desk and left Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;From her last position in Public Policy, she no longer had to screen violent images day after day and, after months of laying groundwork, she told us, \"things had started to shift and move along lines I\u2019d always wanted.\" She and her coworkers \u2014 from Legal, Safety, Support, Public Policy, Content \"all the pieces of the puzzle all across the platform\" \u2014 had started meeting weekly to tackle online harassment and threat. \"We got to sit in the room together,\" she said, \"and everyone felt really connected and that we could move forward together.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;But she\u2019d finally earned enough money to take a year to train as a hair stylist.

Needless to say, it\u2019s an interesting time to be in his position: even as Ford and other automakers come off a record year for sales, there\u2019s an awful lot of scary writing on the wall. Car-sharing, ride-sharing, Apple cars, Google cars, and Teslas \u2014 just to name a few \u2014 pose a perfect storm of existential threats that Detroit has never had to deal with before. Not quite like this, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But recognizing a threat to the business is entirely different from effectively dealing with it. Can Ford course-correct enough to turn its disruption into a new revenue stream? \u201cOur approach is to first disrupt ourselves,\u201d he says during the course of our recent interview.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The line sounds like a talking point from a well-rehearsed presentation, and it is \u2014 Fields has been saying variations of it both on and off stage since he took over in 2014, famously &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7501801/ford-is-testing-ways-to-help-you-not-buy-a-car\"&gt;announcing a slew of projects at his CES 2015 keynote&lt;/a&gt; that had very little to do with selling more cars. And by all appearances, it\u2019s not just lip service: Ford recently &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/11/11201870/ford-smart-mobility-llc-ride-share-car-share-self-driving\"&gt;spun off its next-generation mobility initiatives into a wholly owned subsidiary&lt;/a&gt;, Ford Smart Mobility LLC, with operations centered in Palo Alto. That\u2019s a long, long way from Ford headquarters in Dearborn. (2,421 miles, to be exact.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat down with Fields to discuss the spin-off, the state of his business, and what it means for the 113-year-old Ford Motor Company to exist in a post-car world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\n&lt;q&gt;\"We didn\u2019t want to overlay [Smart Mobility] with the Ford bureaucracy.\"&lt;/q&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Ziegler: Tell me more about the spin-off. I think it\u2019s a really fascinating move, and it speaks to how seriously you\u2019ve been taking this stuff. But tell me more about the real benefits of this. What does it buy you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mark Fields: I think a couple of things. As we\u2019ve been thinking about this and we\u2019ve described it to our organization and externally, loving our core business \u2014 designing, developing, manufacturing, and building great cars, trucks, and SUVs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Well, then we have these emerging opportunities in mobility services. We want to aggressively go after that. The point we\u2019ve been making is that it\u2019s not moving from an old business to a new business. It\u2019s just moving to a bigger business as we expand the business model from number of units sold to number of units sold plus vehicle miles traveled. We\u2019ve been thinking through, how do you structure that? Because there are lots of case studies of companies that have made completely different companies, but they\u2019re so divorced from the core business that you never get the cross-pollination that you need to make one plus one equal three.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are other cases where they make it a division in the existing business. And guess what happens? It gets killed. Because in the scheme of investment priorities, you\u2019ll always be able to prove out the core business before you\u2019ll be able to prove out some of these mobility services. Many times you have to scale. You have to build a customer base and you have to scale it. It could be a different time frame as the business gets to a level of acceptable profitability.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So we decided to create a subsidiary, so we created Ford Smart Mobility LLC. It does a couple of things. First, the way to think about it is, you know, we have Ford Credit. Ford Credit is a subsidiary of Ford. Their role is to help support the core business. Ford Smart Mobility, their role is to design, develop, build, invest, and grow these mobility services. That can not only become a business on its own, but also help support the core business. Because, guess what, a lot of these services, they need vehicles. Right?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You want it separate but connected. The reason we wanted to do it separate is because, you have to realize that we needed to give them the flexibility and the operating structure to be able to be competitive with other technology and mobility services companies that move really fast. We didn\u2019t want to overlay them with the Ford bureaucracy. The reason we have that bureaucracy or those processes in the core business is, listen, it\u2019s a complex product, it\u2019s got to be safe, regulated, all of those kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a method there, and [reasons] why we have those processes of governance in place. You can do it a little differently and make it a little more agile, if it was separate. On top of it we\u2019ve taken one of our board members, Jim Hackett, who ran Steelcase for 20 years, and we\u2019ve taken him off the board to be chairman of Ford Smart Mobility. Importantly, he reports directly to me because it has to have top-down sponsorship. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not going to be able to be as effective as it will on its own, without having that sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What Jim did in Steelcase over 20 years, he helped change the way people work \u2014 the old death-by-cubicle approach that it was in the '60s. If you look at many of the workplaces today, Jim helped think through that and implement that at Steelcase. We\u2019re asking Jim to again help think through how we help people be mobile, and change the way the world moves.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re going to hire a CEO, they will be based in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nilay Patel: The whole division?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, the organization. There will be some distributed groups but the main nucleus of it is going to be in Silicon Valley. The main reason for that is couple-fold. One, it\u2019s not just because the talent is in Silicon Valley, the whole ecosystem there. It\u2019s a community of ideas. When you\u2019re viewed as a part of a community you get a lot of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"It\u2019s not just because the talent is in Silicon Valley, the whole ecosystem there.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We are already seeing that with our Research and Innovation Center that we set up over a year ago. We now have over 120 professionals. It\u2019s going to grow to maybe 160 by mid-year. Many of the projects that we\u2019ve put in place, things that we\u2019re doing for example, &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10711914/ford-smart-home-connectivity\"&gt;with Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/4/10708140/dji-ford-rescue-drone-competition-united-nations-un-ces-2016\"&gt;things we\u2019re doing with DJI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That came about by just being in the community there. Another reason is that you want to put it in a place where mobility is a problem. Necessity is the mother of invention, and when you\u2019re living that every single day, you\u2019re coming up with ideas. To put this thing in, let\u2019s say, Dearborn, it wouldn\u2019t be as effective.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CZ: Could you see this LLC serving other automakers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;No. We want it to be dedicated to Ford. As we said, we want to build out our business model on this. It\u2019s not moving from an old business to a new business, just a &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; business. They\u2019re interconnected. The way we pictorially show this is through an infinity symbol. We have the core over here and we have Ford Smart Mobility over here, to make the point the one can help reinforce the other.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Are you going to want them to design cars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: This seems like a big piece of the puzzle that\u2019s missing, right? If they\u2019re just doing mobility services, you can swap in Camrys and they would still be able to move people around.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Right. Well, what we want to do is make sure that we maintain the integrity of our core business in terms of the design and development process. But we may see \u2014 for example, as we get into investigating transportation as a service, and we get into autonomous vehicle transportation as a service \u2014 that they will provide some great feedback to the product development team, and take that into account as we\u2019re developing our vehicles. Because in some cases we\u2019ve been very focused on: is it fun to drive? We\u2019ll have to inject an approach of fun to ride. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;\n  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"ford-autonomous-fusion-01\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7DDGq4amtN0_yHiD2StYM4MN4PE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6291375/160106_TWN_Autonomous__2_.0.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;An autonomous Fusion outside Ford's R&amp;amp;D facility in Palo Alto, California. (Ford)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CZ: What happens when Travis [Kalanick] comes and says, \"I want 100,000 Explorers with this option deleted, and the rear seats reconfigured this way\"? Do you say yes? Does that conflict with your LLC? What is that relationship like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This will evolve over time. We talk with everybody, and if that\u2019s the case, and if that particular hypothetical came about, we would always have a discussion. First off, it has to make business sense. Anything that we do, we want to make sure that it does two things. One is, it builds our brand. And secondly, it creates value for the company.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Tell me about the Ford line right now. Ford is a classic American car company, you\u2019re like master of the universe, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn\u2019t say that. [&lt;i&gt;Laughs&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;q&gt;\"We're still a family company.\"&lt;/q&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: I mean, you\u2019re the CEO of a major American car maker. In this moment you need to change what that brand represents, particularly with younger people. What kind of process are you going through, what\u2019s the process you\u2019re going through with your brand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As you look at our company, we are going through this transition of being an auto company, and a mobility company. First off, it\u2019s making sure that when you look at what our brand stands for, it\u2019s pretty timeless. We\u2019re a brand that\u2019s known for our accessibility. We\u2019re a brand that\u2019s known for our ingenuity and innovation. We\u2019re also a human brand. What I mean by that is, we\u2019re still a family company. We\u2019re a brand that\u2019s recognized around the world consistently. We don\u2019t have different brands in different parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As we go forward, we want to be viewed from all customers, and young customers in particular as having great products that have great technology, great safety, great fuel efficiency, et cetera. But also we want to be known as a brand that will help people be mobile. Mobility for us \u2014 when we say a mobility company, we mean mobility at its highest level. The definition is allowing people to live, play, and work where they want. How do we play a role in making that happen?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: What you\u2019re saying, then, is that you want to be known as a tech company. I think last year you were saying \"we have to be a software company.\"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You know, when I first joined the company, a long time ago, we were a manufacturing company. As we go forward, I want us to be known as a manufacturing, a technology, and an information company. Because as our vehicles become a part of the Internet of Things, and as consumers choose to share their data with us, we want to be able to use that data to help make their lives better. And also, create some business models that will help us earn a return. That\u2019s where we\u2019re heading.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;q&gt;\"As consumers choose to share their data with us, we want to be able to use that data to help make their lives better.\"&lt;/q&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Again, it\u2019s making sure that when you look at the skill sets that we have in the company, I want our engineering teams and our marketers thinking about how we\u2019re creating experiences. For many years we focused on just the technology. Just driving towards the technology has its dangers. If you just have the engineering teams focusing on just the technologies and then piecing them together to figure out how to deliver an experience, it\u2019s very different. Now flip that on its head and say, \"what experiences do we want to give our customers?\" \u2014 and then ask how do technology, hardware, and software actually enable that.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As we go forward, we are going to be becoming more and more skilled at software, and adding capability around that. We have a lot of software skills right now, around engine controls, calibration, communication, and entertainment technology \u2014 you know, Sync, electrification.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But we have to think more broadly around how we create real relationships with our consumers through our products and also through another thing we're introducing, &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/11/10743122/ford-fordpass-detroit-auto-show-2016\"&gt;FordPass&lt;/a&gt;. In technology companies they talk about the platform, and then you need to make sure if you want to be successful, that any services that you create need to be tightly bound to the platform. Our platform is the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One of the things that we announced earlier this year is FordPass, which is basically our way of reimagining the relationship between our consumers, an ongoing relationship. It has a number of different elements with it. We want FordPass to do for the auto industry what iTunes did for the music industry. It\u2019s a set of digital, physical, and also mobility experiences, where we integrate into people\u2019s lives. A number of them will be powered by a Ford app.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"Our platform is the vehicle.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll be able to do things like, not only reserve parking \u2014 you\u2019ll get smart parking, eventually have ride-sharing off it. You\u2019ll also be able to pay your Ford credit bill, or use what we call FordPay. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re going through a drive-through, and instead of taking your wallet out, your vehicle will know that it\u2019s you, and you\u2019ll be able to pick up your McDonald\u2019s and will get billed through FordPay. It\u2019s about making people\u2019s lives easier, and using the vehicle as a platform, and then generating some services off of that.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: So does FordPass extend to not owning a car?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Because that\u2019s an entirely new business model for you, right? Can you push your brand there, that\u2019s the real question. Are you going to get Chevy owners to live in a Ford ecosystem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I think we have a great opportunity to do that. Plus, if you think about urban areas, you don\u2019t own a car, right? Because it\u2019s too expensive, but you need to be able to get around town.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A part of the beauty of the FordPass is that it will provide mobility solutions for you in the city. Multimodal, right? You\u2019ll be able to maybe take a ride-sharing car to a certain part of the city and maybe take an electric bike the last mile, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I\u2019d love people to say, \"I\u2019m going to take the Ford,\" but it\u2019s interpreted in a different way, a nontraditional way, than just a hard and fast property.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: So there\u2019s a real tension there. We talk about this all the time because it\u2019s what our readers are saying to us, which is, we just want to get in a car, we don\u2019t want to see Sync, we just want to look at Android Auto, CarPlay. We already have a platform, we just want the car to be an extension of whatever kind of platform we like. How do you resolve that tension? Are you just going to keep going on Sync or are you\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Well no, Sync is very important. Our approach is, first off, we want to be consumer-centric around here. And, you\u2019re right, there\u2019s a lot of customers, they love their iPhones, they love their Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;\n  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"ford-bridj-01\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9zH-ce-TQGDefCyGMnNanTieZhE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6291391/Ride-KC-Bridj-Transit-back-angle.0.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;One of Ford's recent mobility projects is RideKC: Bridj, an on-demand bus service in Kansas City. (Ford)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Which kind of phone do you have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The [iPhone] 6. My whole family has it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: You\u2019re locked in iMessage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And FaceTime, and all of that other kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: The ultimate platform lock in. I see what you\u2019re doing! [&lt;i&gt;Laughs&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Again, we\u2019re trying to think like a software company. How do we make it so sticky that consumers love dealing with us, but then, the switching costs are really high? I don\u2019t mean switching cost in terms of money. Just switching cost in terms of, \"you know, I\u2019ve got everything here, it\u2019s convenient, I\u2019m not going to have the aggravation of trying to change things out.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;q&gt;\"We saw what happened to the handset makers. We're determined to make sure that doesn't happen.\"&lt;/q&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When you think about being consumer-centric, we want to give people the opportunity that if they want to bring their smartphone interface into the vehicle, they can. That doesn\u2019t mean that we cede the in-vehicle experience. In terms of operating HVAC, other systems within the vehicle, we want to make sure that we have a Ford taste to that. At the same time, be agnostic and allow people to take things in as they want. That\u2019s the approach here. Our approach is not to turn our vehicles into handsets. We saw what happened to the handset makers. We\u2019re determined to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Well, if Apple is building a car right next to you\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: How do you look at those upstarts, how do you look at Tesla, and rumors of Apple building a car? I keep coming back to this idea of the brand, right? They have classically disruptive brands, and that\u2019s just their story. \"We\u2019re going to ruin everything. Then we\u2019ll take it over from the ashes.\" How do you see those kinds of brands?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our approach is to first, disrupt ourselves. That\u2019s why you see us creating things like Ford Smart Mobility, the LLC, creating FordPass, really thinking differently about this from a consumer-end standpoint. Thinking about experiences, and then how does technology, hardware, and software deliver that, as opposed to the other way around. I think we\u2019re really disrupting ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Who knows what Apple is going to do? Our working assumption should be, they\u2019re doing a car, it\u2019s going to have a great user interface, it\u2019s going to be connected seamlessly to the cloud. That motivates us even more as a company, to make sure that we push the company forward in a lot of these different areas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CZ: What\u2019s interesting is that I\u2019ve heard a number of auto executives at this point say, if Apple is making a car, they should strongly reconsider because it\u2019s not a good business to get into.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I think our business is pretty good. We made record operating profits last year. One billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CZ: Absolutely, but is it \"peak car?\" Is that feeding into your decision to spin-off the LLC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;No, what is actually prompting us to develop our Ford Smart Mobility strategy is that we\u2019re looking at societal trends, right? Any business needs to take a point of view of the future. I\u2019m not talking next month, five, ten, fifteen years out. We\u2019re looking at some societal trends.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re looking at the growth of the megacities, 10 million or more people, lots of congestion. We\u2019re looking at the growth of the global middle class. What is the first thing you do when you get in the middle class? \"I want to buy a car, because I want to connote that I\u2019ve made it.\" More congestion. We look at things like pollution, which used to be an issue around the environment, now it\u2019s issues around basic health in certain cities around the world. We look at changing consumer buying behaviors, particularly millennials in urban areas. They want access versus ownership.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re looking at that world, and saying, \"gosh, those are societal trends, what does that mean for our business?\" It doesn\u2019t mean our point of view of the world in the future is that the world is just going to be roaming with autonomous vehicles and you just hit a button on your smartphone and it\u2019s going to show up. It\u2019s going to be a spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"Who knows what Apple is going to do?\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s going to be folks who continue to shop, buy, own, and drive vehicles the way they have, for many, many years. That\u2019s why it\u2019s really important for us to focus on growing our core.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, particularly in urban areas, these opportunities around mobility services are going to become greater and greater. And the business rationale is, our current core business, if you add up all the OEMs around the world, the car makers, and the revenue, it\u2019s about 2.3 trillion dollars a year. We get about 6 percent of that. If you expand that to transportation services, you know, money that people spend on taxis and car-sharing and ride-sharing and insurance, and that kind of stuff \u2014 put aside plane rides \u2014 that\u2019s about a $5.4 trillion business a year. We get none of that, and neither does the rest of our industry. Even if we get a small piece of that, that\u2019s additional to the company! That\u2019s the business opportunity in front of us, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking at this as a big opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CZ: To get there you need a strong presence in electrification, which granted, you do, you have a lot of hybrids out there, and a couple EVs as well\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And we\u2019ve made a big commitment over the next five years to invest in over four and a half billion dollars in electrified vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Are you going to make an electric Mustang? [&lt;i&gt;Laughs&lt;/i&gt;]&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/1/8320189/zombie-222-electric-car-1968-mustang-texas-mile\"&gt;Did you see the story of that, on the all electric \u201967&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: You should go for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Low end torque\u2019s pretty good\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CZ: It\u2019s not a joke though. Tesla\u2019s eating everyone\u2019s lunch. The P90D is just insanely quick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But, put it into perspective. Tesla has done a very nice job of raising awareness of electrified vehicles. They cater to a high-end consumer, where the Tesla is usually their second, third, or fourth vehicle. It\u2019s not their only vehicle. Our approach has been to give consumers the power choice, whether plug-in hybrids or overall electrified vehicles, and be true to our brand and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CZ: Tesla is about to not be for the high-end customer, right? It feels like between &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/31/11335272/tesla-model-3-announced-price-release-date-specs-preorder\"&gt;the Model 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10722996/chevrolet-bolt-electric-car-first-drive-ces-2016\"&gt;the Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, they\u2019re kind of sucking the air out of the room, maybe unfairly because there are a lot of EVs in the space. The Leaf is up to 150 miles of range, I think. There\u2019s a Focus Electric out there. At what point do you put a 200-plus-mile range, affordable EV on the road? It has to be on your roadmap.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, that\u2019s part of the four and a half billion dollars that we\u2019re investing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CZ: So, you\u2019re getting there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. We\u2019re building on the experience that we\u2019ve had with the electrified vehicles that we do have on the marketplace. The other thing is, at a certain point, this automotive business is a business that requires a lot of capital. You\u2019ve got to make money at something, okay? [&lt;i&gt;Laughs&lt;/i&gt;] You\u2019ve got to generate positive cash.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"mark-fields-james-bareham-01\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EynbgpXrBJwmiiWKUPMvyK0JOSQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6289437/jbareham_160322_0986_0075.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: You going to build a car for Google and generate some positive cash?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You know, we talk with everybody, I know that rumor was out there but we\u2019re not going to get into\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: I was looking forward to that. That was going to be the best story at CES. All we got &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/4/10711164/faraday-future-ffzero1-concept-car-announced-photos-ces-2016\"&gt;was Faraday doing nothing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But talk to me about self driving. There is the vision of the future, where people don\u2019t own cars, the F-150 isn\u2019t the best selling car in the world every quarter for 100 years\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes it will be! [&lt;i&gt;Laughs&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Five years from now is the F-150 still the best selling car in the world?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Ten years from now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Why\u2019s that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When you look at the F-150, most people are using that to do a job. It\u2019s a tool for them. Tradespeople, et cetera. Yeah, there are some personal-use buyers, but it\u2019s a purpose-built vehicle, it\u2019s a tool. You\u2019re going to take that tool away from people? You\u2019re going to take it away from the tradesmen, the farmers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We don\u2019t get arrogant about it and say, \"that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be.\" We look at a lot of data. When you look at that the full-sized pickup segment, and the jobs, you always have to look at, what is the job of the vehicles you bring out? It\u2019s a very specific job for our trucks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: There\u2019s that side of it. But there is the \"I don\u2019t want a car anymore, I just push a button and the robot drives me around.\"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: How are you going to get into that game? Are you going to do self-driving?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our strategy is two-fold. The term autonomous vehicle is really thrown about liberally these days and I bet if you asked five different people, you\u2019d get five different answers. Everything from \"I hit a button I end up at Grandma\u2019s house\" to \"it helps me stay in my lane\" or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s levels zero through five. Level zero through three is where the driver has to always be prepared to take control of the vehicle, or full-time control. For example, level zero is things like blind-spot detection. The light comes on, notifies you, you have to move the vehicle. Level one is adaptive cruise control. Level two is, we\u2019re bringing out a feature in the next year or two called traffic jam assist. You sit in the West Side Highway near traffic; push a button and the vehicle will control the braking, the acceleration, and the steering for you, in that environment. Level three is like the Tesla Autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"Tesla has done a very nice job of raising awareness of electrified vehicles.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In all of those cases the driver needs to be ready to take control at a moment\u2019s notice. Our strategy is to continue to be a leader in semi-autonomous and driver assist features, to make them better drivers, and we have a separate effort working on level four. Level four is, the driver never has to take control. It\u2019s in a defined area that\u2019s been 3D-mapped. Level five is, any area, any weather. That\u2019s a long way away.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We are working very hard on level four. The first applications could be, for example, transportation as a service in an urban area. We are very aggressively working on both of those. Listen, we\u2019ve been working on autonomous vehicles for over 10 years now. We were the only manufacturer that sponsored a [factory-led] team in the original DARPA autonomous vehicle competition back in 2005. We\u2019re working both ends of these.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CZ: GM is saying that they\u2019re pretty convinced that the applications of that type of autonomy, that level of autonomy, are going to be in ride-sharing fleets for the near and medium term. Do you share that view, or do you think there\u2019s a broader opportunity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I think it\u2019ll be a combination. I think probably some of the first applications will be transportation as a service in areas that are mapped out, and getting people used to that. But I also think there will be personal-use applications of that. I think it will be a spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CZ: Will those ride-sharing autonomous cars be run by the LLC or could you sell them to outside providers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We are thinking through all of those things right now. That\u2019s one of the elements of Ford Smart Mobility that we\u2019re thinking through. We\u2019ll talk about what our plans are as we go forward. It could run the gamut to a number of different things, as you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The key is being able to solve a customer need, make their lives easier. What problem are you trying to solve for consumers? Then putting a business model behind that that says you can have a good return based on that.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Last question. It\u2019s 2040.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So I\u2019m six feet under, by the way. Although, no, maybe I\u2019ll still be alive? [&lt;i&gt;Laughs&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Fingers crossed. We\u2019ll be fine. Everything will be better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Ford look like in 2040?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ford looks like an auto and a mobility company that\u2019s known for that. Also, as I think longer term, I want Ford for our customers. Every time they touch Ford, a smile comes on their face. Right? They feel good about it. They want to talk to their friends about it. Our employees, every day they walk in the door, there\u2019s no other place they\u2019d rather walk into. Because they\u2019re not only building great cars and trucks and providing mobility solutions for people, it\u2019s around making people\u2019s lives better. There\u2019s a higher order. That really goes back to our founder Henry Ford, about making people\u2019s lives better.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our employees want their sons and daughters to make their careers at Ford. I want our suppliers to feel like partners, not vendors. I want the government constituents that we work with always looking at us as a trusted source, where they\u2019ll always get a good read on things. That\u2019s a vision for Ford today, that\u2019s a vision for Ford in 2040, and all doing it very ethically. We\u2019ve been named one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies for seven years in a row now by &lt;i&gt;Ethisphere Magazine&lt;/i&gt;. It comes back to people. Particularly young people. They want to come to a place where they can make their dent on the universe. They want to make cool stuff, further their careers, but also come to a company that stands for something.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: That\u2019s a great statement of values. I want to ask way more specifically, in 2040, which side of that infinity sign is bigger? Is it the vehicle manufacturing, or is is the mobility services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I still think that the core side of the business will be the dominant piece but you can see that other piece actually grow pretty significantly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NP: Do you think it will ever overtake the core piece?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I never say never, but probably not in that time frame. But, it could grow significantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;* *&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Original photography by James Bareham&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 8th 10:00AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Mark Fields stated during our interview that Ford was \"the only manufacturer that sponsored a team in the original DARPA autonomous vehicle competition back in 2005.\" Ford later reached out to clarify that other automakers had sponsorships, but Ford was the only one to field a factory-led team.

It was 1994, and Prince Abdul Hakeem, then 20 years old, had inherited two things: access to a $40 billion fortune, and his family\u2019s penchant for spending it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the \u201880s and \u201890s, the monarchs of this tiny, oil-rich nation in the South China Sea bankrolled a fleet of special custom vehicles, ordering the most coveted cars in the world by the half-dozen or more. Their notorious collection \u2014 located in nondescript concrete garages, surrounded by razor wire, and patrolled by armed Nepalese soldiers known as &lt;em&gt;gurkhas&lt;/em&gt; \u2014 numbered in the thousands. Visitors described rows and rows of warehouses, filled to the brim with luxury cars, sometimes organized by make, model, or even color. In &lt;a href=\"https://www.ferraris-online.com/pages/article.php?reqart=SCM_201103_SS\"&gt;his online newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Ferrari broker Michael Sheehan described one floor dedicated solely to black Mercedes SL500s, another to red Ferrari Testarossas, and yet another to bright yellow Bentleys and Lamborghinis. One particularly star-studded showroom included a Ferrari 288 GTO Evo, F40 LM, F50, and three McLaren F1s.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Several of these cars could be found nowhere else in the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Several of the cars in these warehouses were one-of-a-kind, built specifically for Brunei, and could be found nowhere else in the world. For his next order, Prince Hakeem again wanted something special: a Ferrari with a semi-automatic transmission. At the time, the technology didn\u2019t exist on any street-legal vehicle in the world. That didn\u2019t give him any pause. Prince Hakeem was used to getting what he wanted. According to a &lt;a href=\"http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/02/01/254405/index.htm\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; published in 1999, as a teen Prince Hakeem had decided he wanted to learn to play American football, so the Royal Family paid Joe Montana and Herschel Walker to come to Brunei and teach him the game. No one was allowed to tackle the prince, who scored touchdowns every time he touched the ball. On his 18th birthday, he received $1 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For a job like this, Prince Hakeem knew just who to turn to: legendary automotive design house Carozzeria Pininfarina, which had already completed one-off versions of Ferraris, Bentleys, Jaguars, and other historic marques for the Royal Family. It\u2019s estimated that in less than a decade, Pininfarina had built more than 50 cars destined for Brunei.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The assignment came to Paolo Garella, Pininfarina\u2019s prototype manager. Garella\u2019s team would take the Ferrari Testarossa, a pillar of automotive style and performance, and crank up the adrenaline. It was a tall order, but Garella had the experience, talent, and vision necessary for the job.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What Garella\u2019s team built would become one of the most mysterious and compelling supercars ever, one that would come to be known as the Ferrari FX.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"ferrari-fx-Paul Barshon-optimized-jpg-01\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9Gh9mcfkpNgZAcWpE9-J4UqgUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6295437/pbarshon_160316_0982_0O6A4618.0.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Born and raised&lt;/strong&gt; in Italy, Garella knew by age five that he would make cars his life\u2019s work. After seeing the Ferrari Pinin concept \u2014 the first, and still the only four-door Ferrari ever produced \u2014 at the 1980 Torino Auto Show, he committed to becoming an engineer and creating one-of-a-kind designs. He quickly established an enviable career: in the late 1980s, Garella spent five years working at Goodyear, testing prototypes \u2014 like, as luck would have it, the Ferrari Testarossa \u2014 around its famous Circuit de Mireval in France. He then returned to Italy, developing hybrid and electric racecars for PTI Albatech. In 1992 Pininfarina came calling, and Garella became manager of the Prototype Manufacturing and Engineering Department, working on experimental, often top-secret projects. Photos from the \u201890s show him with the pushbroom mustache and wide, round glasses typical of the era \u2014 often, with a beaming smile. Garella was 35 when the FX project came to him, and uniquely qualified to make the prince\u2019s dream car a reality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pininfarina opted for the Ferrari Testarossa as the platform for the new car. With its supercar proportions and mid-engine layout, it was the premiere horse in the Ferrari stable. Having designed the original Testarossa in the early 1980s, Pininfarina was very familiar with the car. In fact, they had already been involved in a custom job based on the Testarossa, called the Ferrari Mythos, a drool-inducing prototype shown at the 1989 Tokyo Motor Show. Ferrari made it clear the Mythos was not for sale. Somehow, two cropped up in the Brunei warehouses anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The only requirement, Garella says, was the semi-automatic transmission&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With the platform chosen, Garella and his team could turn to the task at hand. The only requirement, Garella says, was the semi-automatic transmission. Until then, supercars like the Testarossa almost exclusively featured five- or six-speed manuals. Semi-automatics came from the world of motorsports, where they began appearing in rally cars in the late 1980s, and Formula One cars in the early \u201890s. Instead of relying on the driver to depress the clutch, manually engage a new gear, and then release the clutch before accelerating, the semi-automatic used computers to execute shifts \u2014 with input from the driver via buttons, paddles, or a lever \u2014 in a fraction of the time. Built for quickness and nothing else, semi-automatic transmissions were far too jerky and unrefined for the road in the early 1990s. Pininfarina faced a tall order in adopting one for the FX.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pininfarina turned to British racing outfit Prodrive, a company that had made a name for itself with Subaru in the World Rally Championship in the early \u201890s. Prodrive was already in the process of gauging public interest in a semi-automatic transmission for the street that could be fitted directly to a manual gearbox; buttons on the steering wheel would shift gears while an electronic control unit worked the clutch. Pininfarina saw an opportunity to collaborate, and assigned an engineer whose sole responsibility was working with Prodrive to adapt their system for the FX. Prodrive transmission was mated to the stock Ferrari six-speed manual gearbox already in the Testarossa that Garella had picked out. It wasn\u2019t a perfect fit. While the clutch was hydraulic, engaging different gears was pneumatic. \"Prodrive had a system that was a little bit complex,\" says Garella. \"It had a number of problems and was not really straightforward.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The transmission was going to need continued work, and in fact required constant attention from mechanics to be driveable at all. But it was the best option available at the time. The rest of the FX internals came together without much issue. Pininfarina moved the radiator from the back of the car to the front, to make room for the rear-mounted transmission\u2019s additional electronics, and to capitalize on the increased airflow from the redesigned front end. The engine was tuned, and the exhaust was converted into a snarling straight Tubi system. The catalytic converters on the 4.9-liter V12 were removed, pushing its 420 horsepower northward. Everything else was left stock.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;With the engineering complete, Garella and Pininfarina turned to what they do best: the exterior design.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The result was stunning, if polarizing. Though the deeply inset headlights bring to mind Camaros of the era, and quickly became dated, sculpted dual intakes bring an elegance to the aggressive slope of the front end. Massive, scooping hips presaged the Ferrari 360 Modena \u2014 designed, of course, by Pininfarina \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t come out until 1999. At the rear, the car\u2019s roofline flows down like cooling lava, smoothing out into a point. Quad round taillights from the Ferrari 355 punctuate a dark mesh grille. From the rear three-quarter perspective, the FX radiates aggression, and tremendous potential for speed. The transparent plastic cover over the mid-mounted engine has twelve portholes \u2014 one for each cylinder \u2014 that simultaneously invite and distort the view inside; a Ferrari funhouse. A stylized \"FX\" logo on top of the engine makes it clear this is no run-of-the-mill Ferrari. It is the only such emblem on the car.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pininfarina tested the design in its on-site wind tunnel, and came away pleased. \"The car was definitely better than the Testarossa,\" says Garella. \"And I think it was a quite attractive design for the car at that time.\" Then-chairman Sergio Pininfarina personally showed the completed FX to Gianni Agnelli, the former head of Ferrari parent company Fiat, who simply said: \"We are lucky to have such clients.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pininfarina built the entire outer shell from carbon fiber, which is lighter than aluminum, stronger than steel, and was, at that time, unfathomably expensive. It was also difficult to work with, as very few companies had experience with the material. Pininfarina went through three suppliers before finding the quality necessary. The Pininfarina office in Germany originally constructed the prototypes, but after several mishaps and botched models, the work was brought back to the in-house design center in Cambiano, Italy. At one point, Pininfarina built an entire bonnet for the FX and sent it to Brunei, just to see how it reacted to the sun and humidity of the stifling South Asian climate (an exercise that would prove prophetic). The quality gradually improved. \"We worked a lot to have perfect surfaces,\" says Garella. \"At the end, [it] was the best carbon fibre body Brunei had.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"We are lucky to have such clients.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pininfarina completed the FX in late 1995, with the transmission being its crowning \u2014 but still problematic \u2014 achievement. It was unlike anything done before.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pininfarina built three FXs, and continued experimenting with the Prodrive transmission, adding it to a couple Ferrari F355s \u2013 more than a year before Ferrari made its F355 F1 the first production car with a semi-automatic transmission, in 1997. Pininfarina even put one in another Brunei project, the equally evasive Jaguar XJ220 known internally as \"The J.\" Two were built: one caught fire and was destroyed, the other\u2019s location is simply unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"ferrari-fx-Paul Barshon-optimized-jpg-02\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xuF03XTxlED_-nc_0j6xPAFndRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6295441/pbarshon_160316_0982_0O6A4658.0.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivering a car&lt;/strong&gt; to the royal family of Brunei isn\u2019t as simple as rolling up in a transporter. Pininfarina often loaded the cars into a massive Antanov aircraft, then sent them to Brunei unfinished and had crews complete the work on site. The cars needed to be perfect before the Royal Family saw them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, this led to panic-inducing deadlines. The team once flew a custom Bentley B2 to Brunei the night of a birthday party for Prince Jefri, Hakeem\u2019s father. Condensation from the flight made the car soaking wet, and many of the electronics weren\u2019t working. The car had to be hand-dried, and delivered  to the palace in the nick of time. Hours later, though, Garella got a call that the steering wheel wouldn\u2019t line up perfectly straight. The team pulled the wheel apart and were still working when Prince Hakeem suddenly walked outside to present the car to his father and the entire court. Garella hid behind a pillar \u2014 the Royal Family was not pleased to find their newest vehicle in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Around 3AM, Brunei officials seized their passports, effectively holding them hostage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Another time, converting a Ferrari 288 GTO to right-hand drive had somehow caused the turn signal indicator to stop automatically returning. The team began repairing the problem at 5PM and as time went on, their hosts grew impatient. Around 3AM, Brunei officials seized their passports, effectively holding them hostage. Garella and the team stayed up to finish the work, and reclaimed their passports around 7AM. \"I think still that this was the longest night of my life,\" he says. \"Yes it was stressful but also fantastic. I love it, for an engineer to have the possibility to do a project with an almost unlimited budget is a lifetime dream\u2026 and I was there.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To Garella\u2019s relief, there weren\u2019t any such \"difficulties\" with the FX. In early 1996, Garella and a select few associates made the 6,800-mile trek to Brunei to deliver the three custom Ferraris (during the height of the Royal Family\u2019s car-buying frenzy, he made this trip every other month).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The cars came off the plane ready to be presented, and Prince Hakeem was very pleased with his new toys. Satisfied with the progress of the build months prior, Hakeem had ordered three more FXs; this time, based on the newly-released F512M, a lighter, faster platform that would come with an extra 20 horsepower, a lightweight crankshaft, and titanium connecting rods. Not only that, but the family decided to send the new cars to Oxfordshire, England-based Williams F1, one of the most successful teams in Formula One history, in order to better tune and refine the complicated transmission.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Five of Garella\u2019s FXs were painted the same familiar Ferrari red; the other, FX No. 4, was painted a deep sapphire blue. It\u2019s the only FX that actually made it to Williams, and the only FX that escaped the decaying garages of Brunei.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Once it had possession of the car, Williams used a team from their F1 arm to build the new and improved transmission system in FX No. 4. They replaced the Prodrive components, taking special care to remove all Prodrive branding. Williams plugged in the semi-automatic unit they had been using in Formula One since 1992, and ran immense amounts of wiring through the car. They also replaced the buttons on the steering wheel with paddles. The paddles in the FX appear primitive by today\u2019s standards: they are made of metal, with red on the left for down shifts, and green on the right for up. But it was shaping up to be a marked improvement over the first FX.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The transmission was still being tuned when the Asian markets crashed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"ferrari-fx-Paul Barshon-optimized-jpg-03\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jl8gAcAPYDrKoHiP14DPbS7Otgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6295443/pbarshon_160316_0982_0O6A4593.0.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the summer&lt;/strong&gt; of 1997, the free fall of the Thai baht sparked a domino effect that spread across the Asian markets, and quickly set off a global financial meltdown. Buoyed by its vast oil reserves, Brunei emerged relatively unscathed. The following year, however, a company called Amedeo Development Corporation \u2014 owned and operated by Prince Hakeem\u2019s father, Jefri \u2014 collapsed, leaving behind $6 billion in debt. Prince Jefri\u2019s brother, the Sultan, ordered a review of the country\u2019s financials (&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; once &lt;a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/07/prince-jefri-201107\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that 200 accountants were assigned to the case) and found Jefri had raided some $14 billion of Brunei\u2019s oil funds as his personal piggy bank, using Amedeo to fund extravagant public and personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jefri\u2019s exploits during this fantastic spending spree have since become the stuff of legend. His family of four wives and at least 18 children lived lavishly across London, Paris, Los Angeles, and elsewhere. He commissioned life-sized bronze sculptures of couples having sex, just to offend his more-conservative brother Mohamed. He owned a 152-foot yacht named \"Tits,\" and called the lifeboats \"Nipple 1\" and \"Nipple 2.\" Court documents would reveal that Jefri ultimately spent some $78 million with Pininfarina alone. Some estimates pegged the total number of cars in his priceless collection at more than 2,500 \u2014 others, closer to 5,000.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"Other heads of state and wealthy people have had impressive collections of bespoke cars, but I am pretty sure the Royal Family of Brunei is unparalleled in this regard,\" says Ed Kim, vice president of industry analysis for Auto Pacific. \"Certainly nothing like what they were doing back then is happening now.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Though Jefri was the chief financier of the collection, his brother the Sultan, who once held the title of richest man alive, certainly has his own excessive and frightening habits: he owns (and regularly pilots) a Boeing 747 with a gold and crystal interior, and participated with Jefri in a sex harem that included dozens of women. Some of these women were models and actresses that later claimed they were lured into joining, and sued the brothers. It would be na\u00efve to suggest the Sultan was unaware of his family\u2019s obscene spending. Garella personally witnessed private concerts by the likes of The Gipsy Kings and Sting on palace grounds. Michael Jackson once performed in Brunei for a fee of $17 million, in a stadium built specifically for the event.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Williams made a phone call. American businessman Dick Marconi picked up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Still, the Sultan has held his throne for nearly 50 years, and successfully distanced himself from the global scorn that forced Jefri to flee the country. The Sultan removed Jefri from his positions as Brunei\u2019s minister of finance, and head of the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), that housed the oil funds that Jefri had likely been using to keep Amedeo afloat. In 2000, Prince Jefri turned over his assets. Meanwhile, the prince\u2019s groundbreaking Ferrari sat in a British workshop, suddenly with no owner.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Williams made a phone call. American businessman Dick Marconi picked up. About $1.3 million and 15 years later, I\u2019m staring at my reflection in the indigo carbon fiber weave of Ferrari FX No. 4 in Tustin, California.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"ferrari-fx-Paul Barshon-optimized-jpg-04\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kaIu8ZTSctnKFOzwBvgbcPpVnqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6295447/pbarshon_160316_0982_0O6A4573.0.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\"This is Mr. Marconi\u2019s&lt;/strong&gt; baby,\" says Marconi Museum operations director Todd Ottosen, more than once, as he carefully lowers the entire back section of the FX. Before closing it, he makes a show of effortlessly lifting the carbon fiber engine bay up and down, with two fingers. \"Pretty cool, huh? You can\u2019t even do that with the F40.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Marconi Museum is located inside an unassuming warehouse in a Southern California business park and houses one of the most eclectic, star-studded car collections you could conjure up. Ferraris from every era are scattered about, along with icons like the DeLorean DMC-12 and Lamborghini Countach, and ultra-rare finds like the Cizeta V16T and Aston Martin DB AR1 Zagato. Several retired Indy and Formula One racecars are parked on the floor; others, like the McLaren MP4/4 that Ayrton Senna drove during his 1988 championship season, hang vertically from the walls like 200-mile-per-hour drapes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The museum is the passion project gone wild of Dick Marconi, a co-founder of Herbalife, who has used his fortune to bring automotive brilliance to the public. (Admission is free \u2014 there\u2019s a suggested $5 donation that benefits the museum\u2019s childrens foundation.) This is where Ferrari FX No. 4 has spent the majority of its life, occupying a space between the AR1 and another Pininfarina creation for the Royal Family: a forest-green convertible based on the Ferrari 456 four-seater, called the Venice (like the FX, there are several of these still in Brunei, possibly dozens if you count the custom sedan and wagon versions). Though it may be a relatively pedestrian existence for the FX, one of the most compelling automotive mysteries in a world full of them, the car\u2019s allure is still strong. Rumor has it Marconi has repeatedly turned down offers to sell the car for no less than $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Automotive journalist Winston Goodfellow is one of the few people to have driven the FX outside of Marconi Museum mechanics, when he reviewed the car for an issue of &lt;em&gt;FORZA Magazine&lt;/em&gt; in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In his article, Goodfellow raved that the low weight and advanced technology in the FX made it a thrill to drive: \"While this Ferrari pulls with more alacrity than any TR, what makes the FX truly extraordinary when run hard through the gears is the way the engine works in concert with the transmission: it delivers an excitement that the heavier, production TRs \u2014 or any 355 or 360 \u2014 can\u2019t touch.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"One thing I will say, that does still linger, is it remains one of the coolest things I\u2019ve driven.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years after that drive, the experience of the Williams transmission is still clear in his mind. \"One thing I will say, that does still linger, is it remains one of the coolest things I\u2019ve driven,\" he remembers. Goodfellow\u2019s impressions may provide the clearest perspective to the car\u2019s potential, and that of the Williams semi-automatic system, that we\u2019ll ever have.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"You could feel it going through the motions of what it did, even though it was all paddles. That gave it this perfect blend of coming \u2018digital\u2019 couple with beautiful analog sensations. It had a unique taste that was most appealing, particularly that howling exhaust.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the cars at the Marconi Museum get out more than others. The FX, for example, made a couple of appearances in local car shows during the 2000s, but has otherwise been a homebody. On a routine test drive about two years ago, the FX limped back to the museum spewing white smoke, and hasn\u2019t run since. In total, FX No. 4 has approximately 1,800 miles on the odometer. If they still function \u2014 a big &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; \u2014  it\u2019s likely that the five other FXs have rarely (or more likely, never) been driven at all.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Few have seen it; fewer still have seen what it\u2019s capable of. Vincent Marconi, a 26-year-old mechanic, who also happens to be Dick\u2019s grandson, has seen the FX\u2019s guts spewed out all over the floor. Last year he and Larry Englehart, owner of Ferrari Technology in nearby Orange, began the long journey of making sense of the transmission, and getting the car running again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"It\u2019s still a work in process, and it\u2019s a slow process,\" says Vincent. \"It\u2019s a combination of F1 and space technology, and there are no schematics.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Vincent describes a system truly ahead of its time. The gearbox is the stock six-speed from the F512M, with small modifications to the gears and differential. The attached Prodrive semi-automatic system features fascinating technologies, like an early version of automatic rev-matching to prevent power loss between shifts. Prodrive appears to have never brought its innovative transmission to market, unable to smooth out the wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Even now, it will likely take a Williams technician visiting the car again to get the computer systems ready to run. Vincent Marconi and Englehart plan to get back around to finishing the project one day, but the museum has lots of cars that need attention and the FX isn\u2019t very high on the priority list. Still, the payoff is enticing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"It works bitching once everything is rocking and rolling,\" says Vincent.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div id=\"ferrari-photo-gallery__graphic\" data-analytics-label=\"ferrari-photo-gallery\" data-analytics-viewport=\"graphic\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;!--\r\n(function() {\r\n  var l = function() {\r\n    new pym.Parent(\r\n      'ferrari-photo-gallery__graphic',\r\n      'http://apps.voxmedia.com/graphics/theverge-ferrari-photo-gallery/');\r\n  };\r\n  if(typeof(pym) === 'undefined') {\r\n    var h = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0],\r\n        s = document.createElement('script');\r\n    s.type = 'text/javascript';\r\n    s.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pym/0.4.5/pym.js';\r\n    s.onload = l;\r\n    h.appendChild(s);\r\n  } else {\r\n    l();\r\n  }\r\n})();\r\n// --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garella, now 57,&lt;/strong&gt; resembles his younger self, though the glasses are thinner and the mustache is grayer. He remains a force in innovative design and construction. He spent 17 years at Pininfarina, the final seven as Head of Special Projects. In recent years, he\u2019s been the invisible hand behind two of the most celebrated one-off designs of the past decade. The first is the Pininfarina New Stratos, a modern interpretation of the famous, wedge-shaped Lancia Stratos.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The other is the Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina, commissioned by the filmmaker Jim Glickenhaus. It\u2019s built on a Ferrari Enzo but completely redesigned to pay homage to the legendary 1967 Ferrari 330 P3/4. Garella would also become Project Manager for the company\u2019s associated racing program, designing the P4/5 Competizione, which was built on a Ferrari F430 Scuderia and homologated to race in the Nurburgring 24 Hours. In 2012, it placed 12th overall and won its class. Last year, the team debuted and raced the SCG 003, a new variation that shattered the lap record at The Ring and fielded two entries in the 24-hour race. All of the Glickenhaus racing cars are street-legal, and compete with New York license plates. Another one-off project is underway, but that\u2019s all Garella can say. (In an email, Glickenhaus described Garella as being \"Not fazed by problems and willing to work until they are solved.\")&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Still, the FX holds a special place on his long list of accomplishments. Garella often visits the US to attend events like the Pebble Beach Concours d\u2019Elegance in Monterey, and in 2007, he looked up the Marconi Museum and made the trip down the coast to Tustin. Dick Marconi was waiting for him, and the two posed for pictures with the FX \u2014 a legend created by one and saved by the other. The car wasn\u2019t running then, but its futuristic carbon fiber was still there; as were its eye-popping design, and its embattled but ambitious transmission. Its advancements in design, construction, and technology make the FX a sort of automotive missing link.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"The FX was definitely ahead of its time for having a semi-automatic gearbox,\" says Kim.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"The Sultan and his brother really were R&amp;amp;D for many high-end automakers. They were building custom bespoke cars that not only had unique bodies and interiors, but sometimes exotic technologies. And the money was limitless.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"ferrari-fx-Paul Barshon-optimized-06\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cT8I7EoATUtw5Vwara7pmR1Du2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6294381/pbarshon_160316_0982_0O6A4560.0.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Garella maintains that the true masterpiece of the FX is its body. Not for the design, but for the materials. Today, carbon fiber technology is commonplace in supercars, and even many sports cars. BMW now uses carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) for both the frame and the body of their i3, as well as multiple parts of the new 7 Series luxury sedan. The FX helped set the stage for a new movement in mass production as automakers aim for weight savings to improve performance and fuel economy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"And the money was limitless.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"For me personally, and I think also for Pininfarina, it was the project in which we learned most about carbon fiber and the composite process,\" he says. \"I think for sure that was the project where we brought back the maximum know-how at that point.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Never intended for public consumption, the FX led to the adoption of many new ideas that are common practice in the cars that drive our streets every day. For now, it waits in the museum for an overhaul that may never come, in exile from those that commissioned it; the product of a man who poured years into making it a reality and would use it to influence his trend-setting creations in the future. When he visited the Marconi Museum, the sight of the FX was a welcome one for Garella.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"Prince Hakeem wanted to have all the cars with semi-auto transmission,\" says Garella. \"He thought that this was the future.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"He was right.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;* *&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;chorus-ad data-ad-slot=\"athena_features\"&gt;&lt;/chorus-ad&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;* *&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Design by &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/Happicamp\"&gt;James Bareham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Product by &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/Frank%20Bi\"&gt;Frank Bi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Edited by &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/mvzelenko\"&gt;Michael Zelenko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/chrisziegler\"&gt;Chris Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=\"https://use.typekit.net/ndj3nsh.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;!--\r\ntry{Typekit.load({ async: true });}catch(e){}\r\n// --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n</content>\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11371554/pininfarina-ferrari-fx-first-semi-automatic-transmission\"/>\n    <id>http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11371554/pininfarina-ferrari-fx-first-semi-automatic-transmission</id>\n    <author>\n      <name>Ryan ZumMallen</name>\n    </author>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <published>2016-03-28T11:00:19-04:00</published>\n    <updated>2016-03-28T11:00:19-04:00</updated>\n    <title>Pleasing the Masses</title>\n    <content type=\"html\">  \n  &lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUdN8dUOFhhGRLa3TXhen-LpGAw=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49175657/jbareham_160325_0995_0004_lede_2250px.0.0.jpg\" /&gt;\n\n\n\n  &lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve, 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z hit a small SoHo boutique for a $6,000 shopping spree.

How, exactly, was it possible to spend thousands of dollars on marital aids?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Though the couple\u2019s shopping list was never publicly revealed, one source noted that the purchased items included something gold-plated, which set a number of reporters off on a tear. &lt;em&gt;Refinery29&lt;/em&gt; offered up a list of &lt;a href=\"http://www.refinery29.com/2013/12/59828/beyonce-jay-z-sex-toys\"&gt;possible contenders&lt;/a&gt;, with the Jimmyjane Eternity \u2013 a sleek, diamond-studded, gold vibrator retailing for $3,500 \u2013 leading the list. (The clerk who waited on the Carters told me that the gold-plated item in question was, in fact, the &lt;a href=\"https://www.lelo.com/olga\"&gt;Lelo Olga&lt;/a&gt;, but that the couple had also acquired the Jimmyjane Hello Touch, a finger vibrator popular with couples.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How, exactly, was it possible to spend $6,000 on marital aids?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To those who hadn\u2019t paid attention to pleasure products since Carrie Bradshaw met the Rabbit Habit on &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt;, the story was something of a revelation. Gone were the days of cheaply made, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a4084/chemical-in-vibrators-cause-cancer/\"&gt;occasionally toxic&lt;/a&gt;, vibrators. A new class of items had taken over the market, and they were fashionable, aspirational, and high-end.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;How did we get from the Rabbit Habit to the Little Eternity? Much of the credit goes to &lt;a href=\"http://www.jimmyjane.com/\"&gt;Jimmyjane&lt;/a&gt;, a small, San Francisco-based sex toy company. Over the past decade plus, it has aggressively worked to create a high-end, luxury category within the pleasure product industry.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But now the company that defined the luxury sex toy market is poised to release an entirely new line, LiveSexy. A mid-priced homage to the company\u2019s celebrated premium products, LiveSexy promises to bring \"affordable luxury\" to the market, finally making the aspirational Jimmyjane a much more accessible brand.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Can the brand that brought sex toys from sleazy to chic lead the charge to finally make them completely mainstream?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;\n  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"JJ Intro 2 cropped\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4dO9mwx66NVV3f37fGJDKlW0gMQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6251925/jbareham_160325_0995_0045_cropped.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;Jimmyjane's Intro 2&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After over a decade in San Francisco\u2019s Potrero Hills, Jimmyjane moved offices to Larkspur, CA in the summer of 2015. The company\u2019s two-story office sits in a cute little office park nestled between the water of San Francisco Bay and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. Inside, the decor is chic and white, with display cases showing off some of the company\u2019s signature products (as well as the awards they\u2019ve won), and framed posters from past ad campaigns adorning the office walls.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Since October 2014, Jimmyjane has been under the management of Robert Rheaume, a self-described category and brand builder whose resume includes stints at Odwalla, PepsiCo, LifeFactory, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.mysigg.com/\"&gt;Sigg USA&lt;/a&gt;. An outgoing, affable man with tan skin and a broad smile, Rheaume speaks at length when he gets excited \u2014 which he often does when the conversation turns to the future of his company.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vibrators were introduced as a \"treatment\" for the vaguely-defined female trouble known as hysteria&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Rheaume isn\u2019t the only new face at the Jimmyjane office. Apart from Jimmyjane\u2019s vice president of communications, Molly Murphy, who\u2019s been with the company since 2008, everyone I spoke to joined the company within the last year. That includes industrial designer Carolina Formoso, a stylish, dark-haired woman who speaks in lightly accented English. Hired in 2015, she won Rheaume over by including a vibrator she\u2019d designed as a school project in her portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Though Jimmyjane\u2019s mission to make vibrators everyday objects feels radical, in actuality it\u2019s a kind of a return to the past. Vibrators were introduced to the American public as medical devices, a \"treatment\" for the vaguely defined female trouble known as hysteria, whose symptoms only seemed to subside after the inducement of orgasm (then known as a \"paroxysm\"). Initially invented as a way to provide relief to doctors and their overworked wrists, by the 1900s, vibrators had become common household items, a wellness device deemed so innocuous they were even &lt;a href=\"http://megcr.tumblr.com/image/121890082\"&gt;advertised in the Sears catalog&lt;/a&gt;. But sometime in the early 20th century, vibrators began to appear in stag films, and suddenly the jig was up. Soon the products became the domain of sleazy, sex-crazed perverts; a reputation they retained until at least the 1970s. That\u2019s when pioneers like Dell Williams and Joani Blank opened female-friendly sex toy shops that began to reposition the vibrator as an essential tool for female pleasure. But the available products still lagged behind their boosters\u2019 ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t until the turn of the century that a higher quality product emerged on the market: toxic jelly rubber was abandoned for body-safe silicone, dry cell batteries were replaced with rechargeable lithium ion ones, and some manufacturers even began to offer warranties. In the most stunning turn of all, a few companies began to position their erotic products as luxury devices: an aspirational fashion accessory sported by enviable icons like Kate Moss and Beyonc\u00e9. Suddenly, vibrators weren\u2019t just the sexually liberated woman\u2019s dirty little secret; they were a sign of sophistication and chic.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Suddenly, vibrators were a sign of sophistication and chic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And Jimmyjane is largely responsible for that shift. The company was founded in 2003, when industrial designer Ethan Imboden saw an opportunity to inject innovation and high-end design into an industry better known for cheap products made from shabby materials. Imboden, a stylish, attractive man who combines high-design chic with Bay Area startup savvy and energy, wanted to create the kind of sex toy line a designer could be proud to have in their own bedroom: one with beautiful branding, body-safe materials, and thoughtful, ergonomic engineering and design. His first product was The Little Something, a slim, metal rod with a single speed and a replaceable motor that ran near silently \u2013 an especially impressive bit of engineering when you consider the close relationship between vibration and sound.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Initially eschewing sex shops, Imboden\u2019s team targeted mainstream retailers, positioning their products as accessories to a luxury lifestyle rather than a cheap, seedy thrill. By 2005, the company had developed relationships with mainstream retailers like Fred Segal, C.O. Bigelow, and Harvey Nichols; a year later, Jimmyjane products were being stocked at the Wynn in Las Vegas. As the aughts drew to a close, it started to seem as though the brand was everywhere: in Parisian Sephora; in Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond; in Brookstone; even in the minibar of W Hotels.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet \"&gt;\n  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"JJ Rheaume\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R7ca_Qq74nmtVLsqinmVp5NcjAI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6250977/vpavic_160314_0995_0067.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;Jimmyjane president Robert Rheaume&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yves B\u00e9har lent his talents, designing three different vibrators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And it wasn\u2019t just retailers who were under the Jimmyjane spell. The company won numerous design awards, receiving recognition not just from the adult industry but also mainstream publications including &lt;em&gt;I.D. Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Tank Girl&lt;/em&gt; creator Jamie Hewlett and Dave Stewart from the Eurythmics came on board to collaborate on limited edition lines. Yves B\u00e9har, the founder of Fuseproject and chief creative officer of Jawbone, lent his talents to the company, designing a series of three different vibrators \u2013 Forms 2, 3, and 4 \u2013 that challenged the idea of what a vibrator could, or should, be.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Investors took notice. In 2007, the company was featured in a &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/27/business/27venture.html?_r=0\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; that noted Jimmyjane had six venture capitalists among its investors and was gearing up to raise a second round in the neighborhood of $3 million to $5 million. The company claimed the round would also include marquee funds. To many, it seemed clear that Jimmyjane was on track to change the consumer experience of sex toys, but also the entire nature of how adult products were created, funded, and enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But despite their numerous successes, Jimmyjane still managed to fall short of their lofty goals. Early partnerships with mainstream retailers didn\u2019t live up to their potential: Jimmyjane may have gotten their products in the door, but in many cases, customers just wound up confused both by their presence and their price. Pricey vibrators were already an unusual item; pricey vibrators at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond left customers baffled.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While investment helped kick the company into hyperdrive, it also created expectations that were hard to live up to. As accomplished as the company was, it was still fighting an uphill battle against anti-sex stigma, while also tackling the expensive proposition of developing high quality, beautifully designed hardware.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The cost of designing their first multispeed vibrator nearly tanked the company&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Vibrators can be expensive to bring to market: in &lt;a href=\"https://designmind.frogdesign.com/2015/05/how-to-prevent-design-from-killing-your-company/\"&gt;a 2015 piece&lt;/a&gt;, Imboden explained how designing the Form 6, Jimmyjane's first multispeed vibrator, nearly tanked the company. The product \u2014 which featured cordless charging and was fully submersible \u2014 was incredibly complex. Imboden wrote that the product ended up \"eight months behind, 400% over budget, and\u2026 selling at almost zero margins,\" a phrase few VCs are eager to hear.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In February 2014, it was announced that Diamond Products \u2014 a holding company with a focus on the sex toy industry \u2014 had acquired Jimmyjane. Jimmyjane now found itself partnered with Pipedream Products, another Diamond Products subsidiary that, in many ways, represented everything Jimmyjane had been founded to upend. Pipedream\u2019s extensive offerings include the sort of cheap, crass products more readily associated with darkly-lit porn stores than high-end sex boutiques: &lt;a href=\"http://www.pipedreamproducts.com/show_section?Section=10\"&gt;blow-up dolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.pipedreamproducts.com/show_brand?Brand=King%20Cock\"&gt;huge, hyper-realistic dildos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Though Jimmyjane\u2019s product development, creative, online, sales, and day-to-day operations teams would remain in San Francisco, fans of the brand feared that this was the beginning of the end \u2014 especially when Imboden left the company to &lt;a href=\"http://www.frogdesign.com/archive/press-release/award-winning-designer-entrepreneur-ethan-imboden-joins-frog-head-venture-design.html\"&gt;join design firm frog&lt;/a&gt;. Across the industry, many wondered whether this new Jimmyjane would sustain the innovation, enthusiasm, and creativity that had defined the company in its first decade.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"JJ Intro 1\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CVRSLI0qnRbuQA8FXmiwb7OFPlw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6250967/jbareham_160325_0995_0060.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;Jimmyjane's Intro 1&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;How is Rheaume different than his predecessor? \"I can tell time. Ethan can build a clock and tell time,\" Rheaume says modestly. &amp;nbsp;We\u2019re sitting at the conference table in his office \u2014 the only private room in Jimmyjane\u2019s largely open work space. The full LiveSexy line, arranged by color, sits laid out across the table in front of us. A print of lips on the wall behind Rheaume\u2019s table coordinates nicely with the the pink and dark purple hues of the LiveSexy line.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Rheaume sees himself as simply the custodian of Imboden\u2019s vision, but his tenure has already resulted in a dramatically different business strategy. In the two years since acquisition, Jimmyjane\u2019s methods have changed: where product roll outs used to be a rare, heavily hyped affair, new products are now added to the Jimmyjane catalogue at a rapid clip. It took three years to debut Forms 2, 3, and 4; in contrast, Forms 1, 5, and 8 appeared in quick succession over the course of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Roll outs used to be heavily hyped affairs; now new products are added at a rapid clip&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"The product cycle has been much faster,\" Murphy says. \"We needed to introduce more products,\" she continues, noting that \"it\u2019s something you need for your retailers, and just to keep the company relevant, keep it growing.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Enter the LiveSexy line, a marked departure from the original vision of Jimmyjane as an aspirational, exclusive brand. The LiveSexy line is pitched as \"affordable luxury,\" a way that more budget-minded customers can still get in on the Jimmyjane experience. Where the original Jimmyjane products all retailed for well above $100, the LiveSexy products are available for as low as $29 \u2013 and no more than $59.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This isn\u2019t the first time that the company has made a play for budget-minded consumers. Jimmyjane introduced The Usual Suspects line in 2008, which selected popular vibrators like the Rabbit vibe, Pocket Rocket, and Slimline, remade them in white, and provided them with classy Jimmyjane-branded packaging.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Usual Suspects weren\u2019t original, but the Jimmyjane touch had a magic effect: \"Our customers love them because they had a warranty and they had beautiful, giftable packaging,\" Coyote Amrich, purchasing manager for San Francisco-based sex toy shop Good Vibrations, told me. For some consumers, the packaging and branding were enough to elevate otherwise unexceptional products.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But with the LiveSexy line, Jimmyjane is doing something different, crafting a mid-market homage to the company\u2019s existing Jimmyjane products. The Intro 2 mimics the shape of the two-pronged Form 2; the Intro 6 shares the Form 6\u2019s body hugging curves.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The LiveSexy products aren\u2019t merely the Form toys with cheaper parts: they\u2019ve been thoughtfully redesigned for a mid-tier budget and a beginner mindset. As I surveyed the toys by her desk, Formoso walked me through the work that went into creating a line that\u2019s both stylish and accessible. The LiveSexy line uses less expensive dry cell batteries instead of rechargeable lithium ones. Because the casing for the former is so much larger, it necessarily requires a larger toy; but Formoso feared that merely scaling up the size would render the products clunky and cheap feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"When you\u2019re designing something, you don\u2019t want it to look like you just scaled it up or stretched it in Illustrator,\" Formoso says. \"You have to really go back and redesign how the components are going to fit in.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The goal is to lock in loyal customers long before they\u2019re able to afford one of Jimmyjane\u2019s pricier products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Intro 1, a thin, rectangular panty vibe that looks more like a remote control than a vibrator, may have been her biggest challenge. If the product had merely been scaled up, it would have been huge \u2014 perhaps twice the size of the original \u2014 a potential deal-breaker for a vibrator intended to be discreetly tucked inside a user\u2019s underwear. Formoso\u2019s solution was a product that\u2019s longer than the original, but comparable in width and thickness. For a product that retails at $130 less than the luxury version, that\u2019s a tremendous achievement.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The toys aren\u2019t merely bigger and cheaper, they\u2019re also simpler to use. Unlike the Forms, the Intro toys offer a single button, with three speeds and three modes. (The Forms have 3 buttons.) It\u2019s a simpler, more user-friendly interface \u2014 one that\u2019s less intimidating for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"I took my own experience from the first time I ever thought about buying a vibrator,\" Formoso says. \"When my friend showed me a vibrator for the first time\u2026 it was beautiful, and it had all these functions. All these modes, all these speeds. And it was great, but it was a little too overwhelming for me, because I hadn\u2019t used a vibrator before.\" Formoso hopes that the LiveSexy\u2019s simplified offerings will ease new users into the world of pleasure products, encouraging them to explore and educate themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, says Rheaume, the goal is to lock in loyal customers long before they\u2019re able to afford one of Jimmyjane\u2019s pricier products. In the same way that Cadillac might sell a young buyer an ATS in the hopes that they\u2019ll eventually upgrade to a CT6, Jimmyjane sees the LiveSexy line as a way to familiarize younger, or budget-minded, buyers with the designs of high-end offerings. If you\u2019ve fallen for the Intro 2\u2019s two-pronged body and dual motors, you\u2019ll be eager to switch to the more compact Form 2, which offers a rechargeable battery, more modes, and a more nuanced interface.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"JJ Double\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DyiJtMJADL1qht2Rf8c4EfKwLWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6251001/jbareham_160325_0995_0008_double_up.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;Above: Jimmyjane's Intro 6; below, the Form 6&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Set back from the bustling Santa Monica Boulevard, the West Hollywood Pleasure Chest is partially obscured by lush greenery. Though its neon signs don\u2019t scream upscale boutique, inside the store \u2014 the West Coast sibling of the shop where Carrie Bradshaw discovered the Rabbit vibe \u2014 a friendly, educated staff helps customers pick from a wide selection of toys, lingerie, and other adult products.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Products at The Pleasure Chest are organized both by price and type, and Jimmyjane products can be found throughout. The Form line occupies a coveted display along the back wall, where the store showcases its premium products. Nearby sat a tower showcasing toys from competitor Lelo and other similarly-priced offerings from companies like Fun Factory also receive dedicated shelf space.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Pleasure Chest offers an almost overwhelming selection of toys, highlighting another of Jimmyjane\u2019s challenges. In 2003 Imboden entered a space suffering from a dearth of decent products; Rheaume\u2019s company faces a field crowded with competitors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In 2003 there was a dearth of decent products; today there's a field crowded with competitors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"Twelve years ago, it was like, \u2018Thank god, there\u2019s a new product we can add,\u2019\" Good Vibrations\u2019 Amrich told me. \"And now we pick and choose by necessity.\" Thanks in part to Jimmyjane\u2019s work, starting a sex toy company carries a lot less stigma than it used to. And that means an incredibly crowded market. According to Amrich, sex toy trade shows are now full of brand new companies, offering full lines with thousands of products.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike some of its peers \u2014 Babeland in New York, or Good Vibrations in San Francisco \u2014 The Pleasure Chest displays many of its wares in their packaging, which could make a difference for the LiveSexy line. Out of the box, the Intro 2 might not seem radically different from something like the similarly priced &lt;a href=\"http://www.calexotics.com/p-21257-body-soul-connection-massagers.aspx\"&gt;California Exotics Body &amp;amp; Soul Connection&lt;/a&gt;; but compare the packaging side by side, and the Intro 2 clearly broadcasts a higher level of class.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If popularity of The Usual Suspects line is any indication, that branding could make all the difference. Though vibrators are ostensibly just about sensation \u2014 the prettiest toy is ultimately a failure if it doesn\u2019t lead to an orgasm \u2014 they\u2019re also signifiers of who we are and how we want to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The LiveSexy line also gives newcomers a way to explore many different types of stimulation for less than the price of a Form 6 \u2014 an appealing prospect given that, once used, a vibrator can\u2019t be exchanged or returned. Taking a risk on a pricey vibrator only to discover its shape doesn\u2019t work for your body is an unappealing proposition.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is convinced that the LiveSexy line holds promise. \"I wish they had come out with different shapes,\" Amrich told me. \"As a concept, I really love [high-end] brands coming out with affordable lines,\" she continued, pointing to products like Fun Factory\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.funfactory.com/en/vibrators/jam/\"&gt;Jam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.funfactory.com/en/vibrators/joupie/\"&gt;Joupie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.funfactory.com/en/vibrators/jazzie/\"&gt;Jazzie&lt;/a&gt; as \"entry level\" vibrators that familiarize new, or more budget-minded, buyers with a brand\u2019s offerings.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"JJ Murphy\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XrbXQAFaiCLhgQLEmSRvLln2NOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6250991/vpavic_160314_0995_0061.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;Jimmyjane\u2019s director of product development, Miranda Doyle&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For Amrich, the replication of the Form line\u2019s shapes, but at a lower price point, runs the risk of cannibalizing the Form line\u2019s existing market. In a small boutique, where shelf space is at a premium, it can be difficult to justify stocking two aggressively similar product lines \u2014 particularly when there are so many other competing products at both price points.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first run of the LiveSexy line has already sold out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless Rheaume remains convinced that the LiveSexy line was the right move. \"We absolutely explored if not dozens, hundreds of different shapes and designs,\" Rheaume told me. \"But we always fell back on our classic designs.\" In a market where other brands were already knocking off Jimmyjane designs, offering inferior products and subpar experiences at lower cost, it made sense to reclaim the designs and create a budget-minded line in-house. \"Why not take our classic Jimmyjane shapes [that] have already become ubiquitous in the marketplace and own them back again?\" Rheaume asked.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;According the Rheaume, the move is paying off: he told me that after making the rounds at trade shows, the first run of the LiveSexy line has already sold out.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As the company expands, boutiques like Good Vibrations may be less essential to Jimmyjane\u2019s bottom line. Though the company remains loyal to the stores that have made it successful, Rheaume routinely mentions retailers like Target and Walgreens (both of whom have begun stocking vibrators in recent years and have already approached JimmyJane) and even healthy grocery chains like Whole Foods, Wegmans, or Sprouts as possible retail spaces.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s in this context that the LiveSexy line may make the most sense. While the Form line\u2019s products might be too expensive for the average big box customer, the Intro toys could be very attractive to this audience \u2013 especially if they\u2019re competing with low-end products from companies like Trojan and Durex, whose wares currently dominate the aisles of mainstream retailers. Compared to those toys, the LiveSexy line is a paragon of high design.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At their lower prices, the LiveSexy line makes the products feel more like a sexy splurge than a serious investment. Back in the early days of Jimmyjane, when the Form 6 was stocked by retailers like Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond, sales associates \u2014 for whom the product was something of an anomaly \u2014 weren\u2019t up to the challenge of educating the consumer about the value of a $175 pleasure product. Now they won\u2019t have to.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left size-adjust\"&gt;   &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"JJ Vertical\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lRBMa-hlVadvmYakFV2sVZWRQDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6252017/jbareham_160325_0995_0041_vertical_crop_01.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;Jimmyjane's Intro 4&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We want to make sure that the [retailers] we align with are people that believe in the category and more importantly believe in our brand,\" Rheaume says. \"I believe if we do it right, with the right partner\u2026 it will bring incremental users into the space. And typically when you bring incremental users into a category or space, they will seek out those specialty stores for the broader, deeper, richer experience and possibilities that are available to them.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Rheaume, a comic book fan, likens it to manga and comic books being stocked by Barnes &amp;amp; Noble. Many feared the bookselling giant would lead to the end of specialty comic book stores like Forbidden Planet, but that wasn\u2019t what happened. Instead, box stores attracted a whole new audience \u2014 an audience that then went on to support smaller stores that offered a broader selection and more knowledgeable staff.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"What made me so excited about coming over to this assignment was Ethan and the team back in 2004, 2005 \u2013 they transcended the category. The category today would not look anything like it does today if Jimmyjane did not give birth to it,\" Rheaume tells me back in his office. \"I think there\u2019s another opportunity here for Jimmyjane to democratize the sex toy experience by bringing the premium experience to the everyday user.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;No one knows yet if Jimmyjane\u2019s new strategy will be successful. Selling affordable, well-made vibrators to Whole Foods patrons may not have been Ethan Imboden\u2019s original vision. But it could easily have a far greater impact on the sex toy landscape than everything else the company has accomplished thus far.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If the company is successful, they\u2019ll have helped the vibrator restore its reputation, returning it to its status as a common household object. Only this time, the women buying their vibrators from the modern-day equivalent of the Sears catalog won\u2019t need to be coy about what, exactly, they\u2019re purchasing. And that, ultimately, is the most important cultural shift of all.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Portrait photography by &lt;a href=\"http://recode.net/author/vjeran-pavic/\"&gt;Vjeran Pavic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Design and product photography by &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/Happicamp\"&gt;James Bareham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Edited by &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/lopatto\"&gt;Elizabeth Lopatto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/mvzelenko\"&gt;Michael Zelenko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;!--\r\nvar width = $(window).width();\r\n$(window).resize(function(){\r\n   if($(this).width() != width){\r\n      width = $(this).width();\r\n      if(width &lt; 600) {\r\n        $(\"span.dropcap\").removeAttr(\"class\");\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n});\r\n// --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n</content>\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/28/11313512/new-jimmyjane-livesexy-intro-2-6-vibrators-ceo-interview\"/>\n    <id>http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/28/11313512/new-jimmyjane-livesexy-intro-2-6-vibrators-ceo-interview</id>\n    <author>\n      <name>Lux Alptraum</name>\n    </author>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <published>2016-03-28T10:00:19-04:00</published>\n    <updated>2016-03-28T10:00:19-04:00</updated>\n    <title>Oculus Rift review</title>\n    <content type=\"html\">  \n  &lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BTOrwcZp7n8xc0KwyN2BAkido0A=/0x225:1667x1336/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49175059/jbareham_160322_0986_0131_fin_vertical.0.0.png\" /&gt;\n\n\n\n  &lt;p&gt;For a long time, the hopes and dreams of many virtual reality fans could be summed up with two words: Oculus Rift. Helped by the rise of cheap smartphone displays, Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey took a technology that most people considered a retro curiosity and convinced them that it could change the world. The Rift let you skydive without a parachute. It helped artists show the world through another person\u2019s eyes. It simulated beheading.

Consumer virtual reality went from a gaming peripheral to an all-purpose entertainment device, and then to the next great evolution in computing. While \"Oculus Rift\" was no longer a synonym for \"virtual reality,\" Oculus remained a central player, especially after Facebook purchased it for an estimated $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There was just one problem: nobody knew what the Rift would look like, or when it would come out. Luckey and the rest of Oculus\u2019 leadership were adamant about not making promises they couldn\u2019t keep, or delivering an undercooked product \u2014 two things that doomed consumer virtual reality decades ago. But after nearly four years, the finished Oculus Rift has shipped to its very first group of customers, and it\u2019s time to see whether the headset that started it all is still pushing the cutting edge of virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Oculus Hardware\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yeHuvcViM1FcZdrhmicug9u4_nI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6250789/jbareham_160322_0986_0225_fin.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"dropcap\"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;culus rarely brags about its industrial design, but one of the best things it\u2019s done is make something so stereotypically geeky look (relatively) natural. The $599 consumer Rift is full of clever and thoughtful touches, starting with the delightfully soft rubberized carrying case it ships in, which makes the whole thing feel like a cyberpunk hacker\u2019s console. The all-black headset is downright understated by gaming hardware standards, with a front of smooth rubber, sides coated in coarse cloth, and lenses surrounded by a web of lycra. It\u2019s tethered to a PC by a single wire, which runs out your left temple and along one of the adjustable side straps. William Gibson\u2019s best-known foray into virtual reality might be &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;, but the Rift feels more like something from his design-obsessed novel &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt; \u2014 it\u2019s the kind of minimalist product that its brand-allergic, coolhunting protagonist Cayce Pollard might approve of.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The screen\u2019s clarity depends on precisely how it\u2019s angled toward your eyes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Getting the Rift to fit right can prove elusive at first. While there\u2019s a small focus knob at the bottom, a lot of the screen\u2019s clarity depends on precisely how it\u2019s angled toward your eyes, and it\u2019s easy to give yourself a headache by strapping it as tightly as possible to keep the best fit. But once you get used to wearing it, the headset feels lighter and more comfortable than most of its competition, sealing against your face with a firm but pliable ring of foam. Since I have yet to break a sweat in the Rift, I can\u2019t say how easy it is to clean, but the ring is removable and replaceable \u2014 although there\u2019s no spare included. I also don\u2019t have to deal with wearing glasses, but my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues who do have had a positive response \u2014 they could either fit the headset over moderately-sized frames or, depending on their prescription, get the screen in focus without them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Along with a cylindrical black tracking camera on a slender 8-inch stand, the Rift comes with &amp;nbsp;two accessories: an Xbox One gamepad and a small, simple device called the Oculus Remote. Unlike Sony and HTC, Oculus isn\u2019t launching the Rift with a full controller of its own, since its Oculus Touch hardware will arrive in the second half of this year. For now, the chunky and colorful Xbox gamepad seems slightly out of place alongside the sleek Rift design. The oval-shaped black remote, by contrast, fits right in, although its construction doesn\u2019t feel as solid as the rest of the system.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Rift is something I\u2019d be happy to have in my living room, and compared to the developer-focused Oculus devices of years past, it\u2019s a breeze to set up. The 4-meter headset tether ends with one USB and one HDMI port, and the tracking camera is plugged in with its own USB cable \u2014 there\u2019s no external power cable or controller box for either piece. You\u2019ll just download Oculus\u2019 Windows app and run through a short, though descriptive, setup checklist before getting into VR. Granted, getting to this point requires having a powerful gaming desktop, which can produce plenty of glitches on its own. And since most PCs have only one HDMI port, you\u2019ll need to use a different connection for your monitor, an extra and not totally intuitive step for many people. For the most part, though, it\u2019s as easy as I can imagine installing a totally new kind of computer hardware to be.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;\n  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Oculus Gaming\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/swzSCuhvWHCvB8LFZc0wGYdwIGk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6250833/jbareham_160322_0986_0084_fin.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;Screenshots from top to bottom: EVE Valkyrie, Chronos, Darknet&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"dropcap\"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;one of this matters if the view from inside the Rift is no good \u2014 and fortunately, it holds up. The headset contains a pair of lenses, a gyroscope and accelerometer, a pair of decent-quality removable earphones, and two 1200 x 1080 screens. The image they produce is bright and relatively clear (although it still has a bit of the graininess that almost all VR headsets struggle with), and the overall resolution is about the same as the single-screened Gear VR. Any bright lights in the center of the virtual world sometimes reflect what looks like a lens flare around the edges of your vision, but it\u2019s minimally distracting. The Rift\u2019s field of view doesn\u2019t seem better than previous versions, but it\u2019s wide enough to give you a decent amount of peripheral vision. There\u2019s almost no visible latency; as long as you stay within sight of the camera, it mirrors your head movement precisely, even when you turn completely around.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Rift\u2019s single-tracking camera doesn\u2019t give you as much space to move around in as the \"room-scale\" HTC Vive or a two-camera Oculus Touch setup, but it supports a few steps in any direction; I measured a functional square of space around six and a half feet wide and four and a half deep. The biggest problem is that it\u2019s impossible to tell where that space ends until you step outside it, causing a sickening jerk as the world stops responding to your motion. Right now, it\u2019s not particularly noticeable, because almost none of the Rift launch titles ask you to move. A few make sense standing up, like the diorama-like tower defense game &lt;em&gt;Defense Grid 2&lt;/em&gt;, but the vast majority seem intended to play in a stationary chair, looking straight forward with occasional turns of the head.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Oculus Hardware 2\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDagl4DYu9EH3M6IpuE4b2LE6aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6250805/jbareham_160322_0986_0214_fin.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The result is a lot of games where VR feels like an addition, not a transformation. Most of the first-person experiences could translate to flat screens without much trouble, and some \u2014 like space exploration game &lt;em&gt;Adrift&lt;/em&gt; \u2014 are already coming to both VR and flatscreen platforms like PC and PlayStation 4. The plethora of third-person action games like &lt;em&gt;Lucky\u2019s Tale&lt;/em&gt; might need to be redesigned slightly for players who can\u2019t lean over the environments, but they\u2019re still close adaptations of established formats. The titles that feel most clearly designed for virtual reality were early experiments that came to Gear VR before the consumer Rift. That includes &lt;em&gt;Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes&lt;/em&gt;, which takes advantage of a headset\u2019s isolating effects, and &lt;em&gt;Darknet&lt;/em&gt;, whose sprawling puzzle maps would look painfully cramped on a smaller screen.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The result is a lot of games where VR feels like an addition, not a transformation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In some cases, VR still fills genuine gaps in a familiar experience. CCP\u2019s &lt;em&gt;EVE: Valkyrie&lt;/em&gt; could certainly have been developed as a standard space-fighting game, a genre whose controls usually confound me. But somehow, being able to see the cockpit all around me makes it easier to understand how my ship should move, and using the Rift\u2019s head tracking to fire missiles feels much better than pointing a joystick. Racing or flying simulations aren\u2019t things that could only be done in VR, but it\u2019s arguably the best place for them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Conversely, VR-friendly design occasionally hampers a game. &lt;em&gt;Chronos&lt;/em&gt;, a beautiful fantasy game that\u2019s become one of my favorite Rift launch titles, uses the same combat mechanics as &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, the camera moves between fixed angles for each area instead of directly following the player. This gives you a perfect view of its beautiful environments, and it cuts the risk of motion sickness to almost zero. But it also means that large enemies can block your view of the protagonist, and the camera will disorientingly pop to a completely different location if you move too far during a battle.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Oculus controller\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nMDOHr7JjS1BvTeHwB9cnAA2VfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6250841/jbareham_160322_0986_0255_fin.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal for VR gaming, though, is to get to a point where we\u2019re talking about experiences instead of the technology that enables them. And the Rift\u2019s launch is the first time I\u2019ve played anything that could rival a decently made non-VR computer game for polish and scope. Having high-quality hardware to play with has helped make this possible \u2014 nothing is fun if you can\u2019t see the images clearly and get sick after half an hour, two common problems with the very first Rift development kits. So has the fact that developers now stand some chance of making money off their work. Whatever the exact confluence of factors, &lt;em&gt;Chronos&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;EVE: Valkyrie&lt;/em&gt; are more than just good picks if you happen to have a VR headset. If you like flying or fighting in video games, they\u2019ll make you want a VR headset so you can play them \u2014 maybe not badly enough to spend $600, but it\u2019s a start.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, it may take some time to make the Rift\u2019s virtual world more coherent and interesting. The main headset menu exists in a stark modernist room with a rumpled and totally incongruous carpet in the middle, a weird bit of skeuomorphism that\u2019s just substantial enough to feel like it ought to be personalizable. Instead, there are only flat icons for a store, a library, and a list of friends that can join you in &lt;em&gt;EVE: Valkyrie&lt;/em&gt; or other multiplayer titles. If you\u2019re not interested in playing games, you can experience a few interactive short films on the Rift, like Oculus\u2019 &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; or Penrose\u2019s &lt;em&gt;The Rose and I.&lt;/em&gt; Virtual reality studio Jaunt has an app, and Oculus has its own photo and video tools, which play both VR and non-VR files from your PC or sources like Twitch and Facebook. But the Rift doesn\u2019t seem to have imported the Gear VR\u2019s various non-gaming social experiences, its VR versions of Netflix and Hulu, or its large collection of 360-degree video apps. A feature that would have allowed Xbox One owners to stream non-VR console games to the headset, promised last year, also won\u2019t be live at launch.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"white-background\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Oculus Adi portrait\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IlLOOuIHkX9K9WUy3550Jd6horQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6250847/jbareham_160322_0986_0131_fin_vertical.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"dropcap\"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hatever else you can do, there\u2019s no doubt that games like &lt;em&gt;EVE: Valkyrie&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chronos&lt;/em&gt; provide the headset\u2019s most immersive moments. When we talk about \"immersion\" in VR, we\u2019re often talking about two separate effects. The first is a sense of realism, of connecting your physical body perfectly to your virtual presence. The second is the sort of immersion that a really engrossing role-playing game like &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; can induce: the knowledge that you could lose a whole weekend to it without even noticing. Think of it as \"I\u2019m really there\" versus \"I\u2019m never leaving.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Rift feels as close to being a brain in a jar as humanly possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Oculus Rift can produce less of this first type than the HTC Vive right now, and it probably will until the Touch controllers ship. But that might actually mean that it offers more of the second. Where our Vive development kit\u2019s weight and motion controls tire me out enough to want periodic breaks, I can easily spend two or three hours at a time in the Rift; I could probably go almost indefinitely if I didn\u2019t have to check email and jot down review notes. VR game developers have yet to produce the kind of 40-plus-hour time sinks that are standard in PC and console gaming, but it\u2019s been almost as hard to tear myself away from &lt;em&gt;Chronos&lt;/em&gt; as it was to turn off the PlayStation during my &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt; addiction.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This allays one of my biggest fears about virtual reality: that headsets will remain a platform for 20-minute novelty experiences instead of ambitious longform games and fiction. On a purely physical level, however, I\u2019m more ambivalent. Motion-controlled virtual reality experiences \u2014 games and apps that ask me to mime things like shooting or painting with my hands \u2014 have gotten me physically engaged with computing in a way I\u2019ve never been, and they leave me feeling better as a result. I love the feeling of getting real exercise in a virtual sword-fighting game, or of walking around a real room to see the artwork I\u2019ve created. Sitting down with the Rift, meanwhile, feels as close to being a brain in a jar as humanly possible.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Oculus face-on\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QEj9Zdp6EHVG_LuMkj-0lRfoXlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6250853/jbareham_160322_0986_0235_fin.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;James Bareham&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Playing non-VR video games is already a sedentary activity, and I find myself moving even less in the Rift, since I can\u2019t get distracted by my phone or lean over to grab a drink of water. As Oculus writes on a warning screen that appears every time you boot up the Rift: \"In using this headset, you will lose the ability to see and hear what\u2019s actually around you.\" In third-person experiences, you can\u2019t even see that you have a body. I come out of stand-up VR games energized, even when my arms ache and I\u2019m sweating. I leave long-seated Rift sessions with the same fatigue I get from spending a night hunched over my gaming PC, with the occasional side of nausea and eye strain.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m in no position to advise anyone on the potential medical risks of VR, but I haven\u2019t had any serious issues with the Rift so far. &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/18/7235895/seeing-i-artist-to-spend-a-month-in-virtual-reality\"&gt;Very long virtual reality excursions&lt;/a&gt; (think days, not hours) have anecdotally weakened people\u2019s eyesight for short periods, and my own eyes would hurt a little after a couple of hours, like a more extreme version of staring at a computer screen late into the night. My other problems have been similarly mundane. VR\u2019s constant head tilts exacerbate a neck and shoulder pain that I developed a few months ago, and games that involve a lot of fast \"walking\" with a controller still make me sick. At one point I got out of a morning session dizzy and lightheaded; I wondered if I had finally experienced some kind of reaction to leaving reality until I realized that I was just hungry after pushing my meals back for more Rift time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"Just a few more months\" has been the mantra of virtual reality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Talking about any physical downsides to VR plays into all sorts of unpleasant dystopian tropes. You\u2019ve got shades of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix,&lt;/em&gt; where people\u2019s bodies atrophy while they\u2019re living in a machine-constructed dreamworld; of the zombie-like VR junkies in &lt;em&gt;Shadowrun&lt;/em&gt;; and of every other movie, book, and video game about people ruining their real-world lives to enjoy a virtual one. And there is something a little eerie about putting on a headset in a room with other people, then coming out hours later with red grooves worn into your cheeks and realizing that you\u2019re all alone. But it\u2019s not fundamentally different from any other intense gaming session, except that VR\u2019s nearly mystical reputation primes us to blame or praise it for every unusual feeling we experience around a headset. If anything, the Vive and Oculus Touch have shown us how much motion-controlled VR could &lt;em&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt; the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"Just a few more months\" has been the mantra of virtual reality since people started getting excited about the Oculus Rift, and saying it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the headset is released feels like either a huge cop-out or a sign that the VR we want may never actually arrive. But it\u2019s impossible to think of all the unreleased Oculus Touch experiences I\u2019ve tried \u2014 like three-dimensional painting tool Quill, Old West shooting gallery &lt;em&gt;Dead &amp;amp; Buried&lt;/em&gt;, and a VR version of &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt; \u2014 and not feel like the Rift\u2019s best days are still ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time, though, there\u2019s something to do while you wait. The high cost of buying and running high-end VR headsets makes them inaccessible to many people, and the Rift in particular is relentlessly focused on gaming. Within these limitations, though, the Rift makes a good case for seated VR, and it lays a solid foundation for what\u2019s to come. The headset you can buy today is not Oculus\u2019 most ambitious vision for virtual reality \u2014&amp;nbsp;but it\u2019s a vision that Oculus has successfully delivered on.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul id=\"scorecard\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"procon\"&gt;Good Stuff&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Great-looking industrial design&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;A few really good seated VR games&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Promising future game catalog with Touch controllers&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"procon\"&gt;Bad Stuff&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Expensive, especially with gaming PC cost figured in&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Not much to do outside gaming&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Lack of motion controls at launch is a big weakness&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"procon\"&gt;Verge Score&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"score-number\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Oculus number 8\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPqNTtF2UMN1swJcDAfD9jVuKXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6252031/vrg_oculus_number.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Design by &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/Happicamp\"&gt;James Bareham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Product by &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/Frank%20Bi\"&gt;Frank Bi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Edited by &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/ohnorosco\"&gt;Ross Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=\"https://use.typekit.net/gth6ibi.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;!--\r\ntry{Typekit.load({ async: true });}catch(e){}\r\n// --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6236119/parallax.0.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;!--\r\n\tvar scene = document.getElementById('scene');\r\n\tvar parallax = new Parallax(scene, {\r\n\t\tinvertX: true,\r\n\t\tinvertY: true,\r\n\t\tlimitX: false,\r\n\t\tlimitY: false,\r\n\t\toriginX: 0.5,\r\n\t\toriginY: 0.5\r\n\t});\r\n// --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n</content>\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/28/11284590/oculus-rift-vr-review\"/>\n    <id>http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/28/11284590/oculus-rift-vr-review</id>\n    <author>\n      <name>Adi Robertson</name>\n    </author>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <published>2016-03-22T09:00:22-04:00</published>\n    <updated>2016-03-22T09:00:22-04:00</updated>\n    <title>Remote, Controlled</title>\n    <content type=\"html\">  \n  &lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vkK0wYjOHfnd2jj72AslxdwETyI=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49139017/jbareham_160321_0983_0067.0.0.png\" /&gt;\n\n\n\n  &lt;p&gt;Matt McRae is fired up about remote controls.

And he thinks remote controls are very, very stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"I can\u2019t believe we have rubber buttons and a plastic housing with double-A batteries,\" he says. \"We\u2019re navigating from remotes that were invented in the 1950s. That needs to be dynamited.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What if all the TVs in your home were just extensions of your phone?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And McRae has dynamite in hand. Vizio\u2019s new P-Series TVs are a radical departure from the rest of the industry. Unlike the smart TVs that dominate the market, the P-Series completely lacks an on-screen interface \u2014 there are no apps or menus or controls or even picture settings on the TV itself. There\u2019s nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, Vizio has partnered with Google to redesign the entire TV experience around the Google Cast streaming protocol, the same technology used in the wildly popular Chromecast streaming stick. The P-Series comes with a six-inch Android tablet, and everything is controlled by the new Vizio SmartCast app. There\u2019s also an iOS version of the app, and any other app or service that supports Cast can send content to the TV.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It's a simple idea with enormous implications: what if all the TVs in your home were just extensions of your phone?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"The era of having a couple of buttons on a physical remote that sits there and does nothing else is going to end,\" says McRae, his voice rising. \"We\u2019re the ones who are going to end it.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Vizio Matt TVs\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctS5e0jsKL2aPlVFcbJ3LuRPcfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6227569/pbarshon_160317_0983_0136.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;Vizio chief technology officer Matt McRae&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People have been trying &lt;/strong&gt;to smash computers and televisions together since the \u201880s, a concept generally called \"smart TV.\" Hang out with people building smart TV interfaces long enough, and you\u2019ll notice an entire language has evolved around it. They talk about \"leaning back versus leaning forward\" and solving \"10-foot interface issues\" and \"replacing input one\" and a host of other terms that all revolve around a single problem no one has ever managed to really solve:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Navigating TV interfaces sucks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"A better remote control is not the answer.\" &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s particularly awful if you have to hunt and peck with cursor keys on a regular remote, but no other solution is that much better. It doesn\u2019t matter if you ship a full-size keyboard with a trackpad, like Sony and Logitech have done in the past. It doesn\u2019t matter if you stick a bunch of QWERTY keys on a regular remote to make typing easier, like TiVo and Vizio have each tried. It doesn\u2019t matter if you build the world\u2019s sleekest touch remote and ask people to use apps on the screen, like the new Apple TV. It doesn\u2019t matter if you go all-in on voice search and let people just ask for what they want, like Roku and Amazon and a host of others are doing. None of these ideas have ever cracked the fundamental problem: TVs are for &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt; things, not &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"A better remote control is not the answer,\" says McRae. \"That\u2019s the wrong way to think about it. We\u2019ve done touchpad remotes. We\u2019ve done keyboards. We\u2019ve prototyped motion sensing. We\u2019ve gone down all those paths and we think they\u2019re all cul-de-sacs. The answer is to get rid of the remote control as a device category. Any screen should be a remote control.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;\n\r\n&lt;div data-volume-player-choice=\"youtube\" data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:feature:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"New Vizio P-Series TV hands-on | 7214\" data-volume-uuid=\"5086b204b\" data-volume-id=\"7214\" data-analytics-placement=\"feature:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" id=\"volume-placement-9446\" class=\"volume-video\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Vizio is a quiet company \u2014&amp;nbsp;most people don\u2019t even realize that it\u2019s based in America, headquartered in Irvine, California. It\u2019s also a tiny company, with just about 450 employees. Yet by designing products in the States and leveraging tight relationships with manufacturing partners like AmTran and Hon Hai to undercut competitors\u2019 pricing, Vizio has come to dominate the US TV market in recent years. Vizio TVs routinely sit atop the charts at review sites like &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Wirecutter&lt;/em&gt;, and the company currently leads in both smart TV and overall TV unit shares over rivals like Samsung and Sony. The company doesn\u2019t spend a ton on marketing, instead focusing on what it calls the \"reco rate,\" or how likely Vizio owners are to recommend the products to their family and friends. McRae proudly says it\u2019s the highest in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But over time, Vizio\u2019s Yahoo-based VIA Apps smart TV platform had become dated; the company needed a new platform. The company could have picked any number of other smart TV solutions \u2014 including Google\u2019s own Android TV \u2014 but McRae wanted to do something more radical: try and reset the entire model of how people interact with the screens in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"The mental and strategic leap is breaking up navigation and consumption,\" he says. \"A handheld device has proven to be an extraordinarily adept navigation device, and it has become an extraordinarily personalized experience. That is not something a television hanging on a wall ten feet away from you will ever be. A TV should be focused on rendering video in the most perfect way possible.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Vizio TV Close-up\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RLJht0sRK8E39bocTCx8C1sx4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6227639/pbarshon_160317_0983_0481.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The company\u2019s solution is the Vizio Tablet Remote, which isn\u2019t a remote at all: it\u2019s a six-inch tablet running stock Android Lollipop on an eight-core Snapdragon processor with a very nice 1080p screen, a soft-touch back, dual speakers, and a wireless charging cradle. It lacks any dedicated buttons to control the TV \u2014 it only turns into a \"remote\" when you open Vizio\u2019s new SmartCast app or kick off a streaming session from another app that supports Cast, like Hulu or Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But you don\u2019t have to cast anything to the TV at all \u2014 after all, it\u2019s just an Android tablet. You can go ahead and watch Netflix on the Smart Remote if you want. You can download apps from the Play Store. You can cast Netflix to the TV and use the tablet to check Twitter. You can let a kid play games on the tablet and control the entire TV with the SmartCast app on your iPhone. The tablet is basically another small TV.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tablet is basically another small TV&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This seemingly simple approach represents a complete reversal of the industry-standard idea that mobile devices are \"second screens\" in the living room \u2014 the phone in your hand showing your Twitter while you watch &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;on TV, for example.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"Vizio understood the power of bringing the interaction model to the second screen,\" says Mario Queiroz, the Google VP in charge of Cast. \"They understood the ability they would have to build a lot of experiences you couldn\u2019t build on the first screen.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With the new P-Series, t&lt;span&gt;he Vizio tablet remote &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the first screen, and the 4K HDR television is the second.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s hard not to contrast Vizio\u2019s kill-the-remote strategy against Apple\u2019s new Apple TV, which is entirely built around the new touch-based Siri Remote. Apple is extending iOS into the traditional first screen TV interface; Vizio wants to erase that interface entirely. \"Companies that are newer to the living room space have yet to go all the way down to the end of the cul-de-sac, but they will,\" says McRae when I ask him about Apple. \"They\u2019ll get there and they\u2019ll realize that they\u2019re stuck, and no matter what you do with a tiny little remote control in your hand, you\u2019re not going to be able to provide the advanced navigation consumers demand from apps and services.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Vizio Team\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iCFRpWXj6O3rRkMFlIz8Q8heCb0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6227573/pbarshon_160317_0983_0198.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;Vizio's McRae, design VP Scott McManigal and software and services head Bill Baxter look at a prototype SmartCast speaker.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work on the P-Series&lt;/strong&gt; started two years ago, after Google first introduced the popular Chromecast streaming stick. Vizio had already built an Android TV streaming box called the Co-Star, and quickly reached out to Google\u2019s Cast team. \"It was kind of a meeting in the lobby, just very quickly, because we\u2019d been working with that team,\" says McRae.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Vizio wanted to use Cast as the platform to power its next generation of televisions, but there was a lot of work to be done: Cast didn\u2019t support actually running a TV. It also didn\u2019t support two major innovations Vizio was keen on introducing: 4K streaming and the new Dolby Vision high dynamic range standard, both of which represent major upgrades over standard TVs. \"It\u2019s not like a physical dongle just slapped in the back,\" says McRae. \"It was actually a very deep integration. You want to be able to cast right on top of HDMI 1 and have it seamlessly switch.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"Their product will get better and better over time.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"The Cast software is interacting directly with the TV firmware,\" says Queiroz. \"Our experience with Chromecast significantly helped with building the Vizio TV experience, and what we\u2019re learning with working with a partner like Vizio will definitely help us with the Chromecast lineup.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Vizio and Google worked closely to extend the capabilities of Cast, eventually building an entirely new framework for Cast that let it hook into the P-Series while allowing Vizio\u2019s code to control things like technical picture settings. Both sides were wary of creating another variant of Cast, confusing or fragmenting one of the largest streaming platforms on the market.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The work eventually led to a unique system design: Google actually controls the Cast software on the P-Series, which is kept separate from the rest of Vizio\u2019s software. \"It will stay completely up to date with all the Chromecast dongles in the field,\" says McRae. \"Google has the ability to update the Cast library at will.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"All of the innovation we\u2019re putting into Google Cast will be fed into the Vizio TVs, just as it is with the Chromecast. Their product will get better and better over time,\" says Queiroz. \"We\u2019re constantly updating the platform.\" The updates won\u2019t all happen simultaneously, but Queiroz says one of Google\u2019s goals is to keep the entire Cast ecosystem \"pure\" and in sync with feature updates.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We\u2019re building a great Cast experience, and they\u2019re building a great TV,\" says Queiroz. Google is open to other TV makers using Cast in the same way, but the company started with Vizio because they \"really wanted to get it right.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We\u2019re at the very start of this, but we think there\u2019s a lot more we can do,\" Queiroz says. \"There\u2019s a really huge ecosystem we can build here.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And building a huge ecosystem around a platform is the entire game in television right now.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"McManagal close-up\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t70ZAuDqTKYd2MhLuHunKSgU7rk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6227577/pbarshon_160317_0983_0353.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is an all-out smart TV platform war&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Vizio filed to go public last year, and the company\u2019s S-1 filing suggest that it was platform concerns that prompted McRae and his team to run away from a traditional smart TV platform strategy. \"We do not currently have arrangements with all of the popular content providers, including some content providers that are available on competitive devices, such as ESPN and HBO GO,\" the filing states in its risks section. \"Furthermore, our arrangements with our current content providers typically involve no significant long-term commitments\u2026 if we are unable to provide a competitive entertainment offering through our smart TV discovery and engagement software, our ability to attract and retain consumers would be harmed.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning: Vizio\u2019s current smart TV platform doesn\u2019t have some of the most popular services, and there\u2019s no guarantee any services will be available in the future. And the problem is getting worse: it\u2019s hard to imagine any video service having the time, resources, or desire to create apps for every platform in the massively fragmented smart TV landscape.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Samsung TVs run Tizen; LG TVs run webOS. Sony uses Android TV; Amazon\u2019s popular Fire TV devices run their own version of Android with a separate store and support. Roku has its own platform; the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 each demand custom apps. And Apple commands overwhelming developer interest and attention and has repurposed iOS into tvOS for the new Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is an all-out smart TV platform war, and a lot of people are going to suffer through a lot of badly-ported and hastily designed apps before it\u2019s all over.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When Netflix and Hulu update their Mobile apps, they\u2019re also updating the P-Series experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But by dropping any desire to put apps on the TV itself, Vizio completely sidesteps the platform war entirely. Every app in the Android and the iOS app stores that supports Google Cast is a P-Series app. And iOS and Android apps are the apps developers care about most, so they\u2019re often the best apps from a given service.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That means when Netflix and Hulu update their Android and iOS apps, they\u2019re also updating the P-Series experience. Vizio doesn\u2019t need to beg HBO and ESPN to support its TVs anymore, because they already support Google Cast \u2014 and thus the P-Series. There\u2019s no NFL Sunday Ticket app for the Apple TV, but the iOS and Android apps support Cast, so P-Series owners can pay to stream football.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And if a new app comes out that doesn\u2019t support Cast, Vizio has Google and millions of Chromecast owners to help make its case. \"Our goal is that every app is available on every Google Cast device,\" says Queiroz.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"From an actual engineering perspective, this TV is actually as complex and smart, if not more so, than any TV we\u2019ve ever made,\" says McRae. \"We\u2019ve just made it seem extraordinarily simple.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Vizio dock prototypes\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hi2zrXjoZGr7olncRGYIh8dER7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6227581/pbarshon_160317_0983_0311.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;Prototypes of Vizio's SmartCast tablet remote and wireless charging dock&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vizio isn\u2019t totally crazy.&lt;/strong&gt; The P-series will still accept the same IR remote commands as any other Vizio TV for power, input selection, and volume, and it even comes with a small standard remote in the box to control those settings. If you already have a Vizio TV and generally use a cable box or universal remote, you can swap a new P-series TV into your setup and perhaps never know the difference, apart from the upgraded picture quality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But McRae says testing reveals that most people only use the standard remote out of habit for a few days \u2014 then they switch to the tablet entirely. \"The pace of people moving to the tablet was faster than I would have told you before we got hundreds of these things in the field,\" he says. \"It was quicker than I think any of us had expected.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vizio\u2019s designers didn\u2019t want the tablet wandering around the house&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If all remotes have one thing in common, it\u2019s that they inevitably get lost. But Vizio\u2019s designers didn\u2019t want the tablet wandering around the house like any other device. \"We fumbled around with a few different ways of creating a home for the tablet,\" says Vizio design chief Scott McManigal. \"It really needed to have a connection to the TV.\" The work centered around rethinking what Vizio calls the \"ceremonies\" of using a television. \"This is something that should have a ceremonial home in the living room,\" says McRae. \"All those little ceremonies became really important.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the company had what McRae calls an \"aha\" moment in the P-Series design process: a wireless charging dock that uses magnets to pull the tablet down into alignment with a satisfying tug. The dock also holds the tablet upright so it can display notifications from across the room. If you have the SmartCast app open when you put it on the dock, it\u2019ll automatically return to the main control screen when you pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In testing, the team found that although the tablet has enough battery capacity for 14 days of standby, the dock led people to grab the tablet when they wanted to start using the TV and replace it when they were done \u2014 a new ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The team also decided to omit a TV power button from the tablet, a subtle, but calculated decision. With a standard TV, you walk into the room, grab the remote, and hit power to begin browsing for something to watch. But the Vizio team wanted to keep navigation focused on the tablet.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Vizio picking tablets\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9rYrdN9iMNp7_HLt6R375GBUKjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6227583/pbarshon_160317_0983_0269.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"If we had a hardware power button for the TV, we would have done something relatively stupid, because we were actually forcing an old ceremony on a new use case,\" says McRae. \"We went through hundreds of these things.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We don\u2019t have a separate team building our tablets, and then a separate team building our TVs,\" he adds, in obvious reference to Samsung. \"The tablet and TV were designed in a single room, by a single team. That\u2019s the only way you could do it.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"They have to go together,\" says McManigal. \"They\u2019re very paired to be a premium experience.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"The tablet and TV were designed in a single room, by a single team.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Early prototypes of the tablet also featured more customization of Android, but McManigal and his team decided against it. \"Our initial assumption was that you\u2019d want to have all the remote control buttons on the home screen,\" he says. \"But it just became very cluttered and very difficult to determine exactly which buttons you\u2019d need.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, the tablet remote features stock Android, which means Vizio can update it faster. It also means that the SmartCast app can work in mostly the same way on every other Android device \u2014 it doesn\u2019t rely on any custom features to show notifications or place playback controls in the notification shade.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The tablet also lacks an IR blaster \u2014 it\u2019s not a universal remote, and can\u2019t control anything else in your home theater rack just yet. But Vizio also happens to be the leading vendor of soundbars in America, and it\u2019s already showing off Cast-enabled soundbars and speakers. They\u2019ll come out later in the year, completing the ecosystem. \"Audio products with tiny little IR remotes are just horrible,\" says McRae. \"Exporting the navigation element out to a screen that you\u2019re familiar with changes how you interact. We\u2019re really excited about opening a new wave of interaction with the devices in your house.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Vizio TV insides\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ObS_CPNS-AiyWtXxsb6rmJes0eA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6227641/pbarshon_160317_0983_0052.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TVs have historically been&lt;/strong&gt; very, very dumb, and they\u2019re still among the dumbest gadgets in the home \u2014 for many people, they\u2019re just displays for smarter devices. Making them smart brings with it the same tradeoff as in the other smart devices in our lives: data collection can dramatically improve consumer experiences, but at the expense of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Vizio has stumbled into a couple privacy-related controversies in the past year: a class action lawsuit alleges that the company is collecting personal information on its customers. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s IPO filing revealed plans for a ratings service designed to compete with Nielsen by anonymously collecting over 100 billion data points a day from internet-connected Vizio televisions. McRae says the lawsuit is \"based on speculation\" and that Vizio will \"vigorously defend itself,\" but the ratings plans continue, and the technology is built into the P-Series.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The P-Series blurs the lines between television and mobile devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We collect data on an anonymous and aggregate level \u2014 there\u2019s no personal information collected at all. It\u2019s ratings,\" says McRae. \"We\u2019re using it to make the product better, and we\u2019re using it to improve user experiences. We believe that next-generation user experiences will benefit greatly from recommendations \u2014 knowing that people who like football also like to watch &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld.&lt;/em&gt; If a consumer feels uncomfortable with that, we want them to opt-out, and we\u2019re happy if they opt-out.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But new P-Series further blurs the lines between television and mobile devices. Mobile devices are built on tracking: both Apple and Google collect anonymous usage and diagnostic data from their phones unless you opt-out, and virtually every major mobile app contains analytics tracking code as well. Bringing television this far into the mobile era raises a new set of questions about what we\u2019re comfortable having tracked.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;McRae doesn\u2019t seem worried. \"[SmartCast] makes it a lot easier to actually communicate with end users and ask whether they want to opt-in or out. Moving navigation to a tablet is actually good at that. We want to make sure consumers are always comfortable interacting with the Vizio brand. We\u2019re trying to be as privacy-compliant and transparent as possible.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Vizio team whiteboard\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FnFNt_AhnA4QeG_t6rOIlNBh50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6227643/pbarshon_160317_0983_0224.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TVs are unwieldy things&lt;/strong&gt; that tend to get hung on a wall and stay there for a while \u2014 they don\u2019t get upgraded nearly as often as cellphones, tablets, and laptops. The displays might still look fine after a few years, but the processors quickly fall behind the curve and things get even slower and more irritating to use. Samsung has offered modular processor upgrades to combat this problem; Apple has stayed out of the TV hardware market in part because of it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But the new P-Series doesn\u2019t have any high-end processing in it \u2014 it just needs enough horsepower to decode and play a 4K HDR video stream over Google Cast. \"Look, the octo-core processor shouldn\u2019t be in the TV, it should be in the tablet you\u2019re holding,\" says McRae. \"You may buy a new phone a year from now that has even more horsepower. Guess what? You\u2019ll be able to play a new class of games and streaming that up to our television without having to buy a new TV.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Has Vizio invented its last TV?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Considering the bleeding-edge 4K HDR display in the P-Series, that seems like it could make the upgrade cycle even longer. I ask McRae if Vizio has just invented its last TV.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We don\u2019t worry about device life cycle,\" he says, very seriously. \"Our job is to build the best product we can build and have it last and be relevant to you for as long as possible.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The P-Series represents a simple-seeming but incredibly bold bet on what consumers find relevant in a television \u2014 a bet that the only thing worth displaying on a TV screen is content, not navigation. It\u2019s a bet that people, especially younger people who\u2019ve never had cable, will want to buy a TV that\u2019s actually just a second screen for their phones. &amp;nbsp;And it\u2019s a bet that Vizio can keep coming up with new ways to convince you to upgrade your TV.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"Every time we build the TV that will end all TVs, especially when it comes to picture quality, there are new boundaries we can push,\" says McRae. \"We\u2019ve got at least another three to five years of continuing to push the envelope on color and dynamic range.

That October, Mrs. Obama held a Vine Q&amp;amp;A for her Let\u2019s Move! initiative, calling on kids and their families to send in video questions about healthy eating, cooking, and gardening. Over the course of five days, she answered a series of family-friendly queries ranging from \"What\u2019s your favorite fall vegetable?\" (sweet potato) to \"What\u2019s your favorite food memory?\" (getting pizza as a reward for good grades). It was cute, but not especially memorable.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Then, YouTube star and President Obama impersonator Iman \"Alphacat\" Crosson chimed in. \"On average,\" he asked the First Lady in his best Obama baritone, \"how many calories do you burn every time you turn up?\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Obama\u2019s team seized the opportunity. The next day, members of the White House\u2019s Office of Digital Strategy and Joanna Rosholm, the First Lady\u2019s press secretary, suggested a riff on \"Turn Down for What.\" Rosholm called down to the kitchen: was there a turnip in the White House? Mrs. Obama got the joke right away. \"I know who Lil Jon is,\" she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; \"My kids are singing it. I got it immediately, and I was like, \u2018Okay, that could be cute.\u2019\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"flotus_desktop\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Portrait of Michelle Obama on orange background\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zc5n75DPBz9db14Sr1d759jaSIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6168175/jbareham_160114_0931_0177_landscape.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"flotus_mobile\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Portrait of Michelle Obama on orange background\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/msjbFWQwkF8kAlaYhYwSa7jt0uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6168183/jbareham_160114_0931_0177_b.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Within minutes of seeing Crosson\u2019s vine, the First Lady was in FDR\u2019s Map Room, filming her response. \"Turnip \u2014 for what,\" she deadpanned into the camera, a glorious purple and white root vegetable in hand. The bass dropped and Mrs. Obama closed her eyes, bouncing to the beat.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Simple and self-consciously silly, the Vine racked up more than six million views in a single day. The headlines were effusive: \"Michelle Obama Makes Best Vine Ever for \u2018Turnip For What\u2019\" wrote &lt;em&gt;Jezebel.&lt;/em&gt; \"Best Vine Ever\" cried &lt;em&gt;Us Weekly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt; &lt;iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"600\" width=\"600\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/OqJKZVQami9/embed/simple\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=\"https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For decades, social initiatives have been a mainstay of the First Lady\u2019s office: for Lady Bird Johnson, it was the environment; for former librarian Laura Bush, literacy. Over the last seven years, Mrs. Obama has focused on four major initiatives: Reach Higher, for teens pursuing higher learning; Let\u2019s Move!, to fight childhood obesity; Let Girls Learn, for educating women and girls around the world; and Joining Forces, for aiding veterans and their families.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But Mrs. Obama\u2019s tenure also coincided with the rise of social media: during the Obama presidency, Twitter went from upstart to global newswire; Facebook now counts over 1.5 billion users; and Instagram and Snapchat \u2014 platforms that didn\u2019t exist a decade ago \u2014 dominate pop culture. With a click of an iPhone, Mrs. Obama can now reach audiences Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Bush could only have dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene1\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center\"&gt;\"People can get to know me directly. They can see that I\u2019m kind of silly sometimes, that I care.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"[Social media] bypasses the middle man,\" Mrs. Obama says. \"People can get to know me directly. They can see that I\u2019m kind of silly sometimes, that I care. They can feel the passion, [and] they don\u2019t have to have it filtered through another source. And young people in particular like that.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We knew long ago [that] any time we\u2019re doing any sort of communications for the First Lady there needs to be a digital component,\" says Caroline Adler, the First Lady\u2019s communications director. \"Increasingly, there\u2019s no real way to connect directly with audiences except digitally.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Outside experts speak highly of the First Lady\u2019s efforts. \"She\u2019s really mastered the medium,\" says Michelle Barna-Stern, VP of social marketing at digital ad firm 360i. \"She\u2019s personable. She\u2019s accessible. She\u2019s authentic, relatable. And she also has such a great sense of humor.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But social media is a double-edged sword: one tone-deaf tweet, poorly-timed Vine, or thoughtless Facebook post can spell embarrassment. That\u2019s unlikely with the in-house social media task force Mrs. Obama has built: a close-knit collection of strategists, initiative directors, and managers who work to craft a digital portrait of a First Lady at once cool, caring, and in touch. A First Lady who can turn up with a turnip and make the country swoon, but still advance serious initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;figure class=\"panorama\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div data-paver=\"1\" data-start-position=\"0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6187259/vrg_pano_final.0.png\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=\"recenter\"&gt;Re-center&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"p-dropcap\"&gt;It\u2019s a little-known fact that the First Lady\u2019s office doesn\u2019t have any Congressional authority or any independent funding,\" says Adler.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We got nothing!\" adds Mrs. Obama, cracking the room up.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s mid-January, and a large team from &lt;i&gt;The Verge&lt;/i&gt; is at the White House filming the first ever 360-degree video interview with the First Lady and getting a glimpse into her social media hit factory. Mrs. Obama is swarmed by stylists, staffers, and countless camera operators. Amid the chaos she is warm and funny, playfully ribbing her staff and poking fun at &lt;i&gt;The Verge&lt;/i&gt; delegation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene2\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"layer right\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center\"&gt;The Obamas are \"uniquely able to be authentic, in a bunch of new ways and through a bunch of new channels.\"&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After the interview, I shake hands with the First Lady, introducing myself as the writer who has been meeting with her staff.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"Hopefully everyone behaved themselves!\" she says, throwing an eye around the room. We\u2019d arranged for a shot with several younger staffers taking selfies with the First Lady, and the atmosphere is lively as people crowd around the monitors to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"Almost!\" I joke.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"Alright, we\u2019ll take names later,\" she quips back with obvious affection for her team. The room breaks into laughter once again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;George W. Bush was the president you could get a beer with, but no one accused him or Laura of being cool. Bill Clinton was personable, but his cool ended at playing the sax. Hillary\u2019s cool is detached and technocratic, raw power wielding a Blackberry behind sunglasses on a private jet. But the Obamas are different: the president reportedly texts with Jay Z and calls private meetings with Kendrick Lamar \u2014 his favorite rapper \u2014 in the Oval Office; the First Lady counts Beyonc\u00e9 as a personal friend, and isn\u2019t afraid to show off some Mom Dances on &lt;em&gt;The Tonight Show.&lt;/em&gt; Kyle Lierman, the White House\u2019s associate director of public engagement, says the Obamas are \"uniquely able to be authentic, in a bunch of new ways and through a bunch of new channels.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Obamas\u2019 charisma in front of crowds and cameras makes them natural ambassadors to a younger generation. And their two young daughters Sasha and Malia give them insight into what resonates \u2014 and more importantly, what doesn\u2019t. \"I\u2019ve got two Gen Zers living under my roof,\" says Mrs. Obama. \"They don\u2019t think we\u2019re cool at all. But I know what they\u2019re watching on Vine, and I know what they\u2019re giggling about.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When President Obama was a guest on Zach Galifianakis\u2019 &lt;em&gt;Between Two Ferns&lt;/em&gt; to promote the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the first time a sitting president appeared in an online series \u2014 even Sasha and Malia were impressed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene3\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"layer left\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;q class=\"center\"&gt;When President Obama was a guest on Between Two Ferns, even Sasha and Malia were impressed&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We\u2019re talking at the dinner table about his day,\" says Mrs. Obama, drawing the scene. \"Maybe he talked to Putin, maybe he\u2019s talking about a nuclear deal. But the minute he said, \u2018Yeah, and I taped this thing &lt;em&gt;Between Two Ferns,&lt;/em&gt;\u2019 Malia was like, \u2018What?\u2019 The conversation stopped.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"This generation, they\u2019re looking for authenticity, they\u2019re looking for what feels real and natural,\" Mrs. Obama went on. \"We know we have to meet young people where they are \u2014 they\u2019re not watching the nightly news, they\u2019re not watching the Sunday morning shows, they\u2019re not reading the newspapers. They\u2019re on their phones.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The shift to digital communication has been a boon for an office with a limited budget: Mrs. Obama\u2019s team can now reach millions of young people at almost no cost and sidestep time-intensive bureaucracy. \"We have to be very entrepreneurial, find opportunities and amplify them with surprisingly limited resources,\" observes Adler. \"It\u2019s a lot like a startup.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Harvard grad who previously worked for the State Department under Hillary Clinton, Adler is poised and professional, always ready to expand on Mrs. Obama\u2019s points. That quickly becomes a theme as I talk with the staff: the First Lady sets the goals and has the natural charisma to connect to her audience, but it\u2019s the team that does the hard work of developing strategy, coming up with ideas, and vetting some out-there pitches.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;\n  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Portrait of Michelle Obama on orange background\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E9mvZVFiCfyH7g0nawjasRXNHkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6168181/jbareham_160114_0931_0153.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"caption\"&gt;From left to right: Maggie Morrow, Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff;  Hugh McDermott, scheduler to the First Lady; Julia Kim, Former Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff; Sriramya Gainedi, Special Assistant to Chief of Staff; Joseph Mahshie, Trip Coordinator; Kristina Broadie, Deputy Associate Director of Social Office&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"p-dropcap\"&gt;If 2014 was the year of turning up, 2015 was the year of the dab. Cam Newton\u2019s signature touchdown dance move went viral as his Carolina Panthers made a Super Bowl run. Suddenly, everyone was dabbing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Would the First Lady dab for &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; we asked? It seemed like a surefire viral sensation. And Hillary Clinton had just dabbed on &lt;em&gt;Ellen,&lt;/em&gt; perhaps the ultimate sign of broad cultural acceptance. It couldn\u2019t be safer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene4\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"layer right\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;q class=\"center\"&gt;Would the First Lady dab for The Verge?&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Rosholm, the First Lady\u2019s press secretary, laughed at the idea but promised to inquire. She took the pitch to Mrs. Obama\u2019s inner social media quorum: her communications team and the Office of Digital Strategy. Every day, these groups meet to discuss initiatives and figure out how best to execute them across the many platforms used by the White House and First Lady. (Those platforms include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Spotify; the White House had just launched on Snapchat when we visited.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Frequently, these conversations pull in the White House Social Secretary, as well as the First Lady\u2019s Office of Presidential Correspondence and the Office of Public Engagement. Mrs. Obama sits at the center, listening to pitches, giving feedback, and ultimately making the executive decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"There\u2019s a misconception that social media is simple, because technically anyone can get on Twitter and get on Facebook,\" says 360i\u2019s Barna-Stern. \"There\u2019s a tremendous amount of strategy, thought, and investment that really goes into it. What\u2019s clear is that [Mrs. Obama] has an understanding of how to utilize the platforms and social media best practices in order to reach her goals.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jason Goldman, the White House Chief Digital Officer recruited from stints at Google, Twitter, and Medium, says the team\u2019s decisions happen quickly. \"I\u2019ve been completely surprised at how much faster this place feels than working in startups,\" he says. Goldman has a laid-back demeanor but becomes animated when discussing social media. \"The advantage of these platforms over traditional media is that they\u2019re very measurable. You get feedback on what people like, and what works.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene5\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;q class=\"center\"&gt; \"The First Lady is \u2026 the one asking us to do more, to figure out new platforms we can use to break new ground.\"&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In my conversations with Mrs. Obama\u2019s team, it became clear that they care about views, clicks, and engagement as much as any media organization. The term the staff uses over and over is \"land\" \u2014 will a piece of media land? Will people engage and participate in the message it\u2019s sending?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We\u2019re looking for the right moment to land \u2014 it might land a week later, or it might land two years later,\" says Kori Schulman, the Deputy Director of Digital Strategy under Goldman. \"We\u2019re actually in an amazing position where the First Lady is, many times, the one asking us to do more, to figure out new platforms we can use to break new ground.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"It\u2019s exciting because it\u2019s uncharted territory,\" adds Krishanti Vignarajah, Mrs. Obama\u2019s policy director. \"But it\u2019s also daunting.\" A Marshall scholar with a law degree from Yale, Vignarajah advises the First Lady on international affairs. \"When we launched the Let Girls Learn playlist, it was like, \u2018Is this actually going to get any traction? Is this an interesting way to engage?\u2019 This leads to internal debates about what will land.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Obama puts it more bluntly: \"We always say, \u2018Well, can we make it go viral? Can we make it? Is it gonna? Is it going to resonate?\u2019\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But there\u2019s another component: whether all those views actually have an impact. And that impact \u2014 the counterpoint to landing \u2014 is &lt;em&gt;conversation&lt;/em&gt;. In my talks with the staff, the word \"conversation\" was uttered 50 times. (I counted.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene6\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"layer right\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;q class=\"center\"&gt; Mrs. Obama puts it more bluntly: \"Can we make it go viral?\"&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"[Mrs. Obama] always tries to use social media not just to speak to people, but to get them to be part of the conversation,\" says Vignarajah. The First Lady wants her audience \u2014 young children, teenagers, parents, and soldiers \u2014 to discuss the issues she\u2019s advocating for.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"It took an entire decade for people to understand that the internet is fundamentally a platform of human conversation,\" says Goldman. \"It\u2019s about participating.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the dab was rejected: after consulting with the team, Rosholm told us that dabbing\u2019s hazy connection to marijuana culture ruled it out. Hillary Clinton could dab all she wanted to, but the First Lady would abstain.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Portrait of Michelle Obama on orange background\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZwsa_sRdXE7craEln7kyZLDwVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6168177/jbareham_160114_0931_0171.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"p-dropcap\"&gt;Of all her platforms, the First Lady truly shines on Vine, where the White House has over 436,000 followers. The six-second video platform is perfect for her mix of straight talk and goofy humor. And to help push her initiatives, the First Lady\u2019s team calls on Vine superstars, users that Mrs. Obama casually refers to as \"VIVers,\" or Very Important Viners.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;VIVers Michael and Carissa Rae Alvarado met in 2011 as extras on a music video shoot in Los Angeles. There was \"instant chemistry,\" Michael says, and by 2012 the pair was married. At around the same time, they started filming themselves on Vine performing covers under a new name: Us the Duo. &amp;nbsp;Their renditions of hits like Lana Del Rey\u2019s \"Summertime Sadness\" and Blackstreet\u2019s \"No Diggity\" earned them five million Vine followers, spots on network morning shows, and eventually, label attention. In March 2014, the Alvarados became the first Vine musicians signed with a major label. They\u2019ve released two albums so far, and are preparing to put out a third independently.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene7\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer right\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;q class=\"center\"&gt;The First Lady truly shines on Vine&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Last October, the First Lady invited Us the Duo to the White House to help promote Better Make Room, an initiative that encourages teens to \"make room\" in their senior year schedules for the college application process.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"When you get a call that says Michelle Obama wants to meet with you, you stop whatever you\u2019re gonna do and make it happen,\" says Michael. Us the Duo were joined by five other VIVers for the three-hour event: Lele Pons, King Bach, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Jarre, Amymarie Gaertner, and Chris Melberger.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For their Vines, Us the Duo sang a Better Make Room-inspired cover of Fifth Harmony\u2019s \"Bo$$\"; King Bach slid into the scene woefully underdressed in basketball shorts before moonwalking his way out to Justin Bieber\u2019s \"Sorry\"; and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Jarre gave an impromptu French lesson. In all, the VIVers produced nine pieces of content that have generated more than 91.7 million views to date.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt; &lt;iframe src=\"https://vine.co/v/e9InPQd6xMI/embed/simple\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=\"https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"This group of five Viners\u2026 they had 41 million followers between them,\" says Eric Waldo, a five-year veteran of the Department of Education who now spearheads the Reach Higher campaign. \"And after we put out videos with them, suddenly kids knew what we were talking about. We had kids coming in here saying, \u2018I saw the video King Bach did.\u2019 That\u2019s incredible.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left q-animated\" id=\"scene8\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer left\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;q class=\"center\"&gt; \"After we put out videos \u2026 suddenly kids knew what we were talking about.\"&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The partnerships aren\u2019t limited to Vine. Mrs. Obama\u2019s team recognizes that while she may be one of the most influential people on the planet, she still needs help reaching certain audiences. For example, the First Lady\u2019s YouTube channel for Let\u2019s Move! has just 15,691 followers. So she\u2019ll partner with millennial flypaper like CollegeHumor and Funny Or Die to film shorts about the so-called \"Snackpocalypse\" featuring stars Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Tyler Posey to promote healthy eating; or do an off-the-cuff interview with Tyler Oakley, who has more than eight million YouTube subscribers, to talk education.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the content produced during these partnerships addresses Mrs. Obama\u2019s initiatives head-on; others touch on them only obliquely. The trick, says Waldo, is a light touch.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"The success of our model isn\u2019t to just read the same PSA and say, \u2018Please make sure you go to college,\u2019\" he says. \"She\u2019s going to rap with Jay Pharoah and have a sense of humor and make fun of herself a little bit.\" That approach makes Mrs. Obama seem more accessible, slowly but surely raising awareness with each share.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet full-image\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Portrait of Michelle Obama on orange background\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yW7Bcl2sr7bLWPVD6zZXmI_B3Uw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6168173/jbareham_160114_0931_0215.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"p-dropcap\"&gt;But how far can any social media campaign take Mrs. Obama\u2019s initiatives? Can a hashtag reduce childhood obesity? Can a Vine improve college enrollment? \"I think we have been able to move the needle on a range of issues,\" says the First Lady. \"When we first came into office, there were people questioning whether childhood obesity was even an issue. Now we\u2019re seeing the conversation has in fact changed.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right q-animated\" id=\"scene9\" data-scalar-x=\"20\" data-scalar-y=\"20\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"layer right\" data-depth=\"1.0\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;q class=\"center\"&gt;Can a hashtag reduce childhood obesity?&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The numbers partially bear out her belief in the power of conversation: in 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that obesity fell drastically in children ages 2-5, though overall it remained unchanged across children 2-18. At 3.9 percent, the veteran unemployment rate is at its lowest in eight years.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But other numbers point to harder issues: between 2008 and 2013, overall college enrollment dropped from 69 percent to 66 percent. And UNESCO reports that equal access to primary and secondary schooling has reached less than half of the world\u2019s countries, leaving millions of girls around the world without an education. Starting online conversations might raise awareness of these issues, but long-term change will require that those conversations turn into real action.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet\"&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Portrait of Michelle Obama on orange background\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrmpAzNKrCtYU1HJXysY5FjzenM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6168163/jbareham_160114_0931_0272.0.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"m-snippet thin\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the country has its eyes locked on six would-be Commanders-in-Chief, each with their own social media strategy: Hillary Clinton has arguably the strongest Instagram account of any of the contenders; Bernie Sanders supporters are feeling the Bern on Tumblr; Ted Cruz trolls Donald Trump on Snapchat; and Trump himself has created a movement partly through his powerful and unparalleled use of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Whichever administration enters the White House in 2017 will be building on the Obamas\u2019 foundation. There will never be another \"First Digital Presidency.\" And it may be a long time before another \"Turnip for What?\" The Obamas have set a high social media bar for the next First Family \u2014 and they\u2019re not quite done yet.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"This platform is so unique,\" Mrs. Obama says of the White House. \"We will never have it again. So we will spend these twelve months on every issue making sure we\u2019re driving to the very end. We figure we want to drop the mic on some of this stuff.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"credit\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published on March 14, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"credit\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"credit\"&gt;Executive Producers: Nilay Patel, Tre Shallowhorn  &lt;br&gt;Director: Tom Connors  &lt;br&gt;Director of Photography: Ian McAlpin &lt;br&gt;Art Director: James Bareham  &lt;br&gt;Sound Design: Andrew Marino &lt;br&gt;Post Production Supervisors: Miriam Nielsen, Noah Shulman  &lt;br&gt;Animation: Marcus Mullins, Scott Waraniak of Lunar North  &lt;br&gt;Color: Max Jeffrey  &lt;br&gt;VR Producers: Craig Gilbert of Total Cinema 360, Lucas Wilson of Supersphere Production &lt;br&gt;VR Operators: Joergen Geerds, Mark Walden&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"credit\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"credit\"&gt;Josh Laincz, Kelsey Scherer, Jason Santa Maria, Tyson Whiting&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"credit\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"credit\"&gt;Nilay Patel, Michael Zelenko&lt;br&gt;Copy-editor: Aaron Mat\u00e9&lt;br&gt; Editorial assistance:  Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-throttle-debounce/1.1/jquery.ba-throttle-debounce.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6163739/jquery.paver.min.0.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6185409/paver_init.0.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;!--\r\nvar scene1 = document.getElementById('scene1');\r\nvar parallax1 = new Parallax(scene1);\r\nvar scene2 = document.getElementById('scene2');\r\nvar parallax2 = new Parallax(scene2);\r\nvar scene3 = document.getElementById('scene3');\r\nvar parallax3 = new Parallax(scene3);\r\nvar scene4 = document.getElementById('scene4');\r\nvar parallax4 = new Parallax(scene4);\r\nvar scene5 = document.getElementById('scene5');\r\nvar parallax5 = new Parallax(scene5);\r\nvar scene6 = document.getElementById('scene6');\r\nvar parallax6 = new Parallax(scene6);\r\nvar scene7 = document.getElementById('scene7');\r\nvar parallax7 = new Parallax(scene7);\r\nvar scene8 = document.getElementById('scene8');\r\nvar parallax8 = new Parallax(scene8);\r\nvar scene9 = document.getElementById('scene9');\r\nvar parallax9 = new Parallax(scene9);\r\nif( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) {\r\n $('body').addClass('mobile_device');\r\n}\r\n// --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n</content>\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/14/11179572/first-lady-michelle-obama-vr-interview-social-media-pictures\"/>\n    <id>http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/14/11179572/first-lady-michelle-obama-vr-interview-social-media-pictures</id>\n    <author>\n      <name>Kwame Opam</name>\n    </author>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <published>2016-03-09T10:00:41-05:00</published>\n    <updated>2016-03-09T10:00:41-05:00</updated>\n    <title>The Dragonslayer</title>\n    <content type=\"html\">  \n  &lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPFy8Di_fp-4WOu20fnyPUt-KUk=/77x0:2422x1563/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49029027/vrg_0956_wheeler_lede.0.0.png\" /&gt;\n\n\n\n  &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, John Oliver called Tom Wheeler a dingo.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The host of &lt;em&gt;Last Week Tonight&lt;/em&gt; had set his sights on the then-raging net neutrality debate, acerbically calling out broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon for their throttling antics and intense Congressional lobbying.

The path from a Commission seat to an aisle seat inside Comcast\u2019s private jet and vice versa has been wide open for years: former FCC Chairman Michael Powell is now the president of the National Cable and Telecom Association, which counts Comcast as its largest member. Former FCC Commissioner Meredith Baker\u2026. left the agency to work for Comcast. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But Wheeler pushed back against Oliver and various other critics (&lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/25/5431382/the-internet-is-fucked\"&gt;including me&lt;/a&gt;) who felt the FCC was soft-pedaling on net neutrality and on regulating telecom companies in general. And in the past year of his chairmanship, the FCC has turned into a sharply pro-consumer and pro-competition agency: with the passage of the Open Internet Order, net neutrality is now the law; upcoming rules will prevent carriers from collecting and selling user data without permission; a spectrum auction next month will lay the groundwork for 5G mobile internet; and now Wheeler has his sights set on making TV providers open their cable networks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking exclusively to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the day before he appeared in front of Congressional Republicans investigating the net neutrality vote, Wheeler was candid and direct about his desire to protect upstarts. \"You know my mantra,\" he says. \"Competition, competition, competition.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Far from being captured by telecom companies, Wheeler seems to relish the insight his lobbying history has given him about their operations. And he\u2019s using that insight to fight the multi-headed dragons of the television, wireless, and broadband industries on multiple battlefields, all at once.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And he\u2019s winning.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;   &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Wheeler section break\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9HWOJEO-7qAz1FYGYERW-f7iaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6164015/vrg_0969_wheeler_text_break_02.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n &lt;/center&gt; &lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nilay Patel: So Oliver called you a dingo \u2014&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Tom Wheeler: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014 Because he was upset you were put in charge of regulating an industry you first represented. It\u2019s been about a year since you passed net neutrality, and you\u2019re back at it with the push to unlock cable boxes. It seems like something\u2019s changed \u2014 like your approach has gotten more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m the same guy I was then. I think it\u2019s just that people didn\u2019t know who I was.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What was the cable industry like when I was lobbying for them? They were the underdog. They were the folks trying to climb up the hill, and broadcasters and telephone companies tried to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What was the wireless industry like when I was there? They were the young guys coming up the side of the mountain. What was I doing when I was a VC? I was funding startup companies that were challenging the incumbents.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;My heart has always been with the insurgents, not the incumbents. And nobody stopped to really look at that \u2014 they just wanted to make this judgement. But I\u2019m the same guy I always was.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"My heart has always been with the insurgents, not incumbents.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s start with net neutrality. It\u2019s been a year since it passed, but there\u2019s still &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/6/9857598/fcc-net-neutrality-hearing-oral-arguments-dc-court-of-appeals/in/7742856\"&gt;a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; challenging it, and the Senate Republicans just &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=senate+republicans+report+FCC+net+neutrality\"&gt;put out a report&lt;/a&gt; saying President Obama inappropriately and secretly influenced the FCC into regulating broadband providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. So I\u2019ll ask you directly: when did you decide to push for the stricter Title II regulations?&lt;span class=\"footnote-source\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"footnote\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Wheeler\u2019s initial approach to net neutrality was much looser, relying on the FCC\u2019s broad authority to \"promote broadband competition\" to set rules. After intense public outcry, the Oliver video, and a push from Obama, Wheeler switched to the much stricter Title II approach.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Title II has always been on the table. As we went through the process it began to be really clear that the \"commercially reasonable\" test was untried. I was comfortable I could apply it, but after I was gone somebody would look back and say, \"Oh, this means \u2018reasonable for the commercial entity.\u2019\" That\u2019s the wrong interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But as you know we\u2019d always had Title II in the [proposal]. Then I coupled that with my experience representing the wireless industry \u2014 we went to Congress and asked to be made common carriers!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So it was that kind of an evolutionary process. This idea that there were some kind of secret instructions from the White House has been around for more than a year, and I\u2019m sure it will be around a year from now. It\u2019s a quick and easy take, but it\u2019s a quick, easy, and &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; take.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The second allegation is that the staff of the FCC raised concerns internally about needing more comment. Do you have a response to that?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the job of the staff, to constantly say, \"Wait a minute, what are the details here, and are we building the record as it needs to be built?\"And as you know I pushed [it]. I was hoping to move on [net neutrality] in November, and I said, \"Nope! We\u2019re not ready!\" I said that publicly. I didn\u2019t say it as some kind of secret thing. I actually put out a statement saying, \"We\u2019re going to hit pause because we need to continue to develop the record.\" And if you go to the lawsuit one of the things that they\u2019re arguing right now is that we didn\u2019t do a good job building a record. So I guess it made sense to pause.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So that lawsuit is out there, and the telecom companies seem to be actively pursuing that lawsuit. Why do you think Congress is deciding to wade into this mess now?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"You\u2019re asking me to interpret the Republicans in Congress?\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You gotta ask them! [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;] You\u2019re asking me to interpret the Republicans in Congress? I\u2019m the least qualified person in America to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And now we\u2019re seeing a bunch of wireless carriers do sponsored data and zero rating,&lt;span class=\"footnote-source\"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; which seems like they might violate net neutrality. T-Mobile\u2019s BingeOn is the most interesting to me \u2014 I don\u2019t know where I stand on it. They\u2019re throttling data \u2014&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"footnote\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Zero rating is the controversial practice of excusing certain apps and services from data caps, which effectively makes everything else more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Why do you think that\u2019s more interesting than Go90? Just out of curiosity.&lt;span class=\"footnote-source\"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"footnote\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Verizon\u2019s new video service Go90 doesn\u2019t count against the data cap for Verizon\u2019s mobile customers; Verizon says Go90 is an independent subsidiary that pays for sponsored data just like any other company.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;My take is that Go90 is actually way worse. It\u2019s a separate company inside Verizon and they\u2019re straight-up paying to have their data privileged. With T-Mobile they\u2019re at least doing a blanket throttle and affecting everyone equally.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Either way it seems like a lot of carriers are trying to dance through the bright line rules of net neutrality. Where do you stand?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We were quite specific in the Open Internet Order saying we weren\u2019t going to address zero rating because we could argue it both ways.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You can see where it\u2019s helpful if it reduces cost and increases choice. You can see where it\u2019s harmful if it discourages and discriminates. So it\u2019s the poster child for why we wanted to make sure we had a general conduct rule in place. What we\u2019re doing right now is looking at the various schemes that have been developed, and we\u2019ve asked folks on multiple sides of the issue to come in and sit down and help us understand so we can think our way through this.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I think the key to the Open Internet Order is the concept of regulatory agility. And zero rating is a classic example of that. I can argue there are some aspects of it that are good, and I can argue there\u2019s some aspects of it that are not so good. The job of the regulator is to figure out, \"Okay, now how do I deal with this?\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So do you see a distinction between Go90 and BingeOn?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t wanna get into that, but that\u2019s the issue that I\u2019m wrestling with.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So zero rating is the current net neutrality battle. Where do you think it goes from here? What\u2019s your next battle?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think the boundaries will be?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt; \"Why is the information generated by an internet search different?\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are three key concepts: One, that [broadband companies] are collecting data on me and it isn\u2019t being held securely. Two, they\u2019re collecting data on me and they ought to be telling me what they\u2019re collecting and what it's being used for. And three, I ought to have the choice to say whether I want them to do that or not.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When these companies were operating as phone companies, the information generated by a phone call couldn\u2019t be released unless the consumer said so. You\u2019ve got to ask yourself the question: why is the information generated by an internet search different?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;All the carriers told me that Title II is an existential threat to their business, and there\u2019s a lawsuit and Congressional hearings to challenge it. Meanwhile, these companies are trying to sidestep the rules with sponsored data. Verizon bought AOL for ad tech and now you\u2019re going after how they can use that data.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s three battlegrounds and now you want to tackle cable box unlocking. Do you have enough time to get this done?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re here now, and we\u2019re not going to be here a year from now. Why should you sit around and just think about doing things? Do \u2018em!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So let\u2019s get into cable box unlocking. &lt;span class=\"footnote-source\"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; No one\u2019s really thought about it for a long time. When I go and talk to the cable companies, they say, \"Look, we\u2019re doing apps!\" as their solution to freeing up the content. What do you say to that? Why do we still need to worry about the hardware if they\u2019re going to move to the app model?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"footnote\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Wheeler just passed a proposal that would require TV providers to allow any device to access TV programming; right now nearly every TV service has a proprietary cable or satellite box. The cable companies hate this, of course.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m fascinated by that response, because the reality is there\u2019s nothing different about an app. An app is just doing things in software that used to be done in hardware. The question is whether the app is open or closed. And if they close the app it\u2019s just as awful as a closed piece of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The cable companies all say that they\u2019re the ones that go out and negotiate with video programmers and networks, and spend all the money on content. What\u2019s the argument to unbundle their stuff and let it be open to every app?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody is saying to the cable operator that they have to change anything that they do, other than provide access to competitive boxes. And the law is pretty clear: it says there needs to be competitive navigation devices. Well, let\u2019s obey the law! I don\u2019t know whether you saw the open meeting where we voted on this 3-2, but I threw up on the screen a 2010 letter from NCTA endorsing the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But that was their previous plan, with CableCard and then Tru2Way, which totally failed.&lt;span class=\"footnote-source\"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; They were gonna own the middleware\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"footnote\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Previous efforts to allow other devices to connect to cable networks have been complicated, buggy, and failed spectacularly. How bad was it? Comcast CEO Brian Roberts once tried to convince Steve Jobs to build a cable box and Jobs refused because he wouldn\u2019t use the required software.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I thought&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11039542/comcast-open-cable-boxes-brian-roberts-fcc\"&gt;your article&lt;/a&gt; on this was terrific. When you quoted Brian Roberts saying \"say goodbye to the set-top box\" [at CES 2008] and he brought out the guy from Panasonic, I thought that was a terrific piece of reporting.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"Nvidia now has a $50 box, but the cable operators refuse to interface with it.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Folks like Mitsubishi have said on the record that they wanted to build something but the cable operators wouldn\u2019t give them access. Nvidia now has a $50 box, but the cable operators refuse to interface with it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I am just dumbfounded by the response because they have no difficulty interfacing with an iPad. They have no difficulty interfacing with Google Android. This would work exactly the same way, and all of the sudden it\u2019s the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve chronicled all of these TV product failures in one way or another, and I\u2019m surprised the tech companies aren\u2019t way out in front providing you cover on open navigation. But when we go to ask Google, Microsoft, and Apple about cable boxes, they all have no comment. Have you heard from them? Do you feel support from Silicon Valley?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not what\u2019s driving us, and it\u2019s not essential to this. I mean, this is a simple question. There are two things intersecting. One is the law, which is black letter and very explicit. And the second is technology that finally allows a solution other than this cobbled-together CableCard solution. So, okay, we exist at the point in time where technology is allowing something like this to happen, and the law has said for the past 20 years that it should happen. Alright, let\u2019s make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This feels connected to net neutrality, at least in spirit. They are metaphorically analogous\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s about openness. It\u2019s all about openness.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But there\u2019s something much more real underneath it. A company like Time Warner Cable provides both video and broadband services, and they\u2019re trying to build streaming skinny bundles, because broadband service is a much higher margin. Is there a conflict here?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our job is not to balance things out and pick winners or losers. Our job is to let the market work. You know my mantra is \"competition, competition, competition.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Let me take this in another direction. We started this conversation and you said you\u2019ve always represented the upstart. And the first few sets of upstarts you described were access-layer technology upstarts: cable TV, wireless internet. Is there another internet access technology you see that can provide competition to wired and wireless broadband? Or is that infrastructure so fixed in place now that we need to focus on competition in the layers above?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What a great question! And I don\u2019t have the answer for that, Nilay.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But here\u2019s the thing that is fascinating to me: those networks are built on assumptions from the industrial economy, i.e. scope and scale assumptions. But digital networks operate at zero marginal cost. There is an inherent conflict between those two. Zero marginal cost has allowed us to have all of these great innovations like the app economy and the web.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, you need to be producing a return on that investment. But you know, the situation right now is that the revenue per subscriber for the broadband providers has gone up since the Open Internet Order went into place. &lt;span class=\"footnote-source\"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"footnote\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The FCC says this claim is based on an \"internal analysis.\" The public numbers we looked at seemed to indicate that these figures are mostly flat.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"We\u2019re living through an evolution from industrial economics to digital economics.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Which of course is logical because people are buying more, because more is available. It makes all the sense in the world. We\u2019re living through an evolution from industrial economics to digital economics. And that will, by far, outlast my tenure here, but it\u2019s the underpinning of what\u2019s going to happen over the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But there are still wires in the ground and antennas in the air. There\u2019s a lot of industrial scale work that needs to get done.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019re walking away from the issues \u2014 you need to get a return on that. But the interesting thing was you used to have to build when you wanted to increase the capacity of a telephone line. You had to build a new circuit, right? But when you want to increase the capacity of fiber you put on new electronics. And the economics of both of those are huge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You see AT&amp;amp;T and others talking about how they\u2019re going to software-defined networks \u2014 the cost of software-defined networks are a fraction of the cost of hardware-defined networks. The economic model is changing. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re living through an evolution between two ways of approaching the world. That\u2019s fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re talking about wired and wireless in the same breath. The Open Internet Order wiped away the idea that wireless is special enough to be regulated differently. But I still constantly hear the wireless companies say there\u2019s a spectrum crunch and that\u2019s why they have to do things like zero rating. You seem to be saying that that model should be fading away.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;No, I think that there is a spectrum issue. I mean there\u2019s no doubt about it\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Do you think crunch is as bad as they tell me?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Well, you know, I\u2019m 28 days away from running a spectrum auction. [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;] So I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going there, Nilay.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You should be saying there\u2019s no spectrum left \u2014 you should be running up the prices!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"It\u2019s the last sale! Last chance to get a lease!\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s the last sale! Last chance to get a lease! [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But as you bring up software defined radios, they are able to mine more capacity out of a fixed amount of spectrum. Do you think that that brings the economics in line with what they\u2019re able to do on the fiber side or is it actually different?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I think it\u2019s different in a whole bunch of ways. So for instance, we always talk about this thing called \"reasonable network management.\" Network management for a wireless network is massively more complex than network management for a wired network, because they have to manage around all the inherent difficulties that say you really shouldn\u2019t be able to do this in the first place. Physics is working against you, and they\u2019re measuring network activity in milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So the management of a wireless network is much more complex and active than the management of a wired network. That also gives it greater efficiencies in using [the spectrum] it\u2019s got. However, I think both have to be opened. You know, if wireless is now carrying 50, 60 percent of all the internet access, how could it possibly not be open?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s the device question, too. We don\u2019t have easily moveable handsets on carriers in the US. I can\u2019t just buy an AT&amp;amp;T phone, stick a Verizon SIM card in it and walk away. Do you think there\u2019s a way to get to a place where there\u2019s easier switching between carriers?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Well the problem we had in 3G was that we had two standards. Then you got 4G, which kind of evolved through multiple standards. You can port pretty well with LTE right now. And with 5G I think it\u2019s going be a question of what the standards are going to be again. I don\u2019t know.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But what\u2019s promising about 5G is that this summer we\u2019re gonna open up the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Europeans are bound and determined to have a standards process that replicates what created 3G to create 5G, and they want us to participate. And my response to them is that I don\u2019t participate in industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"Nobody said the marketplace is not without pain.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What we\u2019re going to do is make spectrum available faster than anybody in the world. This summer we\u2019re going to hash out some of the rules for 5G spectrum. And then we\u2019re going to get out of the way and we\u2019re going to say to our carriers, \"Go, use it, do whatever you want with it!\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what got us to leadership in 4G, and I think that\u2019s what will give us leadership in 5G.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Let me give you the obvious pushback. That got us to leadership in 4G, but it left Sprint basically cratered because they invested heavily in WiMax, which blew up in their face. Is there a place where you\u2019d come in and have a standards-setting process or no?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So now you\u2019re an acolyte of industrial policy then? [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, I\u2019m just asking the questions! But it\u2019s true, right? Sprint made a billion-dollar wrong bet and they\u2019ve never recovered from it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I mean, yes. Nobody said the marketplace is not without pain.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve talked a lot about the big fights you have on your docket now: cable box unlocking, privacy, making sure Title II stays alive. Are there any other dragons you want to slay?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;aside class=\"float-left\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"We\u2019re gonna run through the tape.\"&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, we\u2019re gonna reform the lifeline program so that low-income Americans have access to 21st century networks. We\u2019re going to address the provision of broadband data services by monopoly carriers. You know, the so-called special access issue. We\u2019re gonna run through the tape here, Nilay.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you\u2019re going fast, you\u2019ve got a lot of projects. But obviously you\u2019re going to have a successor. What sort of advice do you give your successor, especially in the context of the these big industries and their lobbying? What advice do you have about keeping the office independent and being pro-consumer?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know how I can tell my successor anything other than to use his or her best judgement. But I can tell you that one of the things that has been very helpful to me is my experience as a lobbyist.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s kind of spooky sitting in this office as I\u2019m speaking to you right now, because I used to come in here on my knees begging for things, saying that unless the Chairman did it my way, it would be the end of Western Civilization as we know it. [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m wondering if I can tell you this story \u2014&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You have to now!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Early on, literally my first week on the job, I brought all of the representative organizations together in a series of meetings. And I began \u2014 and this is something that is really high on my priority list \u2014 with all the representatives of disabilities groups.I said you are never going to have an FCC Chairman that is more in your corner and wants to do more to make sure we harness the technology of the 21st century to address the challenges of individuals with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;aside class=\"float-right\"&gt;&lt;q&gt;\"Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\" &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I had them at the first meeting because I wanted that to be symbolic and to send a message. But when we got to the various industry groups I said to them, \"You know, I\u2019ve sat in your shoes and I know the challenges of your job.\" I said my favorite movie is &lt;em&gt;Patton,&lt;/em&gt; and and there\u2019s a scene where Patton is having his first battle with Rommel in North Africa, and he had just finished reading Rommel\u2019s book on tank tactics. He\u2019s looking down on the valley and he sees the fight going on and he sees that he\u2019s winning. And George C. Scott says \"Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And I said to these guys, hey, you know, I may not have written the book about how to lobby, but I\u2019ve read it and maybe I even contributed a chapter or two. I used to be the one dishing it out. I understand the realities. I understand how they argue things. I understand what you have to do to hold an industry coalition together. I understand the challenge of their job. I respect the challenge of their job. And I think I\u2019m somewhat inoculated to the effects as a result of it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So real talk: do you think it\u2019s a requirement to have been a lobbyist to be an effective regulator?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, no, no. I\u2019m just telling you my personal experience. And I am not the guy to reflect on who it would be next year. You know, here\u2019s what I will tell this person, whoever he or she is: it\u2019s a fabulous time to be in this job. This is a time where the digital world is redefining everything else in the world, and we get to sit here right in the middle of it. And, yes, we get to deal with really tough, really complex issues. My goodness, what a blessing, what a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;center&gt;  &lt;figure class=\"e-image\"&gt;\n        &lt;img alt=\"Wheeler section break\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9HWOJEO-7qAz1FYGYERW-f7iaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6164015/vrg_0969_wheeler_text_break_02.0.png\"&gt;\n  &lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/center&gt; &lt;em&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;chorus-ad data-ad-slot=\"athena_features\"&gt;&lt;/chorus-ad&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: Comcast\u2019s NBC Universal division is a minority investor in The Verge\u2019s parent company, Vox Media.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/em&gt; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Photo of Tom Wheeler by David Ramos/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Design by &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/Happicamp\"&gt;James Bareham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Edited by &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/users/mvzelenko\"&gt;Michael Zelenko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3840404/theverge-footnote-style.0.css\"&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3840400/theverge-footnote-script.0.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;!--\r\nvar width = $(window).width();\r\n$(window).resize(function(){\r\n   if($(this).width() != width){\r\n      width = $(this).width();\r\n      if(width &lt; 600) {\r\n        $(\"span.dropcap\").removeAttr(\"class\");\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n});\r\n// --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n</content>\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/9/11181450/fcc-chairman-tom-wheeler-interview-5g-internet-net-neutrality\"/>\n    <id>http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/9/11181450/fcc-chairman-tom-wheeler-interview-5g-internet-net-neutrality</id>\n    <author>\n      <name>Nilay Patel</name>\n    </author>\n  </entry>\n</feed>\n",
