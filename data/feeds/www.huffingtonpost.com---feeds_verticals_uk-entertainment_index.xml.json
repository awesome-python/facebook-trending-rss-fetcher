Fay would like nothing more than to annoy me by playing the 1992 <em>Take That and Party </em>album at full blast, over and over... and over again! Her wall was plastered from top to bottom in Take That pictures, with Mark Owen closest to her bed. I was fairly indifferent to their music at that age and didn't know what all the fuss was about, but a year later they announced they were coming to Hylands Park to play 'Chelmsford Spectacular' and this was BIG Essex news! It was just down the road from our family home, and thousands of tickets sold out in minutes. I started paying more attention now, as Take That had been catapulted to massive fame, and they were coming to entertain almost every teenage girl in Essex! Little did I know I was to play that very same site many years later myself.<br />\n<br />\nMy sister was lucky enough to get tickets after a very tense morning of queuing and was allowed to go accompanied by my Uncle John. She was beside herself at the concert, spending the whole evening on my Uncle's shoulders, screaming at the top of her lungs to every word of every song. She bought all the merchandise home she could get her hands on, including her teenage pride and joy - a full size Take That flag that she managed to find a space for amongst all the other band paraphernalia in her bedroom. I have many memories of Fay sitting for hours listening to <em>Pray</em> in her CD Walkman over and over again dreaming of marrying Mark Owen. It was hard not to be impressed by my sister's dedication to this band and I MAY have even learnt and performed the 'Pray' dance routine from the video to impress her mates!<br />\n<br />\nFast forward 15 years and I had decided that working in a call centre couldn't be all that life had to offer me. I had decided to audition for the <em>X Factor</em> (again, this time hopefully with more luck)! I rehearsed two songs; Take That's <em>Up All Night</em> and Stevie Wonder's <em>Superstition</em>. It was the latter that managed to get me through the first round in front of the <em>XF</em> judges.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I came to release my debut album in November 2010, I was up against Take That's massive <em>Progress</em> album that had come out a few weeks earlier. This was the biggest album of the year, and it was hard to believe I was even in a chart battle with the biggest band of the moment. They pipped me to the No.1 post. It's my only album not to go to No.1 - so cheers guys!!<br />\n<br />\nTake That's Progress Live tour at Wembley Arena is still one of the best shows I have ever seen. The production was incredible, and the atmosphere was electric. It made a huge impression on me as an entertainer, as I was in the infancy of my own music career, and I watched on in awe of them entertaining the packed stadium of screaming fans.<br />\n<br />\nIt's been a real career highlight to get to know all the guys.<br />\n<br />\nI was to work professionally with Gary several times. Firstly when he was a judge on <em>XF</em> and I was co-presenting Xtra Factor in 2011 and 2012. I also had a the pleasure of performing <em>Shine</em> with Gary at the Royal Albert Hall for his Prince's Trust gig. And then finally as his guest judge for <em>XF</em> judge's houses in New York, 2013. I also toured the UK as special guest to Robbie in 2013 which was great fun.<br />\n<br />\nTake That have been a band for nearly three decades. What they have achieved over those years is an inspiration to me. So to be asked to support Take That at <strong>Barclaycard presents British Summer Time Hyde Park</strong> in July this year was a dream come true.

They've been there for days.<br />\n<br />\nIn the office next door, a grown man weeps the loss of his idol, one of the recent celebrity deaths that made millions mourn: whenever they left, they would have gone too soon.<br />\n<br />\nA friend is so obsessed with the band Queen that she owns their entire back catalogue, visits far-flung hotels on the proviso Freddie Mercury stayed there once, and recently made the ultimate commitment: a tattoo. She's 33. <br />\n<br />\nTeenagers teeter on the edge of sanity, admittedly - but what about the rest of us? Why don't we drop the act at 13? What emotional bonds are formed in those precious years that survive overtime, shopping lists, mortgage repayment plans?<br />\n<br />\nAnd how do our relationships with celebrities affect our 'real life' relationships?<br />\n<br />\nCelebrities are constructed, not born. Seen through a screen, they take on an irresistible hue. Cameras flash, a flicker of filtered photos; their lensed gaze locks onto yours and before you know it, you're smitten.<br />\n<br />\nBeing a fan is a form of parasocial interaction - a one-sided relationship, where we act as if it were reciprocal (much like my relationship with Tom Hardy). This is only exascerbated by the apparent accessibility of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/marie-maurer/its-time-to-get-real_b_8472202.html\" target=\"_hplink\">social media stars</a> - being able to tweet them, or comment on their videos (and, occasionally, get a response) conjures the illusion of connection.<br />\n<br />\nResearch by the American Psychological Association shows that people engage in parasocial relationships because they 'negate the chance of rejection' - a risk in any real world relationship. The lack of interaction is a relief: fans are free to imagine... well, anything, really.<br />\n<br />\nA win win, right? According to <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2012/10/is-being-a-fan-psychologically-unhealthy.html\" target=\"_hplink\">Dr Drew Ramsey</a>, Columbia professor of psychiatry:<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\"Fandom is reasonably unsatisfying. It doesn't return something specific to the individual.\"<br />\n</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nIn other words, a one-sided relationship can only get you so far. Except for some people, it goes too far. This becomes especially apparent when fans endure the loss of their idol. Leading psychologist Alan Hilfer told the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/08/why-some-grieve-dead-celebrities.html\" target=\"_hplink\">New York Times Magazine</a>:<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\"There are some people whose reactions to celebrity deaths are so obsessional and extreme that it can literally make them sick.\"\u00a0<br />\n</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nWhatever onlookers might think - <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mourning-prince-why-we-grieve-celebrity-deaths-grief_us_57190ba4e4b0d4d3f722974a\" target=\"_hplink\">the grief is real</a>.<br />\n<br />\nGiven this, it is perhaps surprising that the reason we become fans is often nothing to do with the celebrity in question. It's a 'tag' - part of our identity, something we can use to build (real) relationships: a conversation starter, a passport to a new community. These tightly-bound groups (just witness the '<a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/one-direction-directioners-channel-4-crazy-about-documentary\" target=\"_hplink\">army</a>' of One Direction superfans) can provide an invaluable support network.<br />\n<br />\nIn fact, being a fan does not always require a celebrity at all. Our own social networks are dominated by parasocial relationships: intimacy, but at a distance. We see our friends' lives through the same filters that were once the preserve of the famous. With the rise of online dating, we even view potential partners through this lens.<br />\n<br />\nWhen we form relationships with images, reality can only pale in comparison. Ok, we know these images aren't 'real'. We understand, rationally, the transiency and artificiality of celebrity. But that doesn't make us immune.<br />\n<br />\nCelebrities need fans: they're essential to their survival. If Zoella takes a selfie in the middle of a forest and there's no WiFi connection, does she still exist?<br />\n<br />\nIt's natural to admire; human to adore. Just make sure it's worth the investment. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3889772/images/s-ANONYMITY-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/clive-botting/our-kind-of-traitor-review_b_9846522.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Film Review: Our Kind of Traitor - Mustang - Green Room - The Seventh Fire]]></title>\n      <author>Clive Botting</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/clive-botting/our-kind-of-traitor-review_b_9846522.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment&amp;ir=UK+Entertainment</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 11:36:16 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA['Our Kind of Traitor', Susanna White's adaptation of the John Le Carre novel is an accomplished but predictable thriller - 'Mustang,' Deniz Camze Erguvan's impressive and powerful debut  feature is a gripping and haunting tale of family honour and the desire for individual freedom - Jeremy Saulnier's 'Green Room' has touches of black humour and a mounting body count - 'The Seventh Fire' documents the lives of two native Americans with fading dreams of a future with hope. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-05-1462449178-6070065-our_kind_of_traitor_jpg.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-05-1462449178-6070065-our_kind_of_traitor_jpg.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-05-1462449178-6070065-our_kind_of_traitor_jpg-thumb.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"570\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nDirector: Susanna White.

Dima launders money for the Russian Vory mafia and a Russian mobster known as The Prince (Grigoriy Dobrygin) is cleaning out the old guard. Diva wants out and the key's an information trade on a USB stick that'll tempt London - Kremlin links, dirty money traded through the City of London and Russian mafia links to an influential British MP. Diva wants Perry to deliver to MI6 in London and cautious, out of his depth, Perry's tempted. London's interest is reserved and MI6 agent Hector (Damian Lewis), with his own personal agenda, goes out on a limb to expose Aubrey Longrigg (Jeremy Northam), an influential British MP and the enemy within. <br />\n<br />\nAdapted from John Le Carre's novel by Hossein Amini, beautifully shot by Antony Dod Mantle and sharply edited ,'Our Kind of Traitor' is an accomplished but predictable thriller and a long way from the world of George Smiley.

Their over protective uncle Erol (Ayberk Pekcan) and grandmother (Nihal Koldas) must ensure that family honour and tradition prevail. The girls refuse to repent and become prisoners in their own home with sombre dress enforced, cookery lessons replace school work and arranged marriages beckon. <br />\n<br />\nWhen 'everything turns to shit,' it becomes 10-year-old Lale's (Gunes Sensoy) story as she observes and maps out her own path to independence as with a collective strength and courage Lale and her sisters fight tradition and repression in a traditional culture that sees young girls married off with little, if any say in their own future.  <br />\n<br />\nBeautifully shot with a superb script co-written with Alice Winocour and terrific natural performances, 'Mustang' is a gripping and haunting tale of the desire for freedom.

The Wild is unlike any other pop-up book I've seen before, structured to resemble a forest bear devouring a fish, <a href=\"http://simon-arizpe.squarespace.com/the-wild\" target=\"_hplink\">The Wild</a> then reveals a tale as you play with it. Triggering ones imagination, unleashing that which is so often lost among adults, an explosion of childlike wonder.<br />\n<br />\nThe Wild is above all charming, igniting a feeling of incandescent reverie, and its decorative colours, bright and cheerful, catch the eye. I was reminded, slightly, of Norse and Slavic folklore, with Simon's focus specifically on the natural world and the animal kingdom. It's hard not to smile when you look at the intricacy and sheer exuberance of his work.<br />\n<br />\n<center><br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-11-1462982767-3990643-the_wild.jpeg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-11-1462982767-3990643-the_wild.jpeg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-11-1462982767-3990643-the_wild-thumb.jpeg\" width=\"570\" height=\"427\" /></a></center><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDescribed as dangerous flexagons, this six sided hexi-flexigon is a mathematically precise construction, its forms and shapes hold an Aristotelian mixed with Pythagorean aesthetic, the most natural and most beautiful. I asked Simon about this mix of mathematics and the natural world that so enthralls him, he said <em>\"It's something I'm drawn to because I believe everybody can look at the natural world and if you're not reminiscing with it, you can break it down to it's smaller parts, so for example you can take a tree, break it down to it's leaves, then examine it's utilitarian form, creating something unique from that.\"</em><br />\n<br />\n<center><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-11-1462982813-6388339-the_wild4.jpeg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-11-1462982813-6388339-the_wild4.jpeg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-11-1462982813-6388339-the_wild4-thumb.jpeg\" width=\"570\" height=\"379\" /></a></center><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI have long had a particular aversion to utilitarianism, yet when it is combined with and inspired by something that is innately beautiful, nature being a prime example, there produces an absolute, atavistic connection. Something which cannot be broken. The late illustrator Charlie Harper, whose works such as The Golden Book of Biology, fused together a modernist artistic approach, with a utilitarian sensibility marked him out as an unusual character in his field. It's Harper's illustrations that proved a major influence on Simon when creating The Wild <em>\"Charlie Harper is a pretty big influence on me\"</em> he says<em> \"just because he really takes anything and everything, every biome, every animal etc, and tries to separate them into what they're doing, drawing from their natural ways.\"</em><br />\n<br />\n<center><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-11-1462982871-527299-the_wild3.jpeg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-11-1462982871-527299-the_wild3.jpeg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-11-1462982871-527299-the_wild3-thumb.jpeg\" width=\"570\" height=\"427\" /></a></center><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWith The Wild being, in itself, a miniature world that reveals a narrative, stylistically, Simon had to think hard in how to keep the balance between his rich mathematical style and the story. <em>\"Stylistically it's complicated, because when you just hand it to someone, cold turkey, they don't really know what they're looking at, as it's not exactly a book, it's this sphere that they have to just start playing with if they really want to understand, so I wanted to make it as approachable as I could, reducing the subject matter into its simplest forms, so what is the simplest thing you can do to create a bear and still have people easily understand what they're looking at. How simple can you go and still get people to have some emotion and empathy for these animals. It sounds silly, but you know something with eyes that you can kind of look at and then say well I feel something for that bear, that fish, because it's presented in a specific way.\"<br />\n</em><br />\nI must admit, I had never looked at this arena of paper craft with any degree of interest before, yet after my conversation with Simon, I was able to see the colossal degree of creativity, skill and scientific knowledge that goes into even the simplest design. Paper craft is an art form that requires varying degrees of viewing the world, in order to create that very endearing sense of magic.  <br />\n<br />\nImages courtesy of Simon Arizpe <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3337804/images/s-DEFAULT-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/gabrielle-taylor/music-the-greatest-gift-_b_9924954.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Music: The Greatest Gift to My Dad With MS]]></title>\n      <author>Gabrielle Taylor</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/gabrielle-taylor/music-the-greatest-gift-_b_9924954.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment&amp;ir=UK+Entertainment</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 11:06:36 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[My dad has a really bloody awful disease called Multiple Sclerosis (MS). He's 66 and has had it for 32 years of his life and when he's not in hospital, he lives in a nursing home with a body that has pretty much given up on him. It's the most horrific, unfair thing to happen to anyone; but particularly to a kind, intelligent man who never, ever, complains.<br />\n<br />\nMy dad also has an ENORMOUS record collection that he's gathered over 20 years. He was a total music buff and was so obsessed with his vinyl that the entire collection was part of an alphabetised filing system that was painstakingly hand written and recorded in a reference folder. We're talking over 300 records - from Michael Jackson to Talking Heads; and Prince to Led Zepplin. Since my mum passed away we've been slowly clearing out our family home and one thing that's always played on my mind is his record collection. They were such a huge part of his life that throwing or selling them didn't seem like an option.<br />\n<br />\nI started to research music and memory and came across some incredible pieces of research about the effect music can have on people with conditions like dementia. One of the areas that my dad's MS has attacked is his short term memory and cognitive ability which can make it hard to communicate with him. If music can seemingly tap in to a part of the brain that is unaffected by a disease like dementia, I wondered whether it would have any impact on my dad?<br />\n<br />\nSo I bought a portable record player and embarked on a bit of a project to take a bunch of his records from the old family home to his nursing home, every time I visited.<br />\n<br />\nThe first time I set it up he looked suspicious and asked me several times what I was doing as he kept forgetting. But I chose my first record well. He's a massive Rolling Stones fan so I wasn't surprised when his finger started tapping and he mouthed all the words to Sticky Fingers. He couldn't remember what he'd had for lunch but he knew every song, what year it was released and told me a story about going to see them in 1982. Whilst I knew he'd enjoy it, I didn't account for the fact we would spend the next few hours chatting more than we have in the last few years.<br />\n<br />\nWe had a lengthy debate about the best album ever made and he told me about the complicated history of Fleetwood Mac. He also told me that when he first met my mum he was a rocker and she was a Motown girl; he never convinced her about rock music but he grew to love soul just as much as her. We were about four hours into the first chapter of our musical voyage when Ben.E.King's iconic Stand By Me started to play. I looked over at him when these lyrics came on:<br />\n<br />\nIf the sky that we look upon<br />\nShould tumble and fall<br />\nOr the mountain should crumble to the sea<br />\nI won't cry, I won't cry<br />\nNo, I won't shed a tear<br />\nJust as long as you stand, stand by me<br />\n<br />\nHe looked tearful, as he often does when a song reminds him of my mum, but then he just smiled. And that's when I realised that the best gift you can give someone who is trapped by their own body, is music. Because music isn't just music when you can't get out of bed. It's a time machine to another place - a gateway to locked away emotions. And now, every Saturday afternoon we're not in a nursing home in Leeds, we're time travellers. Stopping off at a Bowie gig, or nodding along to Grace Jones at a cool party, or dancing in a 'discoth\u00e8que' with my mum to The Supremes.<br />\n<br />\nMusic seeps into our subconscious and is the soundtrack to our lives. An opening note can take people back 70 years and a lyric can make people fall in love again. It's there at the best and worst moments of your life. The most exciting and the most mundane. My dad may not remember that I've got a new job, or be able to help me put up my blinds in my new flat, but he can teach me about a life well lived through his much loved record collection. <br />\n<br />\nThe records were never meant to be played in a nursing home because he can't get out of bed. But they were meant to be played. And played they will be. And maybe one day my kids will put on Florence's Dog Days and I'll tell them how it got me round the London marathon; or Beyonce's Crazy In Love and I'll lecture them on why it's the best pop song ever made; or Stevie Wonder's As, and I'll tell them to <em>really</em> listen to the lyrics and they'll realise it's the best love song ever written.<br />\n<br />\nSo whilst you're inadvertently creating your own soundtrack to your life, why not ask your parents/ grandparents / hell, anyone you love, what their eight desert island discs would be and why. They might just surprise you. And I promise that the twinkle in their eye will be worth it. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3629510/images/s-VINYL-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/05/12/zac-efron-bad-neighbours-2_n_9929670.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Zac Efron Workout: How To Get A Body Like The 'Baywatch' And 'Bad Neighbours 2' Star]]></title>\n      <author>Caroline Frost</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/05/12/zac-efron-bad-neighbours-2_n_9929670.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-entertainment&amp;ir=UK+Entertainment</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:08:40 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's been a long time since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Musical_(franchise)\" target=\"_blank\">'High School Musical'</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Efron\" target=\"_blank\">Zac Efron</a> seems to have spent a fair proportion of that time in the gym, judging by these pictures.</p><br />\n<p>Zac buffed up even more than usual for his latest film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbors_2:_Sorority_Rising\" target=\"_blank\">'Bad Neighbours 2'</a>, and you can see the results here. But how has he pulled off this newly defined physique, and can you do the same? Here are some top tips...&nbsp;</p><br />\n<br />\n<p><strong>Get Ready to Grab the Big Weights </strong></p><br />\n<p>Zac&rsquo;s upper body is proof that curls are a good exercise to work on the biceps (of course). Hold each dumbbell at the side of the lower torso while slowly curling each one up to your chest area (elbows bending accordingly). Again, go for 4 sets of 10 x pull ups.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p><strong>Cardio-friendly workouts </strong></p><br />\n<p>Cardio is not only a great warm up but also very important when it comes to complete exercise routines. You can opt for a light jog or even some intense interval sprints (30 seconds on (sprints), 10 seconds rest and repeat for 10 minutes). This can be varied and something you can do in or out of the gym. We often see Zac jogging on the sunny streets of LA, so maybe something to try once the weather picks up again.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p><strong>Bodyweight training is important </strong></p><br />\n<p>It&rsquo;s always good to vary your work outs with some body weight training. You can do this at home, in the park, in the gym&hellip; or on a sandy beach somewhere like Zac. Pull-ups are a good place to start. They&rsquo;ll work various areas including your pictorials, deltoids, external oblique, plus more. Grip a bar above you with your arms facing outwards from your ears at 90 degree angles and slowly pull yourself towards the bar. Go for 4 sets of 10 x pull ups.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p><strong>Tyre Flipping</strong></p><br />\n<p>Tyre flipping is a great body building exercise and one that will also help with strength building and Zac seems to do this for fun after a day of filming with his co-host Dwayne &lsquo;The Rock&rsquo; Johnson. But this is certainly one to practise if you want to work on that strength and physique. You can get your hands on a tyre, whether it be an old car tyre or you can purchase one specifically for this purpose and it&rsquo;s something you can do easily in a garden space. Attempt this with the biggest tyre you can physically flip over and go from one end to the other (in an outdoor space) &ndash; doing as many a possible flips.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p><strong>Made in the Kitchen </strong></p><br />\n<p>They say abs are made in the kitchen but so is everything else. The hardest thing when it comes to getting ripped may just be living by a strict diet. Getting a body like Zac&rsquo;s will involve eating a ton of protein, loads of veg and swapping those processed foods for more simplistic alternatives. You might want to think about dropping white carbs although it may be hard to resist a nice portion of chips.</p><br />\n<p><em>Zac Efron stars in 'Bad Neighbours 2', now in UK cinemas.

That this is the first move in a long game by the Umbers to betray the Boltons and return power to the Starks, what they&rsquo;re calling &lsquo;The Northern Conspiracy&rsquo;, the alliance of all of the northern houses behind young Rickon. &nbsp;</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;The &lsquo;Great Northern Conspiracy&rsquo; points to a pro-Stark uprising, biding its time following the betrayal of the Red Wedding and Ned&rsquo;s execution. The soldiers of this sleeping army have, so the theory goes, been embedded with other rivals for the Throne, but really they lie in wait.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p2\">Advocates of all this point to Bran Stark&rsquo;s reappearance, and cross fingers he&rsquo;ll inspire a fresh uprising against the Lannisters. They&rsquo;re also wondering about the true identify of his sidekick Walder.&nbsp;And others are relying on Arya to come good, with or without the continuing support of the much-missed Jaqen H&rsquo;ghar.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Supporters of this conspiracy refer any doubters to the ultimate source, George RR Martin&rsquo;s novels, which highlight the Umbers' deeply embedded connections to the Starks, which viewers first saw back in Season 1.&nbsp;</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">They also point out the looming presence of the Manderlys, another family who appeared to betray the Starks but have more recently been uncovered as remaining loyal. And, just as with the Umbers, The Boltons are convinced they&rsquo;ve properly turned.&nbsp;</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, this could all be wishful thinking. Next week could see that Rickon&rsquo;s actually had his chips, with ever more power going to the Boltons. But nobody wants to see the Starks go down without a fight.&nbsp;</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/game-of-thrones-fan-theories_uk_571a0b45e4b0727e4fe76cca\">More 'Game of Thrones' fans' theories here...&nbsp;</a></p><br />\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>Click the first picture below to open the slideshow:</em></p><br />\n<br />\n <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/573475df2200005707256641.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
