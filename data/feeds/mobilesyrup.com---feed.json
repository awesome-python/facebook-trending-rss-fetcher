While the ad is a bold move, the Text and Drive letters are massive and drivers passing by might not see the small print of the funeral home&#8217;s business name, giving the PSA a rather morbid tone.</p><p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re here, you&#8217;ve probably seen our &#8220;Text and Drive&#8221; billboard. And if you have, you probably came to this website to tell us what horrible people we are for running an ad like that. And you&#8217;d be right,&#8221; said a statement on its website.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just trying to get Canadians to stop texting and driving, which is projected to kill more people in Ontario this year than drinking and driving. That&#8217;s right. More. And while most people wouldn&#8217;t even think about drinking and driving, over half of Ontario drivers admit to reading texts while behind the wheel. That&#8217;s more than half of the drivers on the road today risking their lives, their passengers\u2019 lives and the lives of their fellow motorists and pedestrians. Which should make you even madder than our billboard did.&#8221;</p><p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_k4Phy4IywQ?rel=0&amp;controls=0\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>The Government of Ontario banned the use of a mobile device while driving in 2009.

By shortening the approval time, the store is taking a step towards building more app developer loyalty and accelerating its app revenue stream.</p><p>This change would seem to be part of Apple&#8217;s new focus on services, which have quickly become more important to the company as iPhone sales have fallen.

What the tablet is though, is a capable upgrade to the aging iPad Air 2, as well as a decent enterprise device, depending on what tasks you need to accomplish.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-7.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-172451 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-7.jpg\" alt=\"ipadpro-7\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></a></p><h3>Technical specs</h3><ul class=\"grey-block\"><li>iOS 9.3</li><li>9.7-inch Retina 2048\u00d71536 pixel resolution display, 264 pixels per inch (ppi)</li><li>2GB RAM</li><li>64-bit A9X processor w/ M9 motion co-processor</li><li>32GB WiFi, 128GB WiFi, 256GB WiFi and 32GB, 128GB and 256GB WiFi + Cell versions</li><li>4 speaker audio system (stereo)</li><li>12-megapixel iSight camera, F2.2 lens</li><li>4K video recording (3840 x 2160)</li><li>5-megalpixel FaceTime camera, 720p HD videos</li><li>Touch ID</li><li>Bluetooth 4.2</li><li>Dual microphones for calls, video recording and audio recording</li><li>Wi\u2011Fi (802.11a/b/g/n/ac) MIMO; dual channel (2.4GHz and 5GHz)</li><li>Nano SIM</li><li>Three-axis gyro, Accelerometer, Ambient light sensor</li><li>6.1mm thick</li><li>0.96 pounds for WiFi version, 0.96 pounds for WiFi + cellular connectivity</li><li>27.5 Whr battery, 10-hour battery life (cellular is 9-hour battery life)</li><li>Available in Silver, Gold, Space Grey and Rose Gold</li></ul><h3><strong>Probably not a laptop replacement</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></h3><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-172450 size-full\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-6.jpg\" alt=\"ipadpro-6\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></a></p><p>Editing simple Word documents, browsing the internet or creating a basic spreadsheet? Then the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, similar to its larger and more unwieldy 12.9-inch brother, is the perfect device for you. This is in part due to its more manageable size and Smart Keyboard/Apple Pencil compatibility. Microsoft&#8217;s support for iPad Pro-specific app when it comes to Office, is also an added bonus for those looking to work on basic enterprise activities.</p><p>For all other tasks, however, most people will likely find a standard laptop \u2013\u00a0or perhaps if their mind is set on a two-in-one hybrid, Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book, which utilize a full-fledged version of Windows 10 \u2013 to suit their needs better. For me, using an iPad Pro as my daily work device is nearly impossible given the nature of my job.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ipadprodemo-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-164768 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ipadprodemo-1.jpg\" alt=\"ipadprodemo-1\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></a></p><p>I often need a number of tabs open at one time and programs to run simultaneously. It&#8217;s worth noting that thanks to the power of iOS 9, the iPad is capable of basic multitasking, though having two apps open at once often isn&#8217;t enough for me.</p><p>I also frequently use Photoshop for resizing images and basic photography editing. While it\u2019s true there are a number of mobile photo editing iOS apps available, many\u00a0even from Adobe, I\u2019ve never found any of them as functional as the standard desktop version of Photoshop.</p><h3>Will it convince aging PC users to jump ship?</h3><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-172448 size-full\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-4.jpg\" alt=\"ipadpro-4\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></a></p><p>During the 9.7-inch Pro\u2019s reveal press conference at the company\u2019s Cupertino, California-based campus, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated there are nearly 600 million aging Windows PCs in the world that are more than five years old.</p><p>Cook\u00a0cited the 9.7-inch iPad Pro as the perfect device for those looking to upgrade to modern hardware. While an ambitious statement, most PC users switching to an iPad Pro will find Apple\u2019s mobile operating system limiting.</p><p>iOS is great at simplifying a number of basic tasks, but the operating system is far from a desktop replacement, whether the intention is to move from OS X, Windows 10, or even an earlier version of Windows, to using the iPad Pro. There\u2019s also a substantial price difference between the Pro and a mid-range regular Windows laptop, especially with the addition of the sold-separately Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-10.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-172454 size-full\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-10.jpg\" alt=\"ipadpro-10\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></a></p><p>With all that said though, while preparing to write this review, I handed the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to a number of older family members who currently use some form of older Windows-based computer. With little instruction, most were able to accomplish simple tasks like checking their email, browsing the web and taking notes with the Smart Cover. Despite my skepticism regarding Cook\u2019s bold claim, perhaps there is some truth to Apple&#8217;s ambitions.</p><p>Though, it is worth noting every person who tested out the 9.7-inch Pro felt that while the Apple Pencil made navigating the tablet\u2019s more accurate, the accessory wasn\u2019t necessary, stating that if they were to jump from their older Windows device to a Pro \u2013 and this is something some people said they&#8217;d consider \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019d purchase the stylus.</p><h3><strong>Hardware powerhouse</strong></h3><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadair-3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-172445 size-full\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadair-3.jpg\" alt=\"ipadair-3\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></a></p><p>So now that we\u2019ve covered the Pro\u2019s strengths as well as its weaknesses, let\u2019s delve into the actual tablet. It\u2019s taken Apple roughly a year and a half to launch a successor to the iPad Air 2, and during this period, the company has managed to fit most of the 12.9-inch Pro\u2019s upgrades into a smaller form factor (the 9.7-inch Pro features 2GB of RAM instead of 4GB), resulting in a worthy successor to one of the tech giant\u2019s most well-received 9.7-inch tablets.</p><p>Just like the 12.9-inch Pro, its smaller 9.7-inch brother features four impressive stereo speakers on the side of its base that produce excellent sound, making listening to podcasts or watching YouTube videos a great experience (I rarely hooked the Pro up to my UE Boom Bluetooth speaker). The Apple Pencil, while not as sensitive as Microsoft\u2019s Surface Stylus Digital Ink technology, is great for making simple sketches, taking notes and creating doodles. I\u2019ve also found the Apple Pencil useful for playing specific video games that require accuracy \u2014 like FTL and Clash of Clans, for example.</p><p>The 9.7-inch Pro\u2019s Smart Keyboard is efficient for inputting passwords and typing up quick notes, though its too small to be useful for extended periods of typing, and just like the 12.9-inch Pro, doesn&#8217;t balance well when being used on your lap. It\u2019s also strange so few third-party manufacturers have taken advantage of the iPad Pro line\u2019s magnetic Smart Connector.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-172447 size-full\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-2.jpg\" alt=\"ipadpro-2\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></a></p><p>The only notable change between the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and the 12.9 inch edition, beyond its smaller form factor, as well as processor and camera upgrades, is its True Tone technology, a feature many poked fun at during Apple\u2019s press conference that revealed the smaller pro and iPhone SE. In reality, True Tone actually makes a significant difference in display quality, though admittedly it\u2019s difficult to notice the difference at first. True Tone adapts to the ambient light in the environment, subtly adjusting its white balance. The screen also displays a wider colour gamut thanks to its anti-reflective coated glass.</p><p>Then there\u2019s the 9.7-inch Pro\u2019s excellent 12 megapixel camera with 4K video shooting capabilities, matching the photography capabilities of the iPhone 6s. Despite what some might think \u2013 as well as how ridiculous it seems at times \u2013 a lot of people take pictures with the iPad. Seriously, go to your city\u2019s local Zoo and I guarantee you\u2019ll see at least one person snapping photos of a lion with an iPad. At least with the 9.7-inch Pro, their images won\u2019t be horrendous.</p><h3><strong>9.7-inch iPad Pro vs. iPad Air 2</strong></h3><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-172446 size-full\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-1.jpg\" alt=\"ipadpro-1\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></a></p><p>So if the 9.7-inch iPad Pro isn\u2019t for Windows users looking to jump ship, or an alternative for those using OS X, then who is its target demographic? It\u2019s those looking to upgrade from the iPad Air 2, or an even earlier iPad release.</p><p>The iPad Pro 9.7-inch&#8217;s display features the same resolution as the iPad Air 2, though it does offer a brighter and less reflective surface, as well as\u00a0a wider colour gamut. The main improvement, however, is the inclusion of\u00a0the A9X processor in the Pro, a significant jump from the A8X chip featured in the aging iPad Air 2.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-172452 size-full\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ipadpro-8.jpg\" alt=\"ipadpro-8\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></a></p><p>Whether or not the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is for you will depend on a variety of factors and what you&#8217;re actually looking for\u00a0in a tablet.

While a small figure compared to the sale of some other consumer electronics, particularly smartphones, one million units sold is a clear indicator the device has a bright future. It&#8217;s worth pointing out, however, that this number likely doesn&#8217;t consist of concurrent users.</p><p>Still, given this is likely the result Oculus wanted to get out of the partnership, both companies are probably satisfied with the headset&#8217;s early sales numbers.</p><p>The Gear VR costs $139.99 in Canada, though Samsung has done a variety of promotions where\u00a0new <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/03/08/samsung-galaxy-s7-and-galaxy-s7-edge-review-an-act-of-refinement/\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy S7 owners</a> could get the headset for free.</p><p><strong>Related reading</strong>: <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/01/03/why-samsungs-gear-vr-is-important-to-the-future-of-virtual-reality/\" target=\"_blank\">Why Samsung\u2019s Gear VR is important to the future of virtual reality</a></p><div class='sources-block'><span class='source-label rcb'>Source</span><a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/5/11/11653534/oculus-says-one-million-people-used-gear-vrs-virtual-reality-headset-last-month\">Recode</a></div>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/12/over-1-million-people-used-samsungs-gear-vr-headset-in-april/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>5</slash:comments></item><item><title>Google&#8217;s Amazon Echo competitor is reportedly called &#8216;Chirp&#8217;</title><link>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/12/google-working-on-amazon-echo-competitor-chirp/</link><comments>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/12/google-working-on-amazon-echo-competitor-chirp/#comments</comments><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:30:58 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Patrick O'Rourke]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Accessories]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Amazon Echo]]></category><category><![CDATA[Chirp]]></category><category><![CDATA[google]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://mobilesyrup.com/?p=172525</guid><description><![CDATA[A new report stemming from Recode indicates that Google could be working on its own Amazon Echo-like standalone voice assistant called &#8216;Chirp.&#8217; According to speculation, the device will operate similarly...]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new report stemming from <em>Recode</em> indicates that Google could be working on its own Amazon Echo-like standalone voice assistant called &#8216;Chirp.&#8217;</p><p>According to speculation, the device will operate similarly to the <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/03/24/google-is-reportedly-working-on-an-amazing-echo-competitor/\">Echo</a>, only with significant search and Google voice recognition, possibly even with Gmail integration, allowing users to search through their email via voice. Visually it looks <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/01/google-onhub-field-test-shows-router-covers-6000-sqft-in-2-countries-canada/\">very similar to the company&#8217;s OnHub</a> router that was set to launch earlier this year.</p><p>Other than this small amount of information, not much is known about the Chirp yet. It&#8217;s expected that the device will, however, work with Nest products.</p><p>Unfortunately rumours indicate that we won&#8217;t be getting our first glimpse at this device during I/O next week. Instead, it seems like Google will be ready to discuss Chirp later this year.</p><p>While Amazon&#8217;s Echo isn&#8217;t officially available in Canada, there are ways for Canadians to get their hands on the device.

The largest revenue jump was driven by its mobile services, which saw an increase of\u00a0$27 million or 30.2 percent. The company&#8217;s internet services followed with $18.1 million, business solutions at $9 million and its Club ilico video service at $2.3 million.</p><p>Furthermore, the Quebec-based company claims a net increase of 17,800\u00a0total subscribers, which brings its subscriber base to approximately 786,400.</p><p>Videotron is a subsidiary of the Quebec-based media giant Quebecor. Quebecor experienced an overall increase in growth during the first quarter of 2016 and reported revenues of $975.4 million, an increase of $46.4 million (or 5 percent).</p><p>In a statement sent to <em>MobileSyrup\u00a0</em>Manon Brouillette, president and CEO of Videotron, claimed that Videotron&#8217;s high-growth-potential products can be credited with the growth.</p><p>&#8220;Videotron\u2019s high-growth-potential products and services, particularly mobile telephony, Internet access, business solutions and Club illico, contributed to its higher numbers again,\u201d said Brouillette.</p><p>While Videotron&#8217;s Club ilico service is only starting to generate significant revenue, the company is committed to further developing the service.</p><p>Brouillette went on to say that at the beginning of 2016\u00a0NBCUniversal Television &amp; New Media Distribution Canada and Quebecor\u00a0Content signed an agreement which will give Club illico members access to a wider variety of new releases and content.</p><p>In addition, Videotron&#8217;s average monthly revenue per user increased year over year $131.96 to\u00a0$141.37 (or approximately 7 percent).</p><p>Videotron isn&#8217;t doing poorly on the public opinion side of things either. In March, the company\u00a0was ranked the <a href=\"http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/videotron-is-quebecs-most-respected-telecommunications-company-for-eleventh-consecutive-year-572407571.html\">most respected telecommunications</a> company in Quebec for the eleventh year in a row.

Canadian-owned Sport Chek has opened a tech-focused flagship location on Robson Street in Vancouver.</p><p>While this seems small in scale, the technology powering the location is something that draws you in. In this store, Spork Check states the 53,000 square foot location features three floors of retail space that merge the concept of a brick and motor location with the latest in-store technology.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/sport-chek-expands-presence-in-greater-vancouver-with-new-flagship-store-578633271.html\" target=\"_blank\">The new store officially</a> opens this Thursday and will employ 265 people. This location was previously occupied by Chapters and embedded within the store is various tech, including 55-inch and 75-inch displays, and an LED ribbon to display customers sports scores and important news. In addition, honing on golf, Sport Chek has created a &#8220;Golf Virtual Department Kiosk&#8221; that recommends specific equipment based on your abilities.</p><p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-172056 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sportcheck-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"sportcheck\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" /></p><p>A &#8220;Sport Chek first&#8221; has been installed in this location as there are &#8220;motion activated screens&#8221; that give &#8220;real-time content based on movement.&#8221; For example, in the shoe department, there are large screen displays with interactive touch-screen video walls and a radio-frequency identification (RFID) that gives descriptions on specific footwear and its benefits.</p><p>There&#8217;s also a &#8220;Tech Shop&#8221; that has the latest in wearable tech from various manufacturers, such as Fitbit and GoPro. Probably the most intriguing is the inclusion of 3D holograms, which showcase various products.</p><p>&#8220;Building on the success of one of Sport Chek&#8217;s first flagship stores in Metrotown, Burnaby, we are excited to bring our second stadium of sport to the GVA,&#8221; said Chad McKinnon, chief operating officer at FGL Sports. &#8220;This store has been designed specifically for athletes in the community that share a passion for sport and activity, and are looking for the best products delivered in an immersive, inspiring environment.&#8221;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-172055\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sportcheck1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"sportcheck1\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" /></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-172053\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sportcheck4-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"sportcheck4\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" /></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-172052\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sportcheck5-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"sportcheck5\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" /></p><p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/oKETHEbfEMQ?rel=0&amp;controls=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/12/sport-cheks-new-vancouver-flagship-store-features-3d-product-holograms-and-motion-activated-screens/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>2</slash:comments></item><item><title>Radio association demands the Big Three give Canadians free FM radio on their phones [Update]</title><link>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/12/radio-association-demands-the-big-three-give-canadians-free-fm-radio-on-their-phones/</link><comments>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/12/radio-association-demands-the-big-three-give-canadians-free-fm-radio-on-their-phones/#comments</comments><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:44:43 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rose Behar]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Manufacturers]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[bell]]></category><category><![CDATA[rogers]]></category><category><![CDATA[telus]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://mobilesyrup.com/?p=172496</guid><description><![CDATA[Canada&#8217;s National Campus and Community Radio Station (NCRA) has launched a campaign to petition that Bell, Telus and Rogers &#8220;unlock&#8221; the use of the FM radio receiver on all applicable...]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada&#8217;s National Campus and Community Radio Station (NCRA) has launched a campaign to petition that Bell, Telus and Rogers &#8220;unlock&#8221; the use of the FM radio receiver on all applicable Canadian mobile phones.</p><p>The NCRA states it has support from the CBC network, and has partnered with US mobile radio app\u00a0<a href=\"http://nextradioapp.com\" target=\"_blank\">NextRadio</a>, which helped launch an identical campaign in the US several years ago. The ongoing American campaign, called <a href=\"http://freeradioonmyphone.org\" target=\"_blank\">Free Radio on My Phone</a>,\u00a0is also backed by radio organizations such as NPR and American Public Media.</p><p>In its <a href=\"http://ncra.ca/news/unlock-the-fm-chips-on-smart-phones\" target=\"_blank\">letter to members</a>, NCRA says its aim is to turn on an FM chip inside Canadian devices that would allow them to access the FM radio frequency without the use of cellular data. It states that FM chips are most often pre-installed in smartphones, and acknowledges that some devices (including certain <a href=\"http://support.sonymobile.com/global-en/xperiaz3/userguide/Listening-to-radio/\" target=\"_blank\">Sony</a> and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/blackberry-update-adds-fm-radio-because-why-not/\" target=\"_blank\">Blackberry</a> devices) already have the feature enabled. Its aim, however, is for all devices to have access regardless of carrier or OEM, and to achieve that goal the NCRA is asking the general public to write, call and petition the major telecoms and the CRTC.</p><p>&#8220;These organizations want to keep these chips disabled because they make money off of data use, whereas the FM chips don\u2019t require data,&#8221; says the letter, &#8220;The sector is interested in turning them on because it opens up more listening opportunities for people to hear FM radio.&#8221;</p><p>The NCRA and Free Radio on My Phone both note that aside from the obvious benefit of listening to free radio for entertainment, FM radio can also be the most reliable form of mass communication in emergency situations, such as the wildfires in Fort McMurray.</p><p>In what could be an encouraging sign for the Canadian campaign, its American counterpart has succeeded in making progress over the last few years. Those on the Sprint network in the US can now get free FM radio on all Android devices, and AT&amp;T and Blu are rolling out the addition as well. T-Mobile is reported to be following suit late this year or early 2017. Apple, which holds a large share of the overall smartphone market, is holding out on enabling the feature, however.</p><p><em>MobileSyrup</em> has reached out for comment to Bell, Telus and Rogers.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Rogers has replied with the following comment, stating that it is the OEMs that have the power to enable FM chips, not them.</p><p>&#8220;We\u2019re always looking to offer our customers new features on their devices. Enabling FM chips in our smartphone lineup requires the support of the device manufacturers and we\u2019re working with them on any plans they have for FM radio.&#8221;</p><p>Bell has also replied that the onus lies on OEMs.</p><p>&#8220;Bell offers a number of devices in our line-up that support FM radio, from Samsung, Sony, HTC, Blackberry and other manufacturers.

This is particularly true for those who live outside of North America, with Google reporting that more than 9 in 10 of the over 500 million people who use Google Translate live outside the US in places like India, Indonesia and Brazil.</p><p>In a blog post published today, Google says that it consulted with thousands of those international users in an effort to improve its Google Translate app with new features that will be rolling out over the next few days.</p><p>The largest announcement is &#8220;<a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2015/12/16/android-will-soon-have-system-wide-support-for-google-translate/\" target=\"_blank\">Tap to Translate</a>,&#8221; which we first got a glimpse of in December.

The government, however, has decided the argument lacked merit and that it will uphold the CRTC&#8217;s mandate.</p><p>&#8220;The CRTC&#8217;s decision to extend wholesale broadband regulation to fibre to the home means the CRTC has updated its regulatory approach to keep pace with changing technology and consumer demand,&#8221; said Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development in a <a href=\"http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1063779\" target=\"_blank\">statement.</a></p><p>&#8220;The decision strikes the right balance between the private sector having incentive to invest and consumers having a competitive choice.&#8221;</p><p>Bains added that, &#8220;Enabling competition in telecommunications is a government commitment, and we will continue to foster a strong investment environment for telecommunications services to keep Canada at the leading edge of the digital economy.&#8221;</p><p>While smaller ISPs seem to have won the battle on this front, they remain locked out of the <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/12/canadians-think-little-wireless-competition-mvnos/\" target=\"_blank\">wireless industry</a>.</p><p><strong>Related reading:</strong> <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/13/crtc-chairman-talks-privacy-carrier-competition-and-whats-next-for-canada/\" target=\"_blank\">CRTC Chairman talks privacy, carrier competition and what&#8217;s next for Canada</a></p><div class='sources-block'><span class='source-label rcb'>Source</span><a href=\"http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1063779\" target=\"_blank\">Government of Canada</a></div>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/government-rejects-bells-appeal-regarding-small-isps-access-fibre-optic-access/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>31</slash:comments></item><item><title>Apple granted patent for iPad cover with a second screen</title><link>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/apple-granted-patent-for-an-ipad-cover-with-a-second-screen/</link><comments>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/apple-granted-patent-for-an-ipad-cover-with-a-second-screen/#comments</comments><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 23:00:49 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Vomiero]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Accessories]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tablets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apple]]></category><category><![CDATA[cover]]></category><category><![CDATA[ipad]]></category><category><![CDATA[patent]]></category><category><![CDATA[screen]]></category><category><![CDATA[smart]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://mobilesyrup.com/?p=172292</guid><description><![CDATA[Apple&#8217;s iPad Smart Cover could soon get even smarter.

Furthermore, the design of the cover varies significantly, from a full fledged second display to a display that&#8217;s restricted to a section of the cover.</p><p>Although the patent was granted recently, it was actually filed in 2011, an some features from the original patent have already been realized while others remain a bit\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2016/05/apple-awarded-a-patent-for-a-next-gen-ipad-pro-cover-with-a-secondary-display-for-drawing-more.html\">too far fetched</a>.</p><p>Seeing as it&#8217;s only a patent, there&#8217;s no guarantee Apple will create a product that takes advantage of the features described within.</p><p><strong>Related reading</strong>: <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/03/21/apple-announces-9-7-inch-ipad-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple&#8217;s new tablet is a smaller iPad Pro</a></p><div class='sources-block'><span class='source-label rcb'>Source</span><a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=9335793&amp;OS=9335793&amp;RS=9335793\" target=\"_blank\">U.S Patent and Trademark Office</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/apple-granted-patent-for-an-ipad-cover-with-a-second-screen/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>8</slash:comments></item><item><title>YouTube creates messaging service, hoping you&#8217;ll never leave its app</title><link>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/youtube-creates-messaging-service-hoping-youll-never-its-app/</link><comments>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/youtube-creates-messaging-service-hoping-youll-never-its-app/#comments</comments><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 22:00:21 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Vomiero]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Games/Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[app]]></category><category><![CDATA[chat]]></category><category><![CDATA[facebook]]></category><category><![CDATA[messenger]]></category><category><![CDATA[share]]></category><category><![CDATA[youtube]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://mobilesyrup.com/?p=172365</guid><description><![CDATA[While the social media giants have expressed an interest in tackling video, it looks like the undisputed king of video is going after social.

YouTube reportedly hopes that this program will prompt users to share more videos with others.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/05/youtubes-new-messenger-means-youll-never-leave-youtube/\" target=\"_blank\">It\u2019s been suggested</a> that the attempts made recently by Facebook (and Instagram), Snapchat and Amazon to lure away YouTube\u2019s growing audience have influenced this new feature.</p><p>At Facebook\u2019s recent <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/12/facebooks-f8-developers-conference-brings-several-new-reveals/\" target=\"_blank\">F8 developer conference</a>, the company stressed that video was the way of the future. Noticeable changes have been made to Facebook\u2019s main interface, such as placing the <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/07/facebook-live-gains-its-own-mobile-home-adds-several-new-features/\" target=\"_blank\">LIVE tab</a>, Facebook\u2019s live video feature, up front and centre.</p><p>While <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/19/snapchats-updated-iphone-app-now-lets-you-add-moving-emojis-to-videos/\" target=\"_blank\">Snapchat has captured the millennial market</a> with a ten-second video model, Instagram has gone on to <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/03/29/you-can-now-post-60-second-videos-to-instagram/\" target=\"_blank\">lengthen its video feature </a>as well. However, what\u2019s probably the most oblivious attempt to poach YouTube subscribers came from Amazon earlier this week with the launch of <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/10/amazon-launches-video-service-to-potentially-compete-with-youtube/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Video Direct</a>.</p><p>Amazon Video Direct is a video service that plans to attract creators by paying them half the royalties earned from their videos. Just a few weeks ago, Amazon also<a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/18/amazon-launches-a-streaming-service-to-rival-netflix-probably-something-else-that-wont-come-to-canada/\" target=\"_blank\">launched a streaming service</a> that was projected to rival Netflix.</p><p>YouTube, however, still has a clear monopoly on user-generated video. According to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube\u2019s press page</a>, the average viewer\u00a0spends approximately 40 minutes on the app, and that statistic only applies to mobile. It appears that YouTube is also in little danger of losing creators, as the number of channels earning above six figures is up 50 percent year over year.</p><p>In theory, though competition is beginning to rear its ugly head, it would be almost impossible for emerging upload\u00a0services to make a dent in YouTube\u2019s over 1 billion active users. However, based on the Google-owned video company\u2019s actions as of late, that dent might be bigger than we thought.</p><p><strong>Related reading</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/10/amazon-launches-video-service-to-potentially-compete-with-youtube/\">Amazon launches video service to potentially compete with YouTube</a></p><div class=\"sources-block\"><span class=\"source-label rcb\">Source</span><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/05/youtubes-new-messenger-means-youll-never-leave-youtube/\">Wired</a></div>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/youtube-creates-messaging-service-hoping-youll-never-its-app/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>5</slash:comments></item><item><title>Montreal-made Hitman Go is now available on Gear VR and Oculus Rift headsets</title><link>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/montreal-made-hitman-go-arrives-on-virtual-reality-headsets-tomorrow/</link><comments>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/montreal-made-hitman-go-arrives-on-virtual-reality-headsets-tomorrow/#respond</comments><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 21:30:05 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Igor Bonifacic]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Games/Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[GearVR]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hitman GO]]></category><category><![CDATA[Oculus Rift]]></category><category><![CDATA[Square Enix Montreal]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://mobilesyrup.com/?p=172408</guid><description><![CDATA[Update: Square Enix Montreal has released its popular Hitman Go on both the Gear VR and Oculus Rift VR headsets.

Escape with this assassin strategy game.</p><hr /><p>Hitman Go, the excellent Square Enix Montreal developed spinoff of the\u00a0Hitman franchise, will come to Gear VR and Oculus Rift headsets tomorrow, reports <em>The Verge&#8217;s</em> Andrew Webster.</p><p>Released initially on iOS back in 2014, the turn-based strategy title will cost $7.99 USD on Gear VR and $9.99 USD (prices are converted to CAD from USD in the Oculus market place) on Oculus Rift when it arrives on those platforms. The latter version runs at 90 frames per second and takes advantage of the Rift&#8217;s head-tracking functionality.</p><p>The game is already available on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/hitman-go/id731645633?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareenixmontreal.hitmango&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>, as well as PC and PlayStation 4. We were huge fans of the game, and Square Enix Montreal&#8217;s subsequent title, <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2015/08/28/lara-croft-go-square-enix-montreal/\">Lara Croft Go</a>, when it originally came out.</p><p><strong>Related reading</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/01/02/game-of-the-year-square-enix-montreals-lara-croft-go-is-the-perfect-mobile-game/\">Best mobile game of 2015: Lara Croft Go is nearly perfect</a></p><div class='sources-block'><span class='source-label rcb'>Source</span><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/11/11656250/hitman-go-vr-oculus-rift-gear-vr\" target=\"_blank\">The Verge</a></div>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/montreal-made-hitman-go-arrives-on-virtual-reality-headsets-tomorrow/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>0</slash:comments></item><item><title>weBoost aims to increase awareness of signal boosting in Canada with the Eqo</title><link>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/weboost-aims-to-increase-awareness-of-signal-boosting-in-canada-with-the-eqo/</link><comments>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/weboost-aims-to-increase-awareness-of-signal-boosting-in-canada-with-the-eqo/#comments</comments><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 20:56:59 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rose Behar]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Accessories]]></category><category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category><category><![CDATA[Features]]></category><category><![CDATA[Latest]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[signal boosters]]></category><category><![CDATA[weboost]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://mobilesyrup.com/?p=170449</guid><description><![CDATA[The cellphone signal booster that led to weBoost&#8217;s foundation was born of necessity.

The devices have since done well enough that signal boosting has become Wilson Electronics&#8217; main area of business.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eqo-1-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-172389 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eqo-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"eqo-1\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1332\" /></a></p><p>A representative of the company, Taylor White, says weBoost&#8217;s success is tied to the fact that it stands by its products.</p><p>\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re known for is our warranty and customer service. Even years later, past the warranty date, we make sure we take care of our customers,\u201d says White, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not a gimmick, it costs money, so if you pay for it you want to make sure it works.\u201d</p><p>But while the solutions enjoy a reputation for integrity in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/weBoost/b/ref=bl_dp_s_web_10977830011?ie=UTF8&amp;node=10977830011&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=weBoost\" target=\"_blank\">online reviews</a>, they also commonly consist of bulky equipment accompanied by a challenging setup process. Among the online reviews, the instalment process, along with the price \u2013\u00a0which can range to $1,429.99 CAD for larger-scale <a href=\"https://store.weboost.ca/collections/boosters-home-office\" target=\"_blank\">consumer solutions</a>\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0are noted as the chief detractors.</p><p>White says those issues are the main reason weBoost decided to launch a different sort of product this year. The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/weBoost/b/ref=bl_dp_s_web_10977830011?ie=UTF8&amp;node=10977830011&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=weBoost\" target=\"_blank\">Eqo</a>, which debuted in North America last month online and at retail locations such as Best Buy, Canadian Tire and The Source, was designed to be simpler to use, better looking and less expensive than most of the \u00a0other products offered by the company.</p><p>Priced at $499 CAD, the Eqo comes in the form of two all-black boxes twice the size of most wifi routers. The devices are meant to provide a truly plug and play solution for an apartment or room-sized space of approximately 1,500 square feet of coverage.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eqo-2-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-172390 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eqo-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"eqo-2\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1332\" /></a></p><p>\u201cAll the other solutions are hardwired,\u201d explains White, \u201cBut this one is mobile. You can easily take it with you, if you\u2019re an RVer, or going on a vacation. And it works for everyone in the room, no matter what their carrier.\u201d</p><p>I put the Eqo\u2019s ease of assembly to the test with a late-night attempt that I honestly didn\u2019t expect to be successful. Less than five minutes later I had completed my task and was surprised to realize that I had only looked at two pages of instructions with five short steps.</p><p>The first step entails using your phone to test where the wireless signal is strongest. To do this with an Android device entails navigating from settings to \u201cabout phone,\u201d and then to signal strength and frequency. With an iPhone, using the Eqo requires the phone to enter test mode.</p><p>The signal strength is measured in dBm, or decibels above milliwatts. I used the downstairs of my house for the test, measuring every corner. The signal strength ranged from -107 to -100, where the lower number is the stronger signal.</p><p>That\u2019s not a particularly healthy signal range considering the phone I was using ran on the Bell network, which is the most extensive in Canada, and I live in the LTE-saturated Greater Toronto Area. A solid signal strength is considered in the range of -60 dBm.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eqo-3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-172391 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eqo-3.jpg\" alt=\"eqo-3\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1332\" /></a></p><p>Once I had found the location with the strongest signal strength, I plugged one of the boxes, the antenna, in to the wall outlet. Then I put the other box in the area of the downstairs with worst signal strength, an estimated 12 or 13 feet away. Though the instructions warn that one must position the two devices at least six feet away from each other, they must also be connected by a cable which restricts the distance between the two to a span of 25 feet. Besides that, it adds the logistical issue of where and how to hide the cord.</p><p>But though I was perturbed by the cable, I was immediately impressed by the results. In the location where I had set up the receiver box, the signal strength leapt from -107 to -76 dBms, a difference of 31 dBms total. When I played around with my phone I noticed a significant increase in speed. Not enough of a difference to make me shell out $500, and also nowhere near the full gain possible according to weBoost&#8217;s website, which reports the potential of a 70 dBm difference.</p><p>But the Eqo is not really designed for people with only moderately poor signal connections. It&#8217;s for those that have seriously unstable or nearly non-existent connections. In consideration of that, there are a few situations I can think of in which I would be very glad to have an Eqo.</p><p>In an urban location, it could be best used to amplify the signal of a less expensive carrier like Wind for a basement user and pay for itself in lower monthly bills. It could also be a solution for rural locations that don\u2019t require heavy duty antenna equipment \u2013 a small house or apartment in a rural hamlet or town, for instance.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eqoside.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-172402 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eqoside.jpg\" alt=\"eqoside\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" /></a></p><p>But even with compelling use cases, White notes that weBoost&#8217;s devices and signal boosters in general are not as well known in Canada as they are in the US, where they are more commonplace. Boosters have been employed in such high numbers in the US, in fact, that the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/rulemaking/10-4\">US created regulations</a> in 2013 to control the use of \u201crogue boosters,\u201d that caused issues with wireless infrastructure due to too high an output of power.</p><p>There is now a set of standards for output in place, and customers in the US must register their device with their carrier for better oversight. In Canada, however, signal boosters do not have to be registered with their user&#8217;s wireless carriers. At least, not yet.</p><p>White says weBoost is focused on bringing awareness of signal boosting to Canada, even launching a campaign called &#8220;Seize the bars.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The hardest thing for us is awareness,&#8221; said White. &#8220;Once people know we exist it\u2019s kind of a no-brainer.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Related reading:</strong> <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/01/19/to-keep-canadians-connected-carriers-are-going-small/\" target=\"_blank\">To keep Canadians connected, carriers are going &#8216;small&#8217;</a></p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/weboost-aims-to-increase-awareness-of-signal-boosting-in-canada-with-the-eqo/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>8</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>",
