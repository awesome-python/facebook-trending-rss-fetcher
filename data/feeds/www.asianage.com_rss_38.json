I have to prove they are innocent to prove my innocence,\u201d said Mr Michel in an interview to a TV news channel in Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Michel confirmed that in 2008 he did describe Mrs Gandhi in a letter as \u201cthe driving force\u201d behind the decision to acquire new helicopters for use by VVIPs when her party was in power.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He said that he did not personally know either Mrs Gandhi or Mr Rahul Gandhi, and stressed that his written suggestion that diplomats lobby with them did not mean that they had been bribed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He said that he stood by his earlier claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year had met with his Italian counterpart in New York, and offered to release the two Italian marines imprisoned in India on murder charges in exchange for information on the Agusta deal that could embarrass or implicate Mrs Gandhi.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Michel, in an interview to another channel, had said that he had never met Mrs Gandhi or former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to push for the purchase of the VVIP helicopters. \u201cNo, never,\u201d was his reply when he was asked whether he had ever met Mrs Gandhi, Mr Singh or former defence minister A.K. Antony for pushing the deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Michel is one of three alleged middlemen whom Indian investigating agencies suspect to have brokered the deal in favour of AgustaWestland.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Both CBI and ED have notified Mr Michel under the Interpol Red Corner Notice. \u201cI probably met him (former IAF chief S.P. Tyagi) at the Gymkhana Club and I think I shook his hand there. But because of his association with  Haschke (middleman Guido Haschke) I really avoided him,\u201d he claimed. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday continued his tirade against the Congress president.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Addressing election rallies in Kerala, Mr Shah, in an apparent reference to Mrs Gandhi\u2019s emotional speech during an earlier campaign speech in the state, which was seen as her reply to the opposition\u2019s taunt on her Italian origin, said that the Congress president should answer where her \u201cpatriotism\u201d was when corruption of Rs 12 lakh crore took place under the UPA regime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He also cited the AgustaWestland copter bribery case along with 2G, CWG and other alleged scams. The Congress is akin to corruption and scams and has no right to rule Kerala, he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/category/india\">India</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/source/age-correspondents\">AGE CORRESPONDENTS</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/place/new-delhi\">New Delhi</category>\n <enclosure url=\"http://www.asianage.com/image/view/494908/preview\" length=\"7737\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\n <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">494909 at http://www.asianage.com</guid>\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>Congress plans privilege motion on BJP \u2018lies\u2019</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.asianage.com/india/congress-plans-privilege-motion-bjp-lies-907</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;all-attached-images&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;width: 430px&quot; class=&quot;image-attach-body&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/jairam-ramesh-addresses-press-conference-agustawestland-scam-aicc-headquarters-new-delhi-photo-pti-9&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.asianage.com/sites/default/files/images/Jairam Ramesh_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jairam Ramesh addresses a press conference on AgustaWestland scam, at AICC Headquarters in New Delhi.

Swamy has made baseless allegations,\u201d Mr Ramesh said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSwamy has spoken big lies in the Rajya Sabha on May 4 and has used false documents.

(Photo: PTI)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promises to launch prohibition campaign in UP May 15 onwards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nJanata Dal (United) president and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday set the tone for the Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh by trying to position himself as a direct challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But launching his offensive in Varanasi, Mr Modi\u2019s constituency, the signal Mr Kumar wanted to send was loud and clear \u2014 that he could well be the face of an anti-BJP front in the next general elections.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Uttar Pradesh, often described as the \u201cgateway to Delhi\u201d, was Mr Kumar\u2019s obvious starting point. Mr Kumar, projected as Arjun from Mahabharata in posters that were plastered across the city (with Sharad Yadav as his saarthi, guide), made it clear that he would lead the campaign against the BJP in UP. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes, he is our Arjun and will demolish the army of Kauravas in the country,\u201d said JD(U) state president Suresh Niranjan Bhaiyya.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aware that with the JD(U)\u2019s negligible presence in the state, he would need the support of at least one major player to challenge the BJP in the Assembly polls scheduled next year, said that he respected Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He did, however, add that \u201cwhen we were fighting against the BJP in Bihar, he left us.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Kumar is looking at the possibility of a grand alliance of anti-BJP, secular parties for 2019, and the Congress, incidentally, is already on board. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from the fact that it is the Prime Minister\u2019s turf, Mr Kumar chose a workers\u2019 meeting in Varanasi because of its large Kurmi population. Mr Kumar, a Kurmi himself, intends to play the caste card to dismantle the BJP\u2019s OBC dream to the extent possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a significant aspect of Mr Kumar\u2019s workers\u2019 rally was the visibly large presence of women. Mr Kumar announced to thunderous applause that he would launch a campaign for prohibition in UP May 15 onwards. He said that he had banned liquor in Bihar on the specific demand of women.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Slamming the BJP for turning its back on promises made during the Lok Sabha elections, Mr Kumar said that he had come to UP to ask people to see through the BJP: \u201cVaranasi knows how arrogant the BJP leaders can be. The people of this city are aware of how they have been fooled. The entire country knows this, too. Bihar has given an apt reply to the BJP and it is the turn of Uttar Pradesh now.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTheir slogan says \u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\u2019 but their real story began from UP. First it was \u2018Love Jihad\u2019, then \u2018Ghar Wapsi\u2019 and then beef. Now they are talking of \u2018deshbhakti\u2019 though their ideological ancestors, the RSS, had nothing to do with the freedom struggle. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am glad that the BJP has finally started talking about the tricolour instead of their saffron flag and this is the victory of socialism\u201d, he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey said they would bring back black money stashed abroad within 100 days and each citizen would get around Rs 15 lakh. BJP president now says that this was just a jumla. They have taken people for a ride,\u201d he said. Targeting the rural belt, he said that the Modi government had promised that a 50 per cent profit would be ensured for farmers while announcing the minimum support price. \u201cHas anyone got it? Have the youth got the jobs they were promised\u201d he asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/category/india\">India</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/author/amita-verma\">Amita Verma</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/place/lucknow\">Lucknow</category>\n <enclosure url=\"http://www.asianage.com/image/view/494904/preview\" length=\"18477\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\n <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">494905 at http://www.asianage.com</guid>\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>Spicejet to pay Rs 10 lakh for offloading disabled: Supreme Court</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.asianage.com/india/spicejet-pay-rs-10-lakh-offloading-disabled-supreme-court-903</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;all-attached-images&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;width: 430px&quot; class=&quot;image-attach-body&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/bench-held-spicejet-acted-callous-manner-and-violated-civil-aviation-rules-photo-pti-902&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.asianage.com/sites/default/files/images/SpiceJet 45.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The bench held SpiceJet acted in a callous manner, and violated civil aviation rules.

(Photo: PTI)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court on Thursday awarded Rs 10 lakhs as damages to Jeeja Ghosh of Kolkata, a disabled passenger suffering from cerebral palsy who was offloaded by SpiceJet while travelling from Kolkata to Goa to attend a conference in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A bench of Justices A.K. Sikri and R.K. Agrawal, allowing Ms Ghosh\u2019s petition, said a little care, a little sensitivity and a little positive attitude on the part of SpiceJet officials would not have resulted in the trauma, pain and suffering Jeeja Ghosh suffered. This led to the violation of her human dignity and her fundamental rights, it said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The bench said Jeeja Ghosh herself was a living example who had, notwithstanding her disability, achieved so much by sheer determination. The bench held SpiceJet acted in a callous manner, and violated civil aviation rules. The bench directed the airline to pay Rs 10 lakhs in damages to her within two months. The bench asked the director-general of civil aviation to ensure all airports get the assistive equipment needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On flights, it said the cabin crew should assist passengers to access the toilet if requested using on-board wheelchairs, and also ensure communication of essential information on a flight be in accessible formats. Likewise, in-flight entertainment must also be in accessible formats.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/category/india\">India</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/author/j-venkatesan\">J.

(Photo: PTI) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evacuation of 29 Indians from Libya has sparked a fierce political row between the BJP-led government in the Centre and the Congress-led Kerala government just days before the state goes to polls on May 16.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking credit for the evacuations, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj hit back in a series of tweets, asking who had paid for the evacuation of thousands of Indians from Libya and other countries in West Asia earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She added that the government viewed the evacuation efforts of distressed Indians as \u201cour pious duty towards our citizens\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine Indians, including 18 people from Kerala, were evacuated from Libya. They reached Kochi on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Detailing the government\u2019s efforts, a ministry of external affairs (MEA) spokesperson said the Indian envoy to Libya, who is based in Tunisia, had flown down to the Libyan capital Tripoli after which exit visas had been arranged for the Indians to return. It was  also ensured that their employers paid their salaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asked about the incident being politicised, the MEA spokesperson said he did not wish to comment on it as it \u201cwould not serve any purpose\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Centre, however, did not refute the Kerala government\u2019s claim that it had paid for the return of the Indians. Government sources said that the 29 Indians did not ask for their airfares to be paid and that the Kerala government might have paid for their return.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Government sources said that about 1,600 Indians were still living and working in Libya despite repeated government advisories asking them to return immediately. This was probably because the Indians were earning very well there and did not think that the dangers of living in Libya outweighed the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Mr Chandy had said that his government was bearing the travel expense of the families, indicating that the Centre had not extended financial assistance for their travel. \u201cSushma Swaraj paid for the earlier evacuations. This time we are paying for their travel,\u201d Mr Chandy was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But in a series of angry tweets, Ms Swaraj stated, \u201cMr Chandy - We evacuated thousands of Indians from Kerala from Iraq, Libya and Yemen. Who paid for them?\u201d She again Tweeted: \u201cMr Chandy - You said \u2018Kerala paid for 29 Indians evacuated from Libya\u2019,\u201d and then \u201cYou started this debate - as to Who paid ? Not me. We always did this because this is our pious duty towards our citizens (sic).\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The political fight erupted a day after Mr Modi said in Kerala that his government had evacuated the families from Libya and that the Centre was committed to work for the welfare of Indians living abroad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday in Kerala, he had said: \u201cOur government has saved six families and evacuated 29 people. The Indian government is committed to working for people who go abroad to work, we have always tried to help them. It gives me immense pleasure and happiness to tell you that they are coming back and will be united with their families soon.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The centre had informed Parliament in December last year that \u201c3,600 Indians have been evacuated from Libya so far\u201d and that \u201cthese evacuations were facilitated through land, air and sea, with the assistance of countries neighbouring Libya\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;India had undertaken a massive evacuation effort in Libya in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/category/india\">India</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/source/age-correspondent\">Age Correspondent</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/place/new-delhi\">New Delhi</category>\n <enclosure url=\"http://www.asianage.com/image/view/494898/preview\" length=\"20178\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\n <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">494899 at http://www.asianage.com</guid>\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>Civic body to spend Rs 32 crore on trimming trees before rains</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.asianage.com/india/civic-body-spend-rs-32-crore-trimming-trees-rains-859</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will spend a whopping Rs 32 crore on the trimming of trees ahead of the monsoon. The proposal has been cleared by the civic tree authority.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to civic officials, several mishaps take place due to tree falling accidents during the monsoon. To avoid them, the civic body carry out trimming of trees on public as well as private places in the city. The branches of dangerous, dead and other trees will be trimmed in this drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The proposal, which was tabled before the committee, was for a period of three years at the cost of Rs 95 crore. However the tree authority members stiffly opposed the proposal. The Shiv Sena party leader in the BMC Trushna Vishwasrao said, \u201cThe proposal was circulated to us just a night before the meeting was to be held. Therefore we have already informed the authorities that we did not have a chance to study the same in detail. While we did not want to pass the entire proposal but with monsoons less than a month away we felt that trimming of trees is essential or else it can be life threatening. Therefore the contract was passed for a year only.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The menace of tree falling accidents has been increasing as last year there were eight deaths due to tree collapse in the city. In all, 33 people have lost their lives due to tree collapse in last 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Among the priorities listed by the BMC for the monsoon season, it  said it will make sure dead trees are uprooted, trees that pose a hazard to life and property will be chopped down, unstable trees will be straightened, while trees that have fallen will be dismantled without any delay.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/category/india\">India</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/source/age-correspondent\">Age Correspondent</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/place/mumbai\">mumbai</category>\n <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">494859 at http://www.asianage.com</guid>\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>29 return from Libya</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.asianage.com/india/29-return-libya-855</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;p&gt;The 18 Keralites who were evacuated from Libya reached Nedumbassery airport on Thursday morning. Another 11 returned to their native places in Tamil Nadu. The families had been stranded in Libya after escaping from a hospital in Tripoli that was destroyed in a shell attack on March 25.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A large number of relatives from different parts of the state had gathered to welcome them. The returnees, which included six children, came back via Istanbul and Dubai after a wait of 47 days. Most of those who returned are nurses working at the Savio Hospital in Tripoli. An Indian nurse and her child were killed in the shell attack on the hospital. The returnees said that the hospital authorities did not care for the safety of the staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Abraham Samuel from Kozhenchery, who was among the 29 Indians, said that the Indian embassy did not do things properly. If it had constructively intervened, their return would have happened much early. He said that they bought air tickets on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Joseph Chacko from Perumpaikadu, Kottayam, said that he and a few others escaped with the help of a Libyan national who was working with them. He took them to another safe place in Libya and lodged them in a cottage for a month. Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy had tried to intervene but the response from the Indian embassy was not that encouraging, he said. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NORKA opened a special helpdesk at the airport to help the returnees reach their destinations. All those above the age of 10 were given `2,000 apart from vehicle to reach home. They said that the warring tribal factions in Libya do not give much hope for their return to the workplace in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Chandy said in Kochi that the allegations that the state government didn\u2019t do anything to help the stranded nurses stranded in Libya were baseless. \u201cWe\u2019ve been coordinating with the Indian embassy and other authorities to safely bring them back. The government will bear the complete expense for their travel, including the airfare. However, due to some technical issues in currency exchange, we couldn\u2019t pay the airfare before their journey,\u201d he said at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey have agreed to buy the ticket on their own for which the government will reimburse it soon. When they reached Nedumbassery, each person was given `2000 as an initial assistance and vehicles were also arranged to take them to their native place.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We were monitoring the situation when they started from their workplaces as journey up to Tripoli is very dangerous.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe government was ready to bring them back when the first group of persons returned. But they were not ready to return citing financial problems,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said in Kochi  that Mr  Modi and  Ms Sushma Swaraj had brought back the nurses stranded in Libya.  Mr Chandy had no role in this. The only contribution of Mr. Chandy was receiving the nurses at the airport after they landed safely in Kerala,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The political fight erupted a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government had  evacuated the families from Libya and that the Centre was committed to work for the welfare of Indians living abroad.  Mr Modi is already under mounting attack from the Opposition parties for his controversial comment in an election rally comparing Kerala and Somalia while talking about the infant mortality rate among tribals in the state.  &lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/category/india\">India</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/source/age-correspondent\">Age Correspondent</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/place/kochinew-delhi\">Kochi/New Delhi</category>\n <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">494855 at http://www.asianage.com</guid>\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>Kerala mulls legal action on Modi</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.asianage.com/india/kerala-mulls-legal-action-modi-852</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Kerala government will probe the possibility of legal action against PM Narendra Modi for his controversial Kerala-Somalia comparison, chief minister Oommen Chandy has said. \u201cEven after the state government sent an explanation letter along with an inquiry report on the Peravoor incident mentioned by the PM, he was not ready to withdraw the remarks during his visit to Kochi on Wednesday. He insulted the state and Keralites across the world who are upset over the remark,\u201d Mr Chandy told reporters here on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSoon after his remarks, an explanation on the reported incident of tribal children in Peravoor foraging for food in a garbage pile was sent to the PM\u2019s office. However, Modi was not ready to withdraw his wrong statement. We will approach the Election Commission seeking legal action,\u201d Mr Chandy said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen Modi compared Kerala with Somalia, he conveniently forgot that he is the Prime Minister of the country. Even after strong protests, he was not ready to withdraw his absurd statement on Kerala whose high human development indicators are widely acknowledged,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThough Modi can politically criticise the government, his remarks should be based on facts and figures as he is not only a BJP leader, but also the PM,\u201d Mr Chandy said. He also compared some of the state\u2019s high social indicators with that of Gujarat and the national average figures to prove the PM\u2019s statement baseless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Peravoor incident, he said, \u201cAs per the inquiry report prepared after visiting the children\u2019s houses and school, there was no poverty or lack of other basic facilities. Their parents are daily labourers and have sufficient income to raise their children,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/category/india\">India</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/source/age-correspondent\">Age Correspondent</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/place/kochi\">Kochi</category>\n <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">494852 at http://www.asianage.com</guid>\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>Raman govt floated tender in shady manner: Prashant Bhushan</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.asianage.com/india/raman-govt-floated-tender-shady-manner-prashant-bhushan-850</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;all-attached-images&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;width: 430px&quot; class=&quot;image-attach-body&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/bhusanjpg-901&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.asianage.com/sites/default/files/images/bhusan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bhusan.jpg&quot; title=&quot;bhusan.jpg&quot;  class=&quot;image image-content_image &quot; width=&quot;430&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swaraj Abhiyan leaders Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan address a press conference regarding the AgustaWestland scam in New Delhi. (Photo: Bunny Smith)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSeeking to drag the BJP into the VVIP helicopter row, Swaraj Abhiyan on Thursday accused the Chhattisgarh government of floating a global tender in a \u201cshady manner\u201d to purchase a specific AgustaWestland helicopter by paying over 30 per cent commission without exploring options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While addressing a press conference here, Swaraj Abhiyan leaders Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav accused the Raman Singh government in the state of paying $1.57 million as commission to a company registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands to procure the helicopter. They also sought to link Mr Raman Singh\u2019s son to the controversy, saying Abhishek Singh formed a company called Quest Heights Ltd on July 3, 2008, almost six months after the bulk of the payment was made by the state government to Sharp Ocean, an agent company. They (Swaraj Abhiyan leaders) sought an enquiry into the deal finalised by the state government by a former judge to be recommended by the CJI. \u201cIt was pretended that the (state) government floated a global tender, while it was (specifically) written in the tender which model was to be purchased. And the bids interestingly were received from AgustaWestland, its commission agent and its service provider itself. And based on that the contract was finalised,\u201d Mr Bhushan said. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He added, \u201cThe contract invoice shows the cost of the helicopter was only $5.1 million, which was paid to AgustaWestland, and a $1.57-million commission was given to commission agent Sharp Ocean based in the British Virgin Islands.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAmazingly, within three days, a meeting took place between representatives of one OSS, supposedly the service provider of AgustaWestland helicopters, in which it made a presentation to the government about the Agusta 109 helicopter and made an offer to supply this helicopter at $6.31 million,\u201d Mr Bhushan said. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He alleged the discussion was followed by \u201csome correspondence\u201d with the company, which told the Chhattisgarh government that if it was to buy a helicopter directly from AgustaWestland, then it would have to wait for more than two years and, therefore, it should deal with its dealer/distributor Sharp Ocean based in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He said the company is registered in the British Virgin Islands, which may be able to supply a pre-sold helicopter earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/category/india\">India</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/source/age-correspondent\">Age Correspondent</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/place/new-delhi\">New Delhi</category>\n <enclosure url=\"http://www.asianage.com/image/view/494901/preview\" length=\"17164\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\n <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">494850 at http://www.asianage.com</guid>\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>BJP says PM remark distorted</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.asianage.com/india/bjp-says-pm-remark-distorted-848</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;all-attached-images&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;width: 430px&quot; class=&quot;image-attach-body&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/jairam-ramesh-847&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.asianage.com/sites/default/files/images/Jairam%20Ramesh%20Congress%20RSS_0_0_0_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jairam Ramesh &quot; title=&quot;Jairam Ramesh &quot;  class=&quot;image image-content_image &quot; width=&quot;430&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Jairam Ramesh &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defending Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s remarks where he compared infant mortality rate in the poll-bound state of Kerala to Somalia, the BJP on Thursday said the PM had done so in the context of a particular tribe in a region of the state and blamed the Opposition for \u201cdistorting\u201d his remarks. However, the Congress which is currently leading the ruling alliance in the state, hit back, alleging that the PM is known to make \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cblatantly false\u201d statements. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Mr Modi faced flak over his remarks, including on the social media, BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma said: \u201cModi said the child mortality rate in the tribe is very high. The situation is more dangerous than Somalia.\u201d He accused the Opposition parties of distorting Mr Modi\u2019s comments for scoring political points. Attacking the PM over his remarks, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said: \u201cHe (the PM) makes statements that are blatantly false, he lies with a straight face and he lies because it is in his nature and for this Prime Minister to go to Kerala and to compare Kerala with Somalia is an insult not only to Kerala but also to all of India.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Ramesh said everyone knows that Kerala is \u201cNumber 1\u201d in the country when it comes to social development indicators, like education, health, female literacy, women empowerment and infant mortality. He said the southern state is \u201cfar ahead\u201d of Gujarat, Mr Modi\u2019s home state, in these social indicators. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t know why and what the provocation was for the Prime Minister to bring up Somalia and to compare Kerala with Somalia. This is an outrageous comment to make. It is not only an insult to all Keralites but to the entire nation as quality of life and social indicators of Kerala are better than most countries in the world, including the US,\u201d claimed the leader.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/category/india\">India</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/source/age-correspondent\">Age Correspondent</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.asianage.com/category/place/new-delhi\">New Delhi</category>\n <enclosure url=\"http://www.asianage.com/image/view/494847/preview\" length=\"11662\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\n <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">494848 at http://www.asianage.com</guid>\n  </item>\r\n  </channel>\r\n</rss>\n<!-- Page cached by Boost @ 2016-05-13 11:50:50, expires @ 2016-05-13 12:50:50 -->\n",
