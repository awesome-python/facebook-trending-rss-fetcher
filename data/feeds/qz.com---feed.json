South Africa is already seventh in the world\u2014and ahead of Europe\u2014in shopping center space, according to 2013 numbers from retail <a href=\"http://urbanstudies.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Whats-new_June-2015.pdf\">research group Urban Studies</a> (pdf) and now has roughly 2,000 shopping centers for its population of 53 million.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also in <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2016/04/28/Mall-of-Africa-opens-in-South-Africa-as-economic-outlook-sours\">an economic slump</a>, spurred by a drop in commodity prices, 25% unemployment, political uncertainty and rising interest rates.</p>\n<p>Mall of Africa, which began building during a <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2014-10-02-the-magnificent-march-of-sas-malls\">boom time for malls</a>, will have to confront these risks head on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When this was planned a couple of years ago, not most of these factors were so known,&#8221; says Fourie. But, he adds, &#8220;if I look at what\u2019s happening around us, as bad as the economy is, people are still\u2014I don&#8217;t know why\u2014but they are still really spending money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mall of Africa cost an estimated 5 billion rand ($332 million) to build and is <a href=\"http://www.financialmail.co.za/fmfox/2016/05/05/mall-of-africa-mall-mania-continues\">co-owned</a> by South African real estate capital growth fund Attacq and property developers Atterbury.

This holds huge appeal for people of all races\u2014with the result that malls are often the most desegregated spaces in the country, which still struggles with incidences of racism, 20 years after the end of apartheid.</p>\n<p>Strong economic growth, a well-developed formal banking sector, and a flood of new consumers into the market since apartheid\u2019s end has also helped malls succeed, says Urban Studies director Dirk Nico Prinsloo. \u201cThe shift from informal to formal retail has been substantial and has been strong.\u201d</p>\n<figure id=\"image-679746\" class=\"inline-image  alignright zoomable size-large\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/mall-of-africa-12.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1024\" data-retina=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/mall-of-africa-12.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1024\" alt=\"\" title=\"Specially designated helpers and maps located on walkways enable visitors to navigate their way around the Mall of Africa&#8217;s 1.4 million square feet.\"/><figcaption class=\"inline-image-caption\"><i class=\"icon-camera\"></i>Specially designated helpers and maps located on walkways enable visitors to navigate their way around the Mall of Africa&#8217;s 1.4 million square feet.<span class=\"inline-image-credit\">(Cornell Tukiri)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>These factors, combined with the country&#8217;s strong mall culture, have helped the country&#8217;s megamalls, several of which count more than 100,000 square meters (1 million square feet) of retail space, weather the ups and downs of the local economy.</p>\n<p>Walk through the retail spaces in Johannesburg\u2019s wealthier suburbs today, and you\u2019d be hard pressed to find evidence of the economic pressures currently plaguing the country.</p>\n<p>Malls attract crowds on a daily basis, and newly launched American standards such as Krispy Kreme and Starbucks are still attracting long lines weeks after opening. Online shopping hasn\u2019t yet taken off in the country, leaving brick-and-mortar stores relatively untouched; an estimated <a href=\"http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/retail/2016/04/28/mall-of-africa-smaller-than-many-in-the-developing-world\">40 new shopping centers</a> are planned or currently under construction across the country.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"S1JRdAlG\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_S1JRdAlG.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>\u201cConsumer spending is our Wiley Coyote,\u201d says Mike Schussler, the chief economist at <a href=\"http://www.economists.co.za/\">Economists.co.za</a>. While spending on houses, cars, and other durable goods has faded somewhat, retail and other sectors like fast food and hardware are still going strong.</p>\n<p>Eventually, \u201cthe South African consumer is going to be under pressure,&#8221; Schussler says. But he argues that the spending power of South Africans abroad and of visitors to the country shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. \u201cI think we forget how many South Africans are outside of the country, sending money home,\u201d he says.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-679748\" class=\"inline-image  alignright zoomable size-medium\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/mall-of-africa-13.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=640\" data-retina=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/mall-of-africa-13.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1024\" alt=\"\" title=\"There are only two Starbucks locations in South Africa, and one of them is at Mall of Africa.\"/><figcaption class=\"inline-image-caption\"><i class=\"icon-camera\"></i>There are only two Starbucks locations in South Africa, and one of them is at Mall of Africa.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The mall has mitigated some of the economic risk, Fourie says, by ensuring the presence of stalwart &#8220;big box&#8221; retailers and by limiting the number of restaurants, which are often the first to go in a recession. They\u2019ve also avoided first-time traders, which pose a risk if the economy sours, he says.</p>\n<p>To deal with cash heists, one of the biggest issues plaguing South Africa\u2019s malls, the company is installing a cash recycling system, sending spent money into an on-site vault and distributing it back to transaction centers. More than a dozen generators are on standby to deal with the country\u2019s frequent power cuts, and the mall will have environmental offsets including solar panels and water recycling.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-679749\" class=\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-extra-large\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/mall-of-africa-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1024\" data-retina=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/mall-of-africa-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1024\" alt=\"\" title=\"Analysts believe the mall&#8217;s location, off a busy highway, in a rapidly developing area and far from competitors, might help it weather the country&#8217;s economic downturn.\"/><figcaption class=\"inline-image-caption\"><i class=\"icon-camera\"></i>Analysts believe the mall&#8217;s location, off a busy highway, in a rapidly developing area and far from competitors, might help it weather the country&#8217;s economic downturn.<span class=\"inline-image-credit\">(Cornell Tukiri)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Then, there\u2019s Africa&#8217;s wealthy, who <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Where-Africas-rich-live-20150429\">already flock</a> to the upscale Sandton City shopping center, a short distance from Johannesburg\u2019s main airport using the high-speed Gautrain, to shop international brands. Mall of Africa, located on a Gautrain shuttle bus route, plans to take advantage of these spenders.</p>\n<p>Waterfall City&#8217;s developers aim to build out 20,000 residential units in a five-kilometer (three-mile) radius around Mall of Africa in the next eight years. Some 3,000 already have been built, according to Prinsloo. The fact that new development already is being planned around the mall, and that the nearest large shopping center is miles away, might help buffer the mall from retail pressures in the years to come, he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be centers that are going to struggle over the next five years, especially those located in the \u2018greenfield\u2019 spaces that were developed based on the expectation of future growth,\u201d says Prinsloo. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely not Mall of Africa.\u201d</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/bYMaQn\" target=\"_blank\">Sign

class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"india-raghuram-rajan-subramanian-swamy\" /><p>A senior leader of India&#8217;s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has questioned the competency of the man who rightly predicted the global economic crisis of 2008.</p>\n<p>On May 12, Subramanian Swamy\u2014the BJP&#8217;s enfant terrible\u2014declared that Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan should be sent back to Chicago since he is unfit to be a central banker. Rajan&#8217;s three-year term is set to end this September.</p>\n<p>Rajan is currently on leave from the University of Chicago&#8217;s Booth School of Business, where he&#8217;s a professor of finance.</p>\n<p>There has been some friction between Rajan and the Narendra Modi government <a href=\"http://qz.com/465349/could-a-toothless-central-bank-be-indias-future/\">in the last few months</a>, but Swamy&#8217;s rationale for such bold remarks is pretty bizarre. Here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/subramanian-swamy-embarrasses-government-says-raghuram-rajan-not-fit-as-rbi-governor/articleshow/52237381.cms\" target=\"_blank\">what Swamy said:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>In my opinion, RBI governor is not appropriate for the country. I don&#8217;t want to speak much about him. He has hiked interest rates in the garb of controlling inflation that has damaged the country&#8230;(his actions) led to collapse of industry and rise of unemployment in the economy&#8230;The sooner he is sent back to Chicago, the better it would be.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Before jumping the gun, Swamy, once <a href=\"http://harvardmagazine.com/2011/12/occupy-harvard-subramanian-swamy-teaching-debated\" target=\"_blank\">a visiting professor</a> at Harvard University, should&#8217;ve have paid more attention to economics. Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;He has hiked interest rates in the garb of controlling inflation. That has damaged the country&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Rajan did hike key interest rates in the country soon after he took control in August 2013. But it was more of a necessity than a choice. Retail inflation in Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy was high, at <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/india-rbi-idINDEE98J02W20130920\" target=\"_blank\">about 9.52% then.</a> A rate cut or hike is the most common tool available for policy makers to contain inflation.</p>\n<p>When prices of food and commodities are high, increasing the money supply in the economy pumps up demand, thus driving inflation upwards. Rate cuts in such scenarios mean letting more money into the system. An <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/basics/monpol.htm\" target=\"_blank\">increase in interest rates</a>, on the other hand, restricts money supply, pulling down demand. This, in turn, brings down inflation.</p>\n<p>Sure, lower rates are one way to boost economic activity, but consumers are typically concerned with inflation, and managing growth and inflation is often tricky. And Rajan made it clear that his main objective was to bring down inflation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What is equally worrisome is that inflation at the retail level, measured by the CPI, has been high for a number of years, entrenching inflation expectations at elevated levels and eroding consumer and business confidence,&#8221; <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/india-rbi-idINDEE98J02W20130920\" target=\"_blank\">he said in Sept. 2013,</a> during his maiden monetary policy announcement. He raised the repo rate 25 basis points to 7.50% on that day.</p>\n<p>Since then, he has hiked the repo rate <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/interest-rate\" target=\"_blank\">only twice</a>. For most of 2014, he held rates, until inflation was under control and dropped below 6%. In March 2015, Rajan signed a formal agreement with the government to set an inflation target. The RBI will be held accountable in case it fails to stick to the targets set: within 6% by Jan. 2016, and within 4% for the following years. In April, retail inflation <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/retail-inflation-accelerates-to-5-39-per-cent-in-april-iip-growth-down-to-0-1-in-march/articleshow/52240306.cms\" target=\"_blank\">was at 5.39%</a>. Now the repo rate is at 6.5%, the lowest in five years.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;(His actions) led to the collapse of industry and rise of unemployment in the economy&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Rajan took charge when the global economy was in the middle of the worst financial crisis since 1991. Major economies around the world were slowing, and India wasn&#8217;t an exception.</p>\n<p>The Indian economy <a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fIfBBI43QFsyChqKzeJD7I/Indias-economic-growth-slows-to-fouryear-low-in-June-quart.html\" target=\"_blank\">grew at just 4.4%</a> in the June quarter of 2012-13, the slowest in four years. Since then, unlike Swamy&#8217;s claims of an industrial collapse, India&#8217;s GDP growth has improved to over 7%. This is partly also because the method to calculate economic output was changed in January 2015.</p>\n<p>Besides, Swamy&#8217;s boss, prime minister Narendra Modi, has reiterated that all is well with the economy. Government data shows that <a href=\"http://qz.com/667598/india-attracted-more-fdi-than-china-in-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">foreign direct investment (FDI)</a> is at a multi-year high and <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/narendra-modi-govt-creates-2-75-lakh-jobs-118-jump-y-o-y-between-jul-dec-2014/80833/\" target=\"_blank\">over 2.75 lakh jobs</a> have been created under Modi.</p>\n<p>To say then that Rajan&#8217;s policies led to a rise in unemployment is doubting the government&#8217;s credentials, if anything.</p>\n<h2>Banker of the year</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, Rajan has often stood out among his peers.</p>\n<p>The Banker magazine named him <a href=\"http://profit.ndtv.com/news/banking-finance/article-raghuram-rajan-conferred-central-banker-award-by-ft-group-arm-1263360\" target=\"_blank\">Central Banker of 2016</a>, lauding his efforts to stimulate growth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Under Rajan, the management of monetary policy has been extremely effective, not only in terms of the use of the policy rate tools, notably the repo rate and reverse repo rate, but also through skilful management of liquidity in the financial system through tools such as open market operations and the use of the cash reserve ratio,&#8221; said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist, IHS Global, a consultancy.</p>\n<p>Charan Singh, the RBI chair professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore, said that &#8220;inflation targeting&#8221; has been Rajan&#8217;s biggest achievement. &#8220;He (Rajan) has certainly been able to anchor inflationary expectations. Despite all criticisms, he persisted and prevailed to ensure that inflation rate is down,&#8221; Singh said in an email.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The monetary policy is a tight-rope walk and there are many parameters that need to be taken into consideration. Interest rate is one, but developments in the external sector also have a role to play in exports. Similarly, supply side factors, el Nino, climate change in terms of floods and hailstorms, droughts, hoarding, etc, all have a role in price setting. On regulation and supervision of banking, he has been transparent,&#8221; Singh added.</p>\n<p>Whether Rajan will get a second term or not is the government&#8217;s call, but Swamy needs to check his facts again.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=682803&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/subramanian-swamy.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/subramanian-swamy.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Subramanian Swamy</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Kerala is discarding centuries of religious harmony to become like the rest of India</title>\n\t\t<link>http://qz.com/679937/it-is-election-time-and-a-dangerous-tide-is-rising-again-in-kerala/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 05:36:53 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Harish C Menon]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Angadippuram]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BDJS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BJP]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Buddhist]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[catholic]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[census]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Cherpulassery]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[christianity]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Election]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hindu]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[india]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Islam]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Judaism]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kerala]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kochi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kodungallur]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kummanam]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[LDF]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lok Sabha]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[M B Rajesh]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Malayali]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Maplah]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Marthoma Pontifical Shrine]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[marxist]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Muziris]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Narendra Modi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NDA]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NSS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[O Rajagopal]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Palakkad]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Panakkad Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Periyar]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ponnani]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Popular Front of India]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[prophet mohammed]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sabarimala]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[SNDP]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[St Thomas]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[UDF]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vellapally Natesan]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/preview/679937</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Kodungallur is a bustling temple town of 94,000 at the mouth of River Periyar in the southern Indian state of Kerala.

For centuries, it was also a Buddhist pilgrimage centre. Muziris was wiped out in a cataclysmic flooding of the Periyar in 1341 .</p>\n<p>However, vestiges of such a remarkable past are alive here: Muslim households carry Hindu names, Hindu festivals are <a href=\"http://mappilasseryfamily.blogspot.in/search/label/The%20legend%20behind%20the%20%27Moolam%27%20boat%20race\" target=\"_blank\">ritually linked</a> to non-Hindu entities and <a href=\"http://www.nasrani.net/2007/01/12/preserved-traditions-rituals-of-christians-of-kerala/\" target=\"_blank\">Christians follow</a> Hindu traditions.</p>\n<p>But this syncretism that has defined Kodungallur, and indeed much of Kerala, is at risk of being torn apart by widening religious schisms in the state. These divisions, accentuated by hardening identity politics, could even influence the results of the Kerala state assembly elections scheduled for May 16.</p>\n<p>While religion has played a behind-the-screen role in alliances and candidate-selection during past elections, its growing clout in the current election cycle seems unprecedented.</p>\n<p>Ruled alternatively by the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Marxist-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) since 1957, Kerala has managed to provide its population of 33.3 million<strong> </strong>an enviable level of social development, surpassing much of India. It has consistently topped the chart in almost all indicators of <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/india/hdi-in-india-rises-by-21-kerala-leads-gujarat-far-behind-114044.html\" target=\"_blank\">human development index</a> including education, income equality, healthcare, and women&#8217;s empowerment.</p>\n<p>Kerala&#8217;s political parties have also achieved another feat: Keeping prime minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) off their turf.</p>\n<p>But this election may change things. The BJP, which has conspicuously stayed off religion and associated subjects in its campaign, may\u2014like <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/bjp-gains-in-polls-after-every-riot-says-yale-study/articleshow/45378840.cms\" target=\"_blank\">in the rest of India</a>\u2014turn out to be the biggest beneficiary of Kerala&#8217;s widening social chasms. Indications are that the party will send its first elected representative to the state assembly this time.</p>\n<p>In Kodungallur, some residents are clearly nervous.</p>\n<h2><strong>Peaking &#8220;devotion&#8221;</strong></h2>\n<p>&#8220;We feel people are drifting apart in the name of religion,&#8221; said Father Jose Frank, a Catholic priest who lives at Kodungallur&#8217;s revered <a href=\"http://www.marthomaresearchacademy.com/st.thomasshrine.html\" target=\"_blank\">St Thomas Shrine</a>. This shrine is a monument to the first-ever church believed to have been established in south Asia after St Thomas arrived here in 52 CE, marking the advent of Christianity in India.</p>\n<p>Today, Christians form around 18% of Kerala&#8217;s population, the third biggest religious community after Hindus and Muslims.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"Sy_ScRef\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_Sy_ScRef.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"HJ-Aq0lM\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_HJ-Aq0lM.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;There is a strong fanatic movement among Christians,&#8221; the senior member of the clergy revealed. &#8220;I have had people come up to me and confess that they ate <em>Aravana</em> (a delicious pudding pilgrims bring back from the Sabarimala temple). There are those who think Bharatanatyam ought to be shunned because it is related to the Hindus. I fear this situation will worsen in Kerala.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The elderly, soft-spoken, but no-nonsense priest points at the increasingly grandiose new churches to further his argument.</p>\n<p>In fact, a 250-km journey through Kerala&#8217;s spine revealed something of a revolution underway among all religions. Old temples are being rigorously refurbished and snazzy mosques are under construction.</p>\n<p>But why?</p>\n<p>Leaders of each community point at the others.</p>\n<p>Temple revival is simply a manifestation of Hindus returning to their roots, explained G Sukumaran Nair, general secretary of the Nair Service Society (NSS), an organisation working for the Hindu Nair community <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/politics/guess-whos-after-the-hindu-vote-in-kerala-hint-its-not-the-bjp-2619712.html\" target=\"_blank\">that forms 14%</a> of Kerala&#8217;s population. The NSS is traditionally <a href=\"http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030728/asp/nation/story_2207612.asp\" target=\"_blank\">known to back the Congress party</a>. &#8220;Temple renovations do not imply any Hindu consolidation,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>New mosques, though, are entirely another matter. &#8220;Among Muslims it is a case of assertion of identity,&#8221; Nair said.</p>\n<p>Some of these new mosques, it is alleged, are a result of <a href=\"http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-wahhabis-are-taking-over-indian-mosques-spending-crores-to-grow-ib/20140801.htm#1\">Arab funds</a> pouring into the state. A conservative strain of Islam is seen to be taking root here through places of worship, educational institutions, and other organisations that have direct links with donors <a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/2016/02/the-new-threat-to-islam-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\">in the Middle East</a>. Kerala, after all, is known for its diaspora in the Gulf countries, bringing in remittances of over <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/other-news/Remittances-by-NRIs-to-Kerala-cross-Rs-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/47570226.cms\" target=\"_blank\">Rs1 lakh crore</a> ($15 billion) in 2015.</p>\n<p>However, that&#8217;s a hypothesis Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal, a senior leader of the Congress-allied Indian Union Muslim League party, refuses to buy. &#8220;Centuries ago, Ponnani (in Malappuram district) had one of the most number of mosques. People weren&#8217;t frequenting Saudi Arabia then,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hindus are renovating temples in a big way. Is it because Modi visited Arab countries?&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Religion and politics</h2>\n<p>If these grass-root changes aren&#8217;t proof enough of creeping fundamentalism, Kerala has also witnessed violence in the name of religion, and even instances of terrorist activities in recent years. In the past few years, media organisations have <a href=\"http://scroll.in/article/804918/despite-apology-keralas-mathrubhumi-newspaper-faces-online-boycott-drive-from-radical-muslim-groups\" target=\"_blank\">come under attack </a>and scholars have been <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/hindu-group-forces-muslim-writer-to-stop-ramayana-column/\" target=\"_blank\">threatened into silence</a> by religious fanatics of all hues.</p>\n<p>In 2010, a Christian professor of Malayalam language had his <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/13-guilty-of-chopping-kerala-professors-hand/\" target=\"_blank\">arms chopped off</a> by a radical Muslim outfit, Popular Front of India, for allegedly insulting Prophet Mohammed. It has also emerged that the <a href=\"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/current-affairs/200116/wayanad-on-national-terror-radar.html\" target=\"_blank\">south India commander</a> and chief recruiter of the dreaded Lashkar-e-Taiba is from Kerala.</p>\n<p>To be sure, political violence is not new to Kerala. For many years, Marxists and functionaries of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP&#8217;s ideological fountainhead, have indulged in deadly violence against each other way too often.</p>\n<p>But the religious violence of recent years is a new addition to that deadly cocktail.</p>\n<p>M Pradeep Kumar, secretary of Kannur-based <a href=\"http://keralafolkloreakademy.com/about_us.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kerala Folklore Akademi</a>, an independent centre for cultural affairs, surmises that this is because the youth are increasingly depoliticised. &#8220;When political awareness recedes, religious and caste feelings surge. People are being convinced that what is needed is not ideology but religious fervour,&#8221; Kumar said.</p>\n<p>Indeed, for long, ideology has been the sheet anchor of Kerala&#8217;s society. Entire generations have been bred on the two chief streams of political thought: anti-feudalism as represented by the Leftists, and nationalism espoused by the Congress. These ideologies seeped into student union levels, weaning legions of leaders in schools and colleges.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s also been a change in Kerala&#8217;s education sector, dominated for decades by government-run institutions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When public education was strong, students from all sections of society would attend these schools,&#8221; said M B Rajesh, a Communist Party of India-Marxist parliamentarian from Palakkad.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"http://www.keralabudgetwatch.org/news/outlay-for-school-edu-faces-steady-decline-2/\" target=\"_blank\">the state&#8217;s gradual withdrawal,</a> he said, education is now moving into the hands of institutions run by caste and religioun-based organisations. &#8220;Today, you can identify the character of the institutions by their name. Each caste, each religion has its own school or college,&#8221; Rajesh said.</p>\n<h2>Minority appeasement</h2>\n<p>Given the situation, the ground seems fertile for the mainstreaming of radical religion in the state. And that may already be happening. &#8220;There are places where anonymous persons have put up posters that simply put out statistics like &#8216;54% are Hindus, 24% are Christians and 11% are Muslims. So who should rule?&#8217; The intent is very clear,&#8221; Nair of NSS said.</p>\n<p>When asked to name the suspects, he replied: &#8220;People who are indulging in such divisions are related to those ruling the country.&#8221; The allusion to the BJP is clear.</p>\n<p>The BJP itself hasn&#8217;t waded into issues of religion and community. Rarely has any top party leader\u2014be it veteran O Rajagopal or the party&#8217;s state chief Kummanam Rajasekharan\u2014uttered anything on these lines.</p>\n<p>Instead, it is organisations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-affiliated Hindu Aikya Vedi (HAV) that are <a href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Hindu-Aikya-Vedi-State-Meet-Ends/2015/04/06/article2749838.ece\" target=\"_blank\">harping on subjects</a>\u2014through their <a href=\"http://www.hinduaikyavedi.org/2011/10/sasikala-teachers-speech-on-love-jihad.html\" target=\"_blank\">polemical diatribes</a>\u2014that BJP leaders elsewhere have developed a reputation for. Some of the favoured topics among HAV speakers during public speeches include &#8220;beef&#8221;, &#8220;conversions&#8221;, and &#8220;love-jihad.&#8221; These are not issues that would&#8217;ve made an appearance in election hustings even a decade ago.</p>\n<p>When asked about HAV&#8217;s divisive rhetoric, Rajasekharan, who himself was once HAV&#8217;s general secretary, made his stand clear: &#8220;Beef is not an issue in Kerala&#8230; Hindutva is not an issue&#8230; Development and the concept of development are the issues. Why should the BJP comment on the Hindu Aikya Vedi? Any move to disturb communal and religious harmony will be opposed by the BJP.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But the BJP won&#8217;t condemn the fringe group. &#8220;Why are you naming only the Hindu Aikya Vedi?&#8221; Rajasekharan retorted. &#8220;It could be the Congress or the Communist party, too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some even feel that Kerala&#8217;s Hindus have a right to be angry. &#8220;If social justice was implemented here, we wouldn\u2019t have any of these (communal) problems,&#8221; said Vellappally Natesan, secretary-general of the Sri Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam. According to him, the UDF and LDF&#8217;s only stratagem to gain power has been appeasement of minorities. &#8220;All authority and assets are being channelized towards the minorities. Nobody wants the majority community of Kerala,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The SNDP works for the welfare of the Ezhava caste, which forms 23% of the state&#8217;s population.</p>\n<p>Natesan is also the founder of a party called the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), which has aligned with the National Democratic Alliance led by Modi&#8217;s BJP. Asked if there was unrest among Hindus, he said, &#8220;Definitely. That is why the BJP has gained a foothold in Kerala. Appeasing the minorities is torturing the majority.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His view is clear: The state&#8217;s two main political groupings\u2014UDF and LDF\u2014have had an active role in polarising people.</p>\n<h2><strong>A different world, a receding world</strong></h2>\n<p>Some time back, authorities at the Thirumandhamkunnu temple near Palakkad&#8217;s Cherpulassery town\u2014around 100km north of Kodungallur\u2014wanted an entrance arch built. The person they approached was one Kalathinkal Mohammed, a building contractor born and raised in the locality, and an ardent devotee of the presiding goddess.</p>\n<p>The officials offered to inscribe Mohammed&#8217;s name on the structure. That was two years ago.<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span><span>People within the family are moving apart. Communities staying together is a huge ask.</span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>Today, a simple entrance arch and wall enclose the temple complex. There are no names inscribed because Mohammed shunned the idea. &#8220;The temple is a public place of worship. An individual&#8217;s name has no relevance there,&#8221; Mohammed, 78, said, bogged down by asthma.</p>\n<p>As his wife, Pathumma, rattled out details of all temple festivals in the neighbourhood, I asked Mohammed: &#8220;Are people in his neighbourhood moving apart over religion?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Son,&#8221; he said teary-eyed, &#8220;People within the family are moving apart. Communities staying together is a huge ask.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>We welcome your comments at <a href=\"http://ideas.india@qz.com/\">ideas.india@qz.com</a>.</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=679937&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kerala.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kerala.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Dancers in body paint wait to take part in a performance during festivities marking the start of the annual harvest festival of &#34;Onam&#34; in the southern Indian city of Kochi</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>China is building a Muslim theme park to promote its state-sanctioned version of Islam</title>\n\t\t<link>http://qz.com/683589/china-is-building-a-muslim-theme-park-to-promote-its-state-sanctioned-version-of-islam/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 05:00:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Elizabeth Winkler]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[arab world]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Beijing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[China]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hui people]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Islam]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[qzhw]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uighur Muslims]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/preview/683589</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Since 1958, Yinchuan, a city 600 miles west of Beijing, has been the capital of the Ningxia region governed by China\u2019s Hui Muslims.

Now China\u2019s leaders are spending $3.5 billion to turn it into a \u201cWorld Muslim City,\u201d replete with a mosque-like \u201cGolden Palace,\u201d Arabic street signs, and an elaborate light and dance show inspired by <em>The Thousand and One Nights, </em>that is, the version in which Aladdin was born in China.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s part of the government\u2019s larger bid to improve relations with the Arab world by emphasizing shared Sino-Arab history and culture.</p>\n<p>China has come under criticism for its repressive treatment of Muslims, especially the Uighurs\u2014Turkic-speaking Muslims who live in the country\u2019s Xinjian region. Last year, Turkey denounced China\u2019s policies, prompting protesters in Istanbul to attack local Chinese establishments. In December, the Islamic State released a chant, in fluent Mandarin, calling on Muslims to \u201cwake up\u201d and overcome \u201ca century of slavery.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beijing has a vested interest in promoting a more positive image of Chinese Islam. President Xi Jinping published a <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2016-01/13/c_135006619.htm\">white paper</a> in January detailing his ambitious plans to increase China\u2019s influence in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Noticeably, leaders chose <em>not </em>to build the theme park in Uighur territory. Hui Muslims, unlike Uighurs, speak Mandarin and are ethnically related to the Han majority. Their name is less likely to be invoked in relation to terrorism or police crackdowns. By building the theme park in Yinchuan, Chinese leaders are trying to shift the focus to this officially approved version of Islam.</p>\n<p>Will the strategy work? The park seems to possess all the cultural sensitivity and sophistication of Disney\u2019s Epcot. Female visitors who desire an authentic mosque experience can be fitted with a makeshift abaya. Tourists are encouraged to dress their kids in traditional outfits from the gift shop.</p>\n<p>A 900,000 square-foot terminal is being added at the nearby airport to accommodate the hoped-for flocks of Arab tourists. Soon there will be direct flights from Amman and Kuala Lumpur. So far, the park has drawn few visitors. As Beijing continues to crack down on human rights and free expression, China&#8217;s Muslim Disneyland comes off as another expensive, ill-conceived PR attempt to artificially beautify a defective civil society.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=683589&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\"

I was born at the bottom of the ten slices of the pyramid. It wasn&#8217;t easy. But today, I am at the top of the very pyramid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last week, Thyrocare, the company Velumani founded two decades ago, made its debut on Indian bourses, with a valuation of Rs3,377 crore ($505 million), as on May 13. Velumani <a href=\"http://www.btvin.com/videos/watch/17559/thyrocare--stake-pie-post-ipo\">owns a 64% stake in the company</a>. That makes him worth at least $323 million.</p>\n<p>Thyrocare <a href=\"http://www.thyrocare.com/ftc/ftmhome.aspx\">claims to be the world&#8217;s largest</a> thyroid testing company, with a network of 1,122 outlets<strong> </strong>across India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and the Middle East. It also runs one of India&#8217;s largest network of  health diagnostic labs, processing over nine million samples and conducting over 30 million medical tests every year.</p>\n<h2>From scientist to entrepreneur</h2>\n<p>Velumani&#8217;s career began with a job as a shift chemist at Gemini Capsules, a small pharmaceutical company in Coimbatore, in 1979. The 20-year-old chemistry graduate earned a paltry Rs150 ($2.25 currently) every month. Three years later, the company shut down and Velumani suddenly found himself without a job.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That was a blessing in disguise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Only when you are pushed hard or thrown out, you want to achieve more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Velumani applied to the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), one of India&#8217;s finest atomic research centres in Mumbai, for the job of a lab assistant. He was accepted. But once inside the prestigious centre\u2014named after Homi J Bhabha, the founder of India&#8217;s nuclear energy program\u2014Velumani decided to study further.</p>\n<p>He began with a master&#8217;s degree in 1985 and eventually completed his doctoral program in thyroid biochemistry by 1995, through a tie-up program that the University of Mumbai had with BARC. &#8220;Those days, I was earning and learning,&#8221; recalled Velumani, &#8220;BARC allowed scientists to study and research further.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In 1982, I did not know where the thyroid gland was,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;By 1995, I was a PhD in thyroid biochemistry.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, he also rose to the rank of a scientist and was posted at the <a href=\"http://www.barc.gov.in/rcaindia/rca_indian_expertise_human_health_1.html\">Radiation Medicine Centre</a> (RMC), a BARC department that focused on the application of nuclear energy in healthcare and agriculture.</p>\n<p>But some 14 years after he started work at BARC, Velumani put in his papers. He had decided that he wanted to use his expertise in thyroid biochemistry to set up testing labs to detect thyroid disorders. With the Rs100,000 ($1,500) that he collected through his provident fund, Velumani set up shop in Byculla, a middle-class neighbourhood in South Mumbai, which is a short distance from the Tata Memorial Hospital, a prominent cancer institute. He was 37-years-old then.</p>\n<p>Velumani&#8217;s wife, who died in February this year, due to pancreatic cancer, quit her job at the State Bank of India to become his first employee. &#8220;As with any business, the initial years were difficult,&#8221; said Velumani. &#8220;But when you are passionate about something, those pains also become a pleasure.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Thyrocare&#8217;s business model</h2>\n<p>India has a massive thyroid disorder problem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-in-10-Indians-suffer-from-thyroid-disorder-Study/articleshow/46007453.cms\">One in every 10 person</a> in the country suffers from hypothyroidism; women are especially vulnerable. But the detection rate of the condition remains <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-in-10-Indians-suffer-from-thyroid-disorder-Study/articleshow/46007453.cms\">abysmally low</a>, even though the condition <a href=\"http://nrhm.gov.in/images/pdf/programmes/maternal-health/guidelines/National_Guidelines_for_Screening_of_Hypothyroidism_during_Pregnancy.pdf\">results in</a> preterm births, intrauterine growth restriction, respiratory distress and increased perinatal mortality in pregnant women.</p>\n<p>With an eye on the huge potential for thyroid testing, Velumani started out with a franchise model where samples would be collected across the country and sent back to the central laboratory in Mumbai. Procuring samples, according to Velumani, was the toughest part since they had to come from different corners of the country, while processing them was much easier.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-681452\" class=\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/aptio_panorama.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=640\" data-retina=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/aptio_panorama.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1024\" alt=\"\" title=\"Thyrocare lab in Mumbai\"/><figcaption class=\"inline-image-caption\"><i class=\"icon-camera\"></i>Thyrocare lab in Mumbai<span class=\"inline-image-credit\">(Thyrocare)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#8220;When we started out, we realised that we needed 25 samples every day to make the business cost effective,&#8221;said 57-year-old Velumani. &#8220;But, we were in it for the long run. We charged one-fourth of what the market was charging for the testing and built our business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Velumani accepts that there wasn&#8217;t much technological innovation that he brought to the table, there was certainly a change in the business model. &#8220;Back in the day, no labs could get more than two samples a day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I worked on improving the business to business model and introduced the franchise model, which helped increase the number of samples per day, making operations cost effective.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Over the years, from simply focussing on thyroid disorders, Velumani and his team expanded the business into health diagnostics, including preventive medical check ups, blood tests, ultrasound scans and pulmonary function tests. It&#8217;s an industry that has grown at a solid clip of <a href=\"http://www.moneycontrol.com/currency/reports/ipo-review-\u2013-thyrocare-technologies-ltd-report-\u2013-apr-25-2016-icici-direct-103001.html\">over 16% annually</a> in the past three years, and <a href=\"http://www.moneycontrol.com/currency/reports/ipo-review-%E2%80%93-thyrocare-technologies-ltd-report-%E2%80%93-apr-25-2016-icici-direct-103001.html\">is expected to be worth</a> Rs61,600 crore ($9.8 billion) by 2018.</p>\n<p>Today, Thyrocare <a href=\"http://www.thyrocare.com/Test_Menu.asp\">offers all sorts of health diagnostics</a>, from a sexually transmitted diseases (STD) profile to metabolism, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and infertility tests. But the focus on thyroid disorders still remains, with almost 28% of the samples tested by the company annually accounting for thyroid tests. The company has a centralised laboratory in Mumbai, supported by four regional testing labs in India. Over the next two years, the company wants to set up <a href=\"http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/ipo-new-listings/targetting-4-fold-increaselabsnext-year-thyrocare_6580461.html\">20 new laboratories </a>across the country.</p>\n<p>Thyrocare is also developing a subsidiary to focus on cancer screening through molecular imaging.</p>\n<h2>Runaway success</h2>\n<p>Thyrocare&#8217;s success in the past two decades had also brought it closer to India&#8217;s private equity players.</p>\n<p>In 2011, New Delhi-based CX Partners <a href=\"http://forbesindia.com/article/hidden-gems/thyrocare-technologies-testing-new-waters-in-medical-diagnostics/41051/1\">picked up a 30% stake</a> in Thyrocare for Rs188 crore ($28 million), valuing the company at about Rs600 crore ($100 million). Since then, <a href=\"http://businessworld.in/article/Thyrocare-IPO-To-Be-Priced-Between-Rs-409-Rs-446-/18-04-2016-97016/\">other investors</a>, including Samara Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, and ICICI Bank\u2019s Emerging India Fund, have bought into the company.</p>\n<p>In fact, the recently concluded IPO\u2014which saw Thyrocare&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/ipo-new-listings/thyrocare-tech-debuts-at-rs-665sh-49-premiumissue-price_6578601.html\">shares being oversubscribed</a> 73 times\u2014was to provide an exit route for the existing investors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our success is mostly due to two reasons,&#8221; explained Velumani. &#8220;One, in the last 20 years, we have never taken on debt. Second, over the last ten years, we have always kept Rs60 crore ($9 million) aside in cash.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2015, the company&#8217;s standalone revenue stood at Rs187 crore ($28 million) while its net profit stood at Rs48 crore ($7.2 million).</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"B1xa1DeM\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_B1xa1DeM.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>But it&#8217;s a centralised business model that comes with its own set of risks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thyrocare\u2019s multi-lab model encompasses a fully automated CPL (centralised processing laboratory) supported by four RPLs (regional processing laboratory),&#8221; ICICI Direct, a brokerage, <a href=\"http://www.moneycontrol.com/currency/reports/ipo-review-%E2%80%93-thyrocare-technologies-ltd-report-%E2%80%93-apr-25-2016-icici-direct-103001.html\">said in its report</a>. &#8220;Any disruption at CPL and/or RPLs can reduce or restrict sales and materially affect the business of the company. Any delay or interruption in transporting samples to CPL and or RPLs can also hurt the effectiveness of this business model.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company is also facing stiff competition from other domestic diagnostic laboratories, which are also vying for market share. India&#8217;s diagnostic industry is currently unorganised, with almost <a href=\"http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/lack-of-regulation-haunts-india-s-test-labs-114041400536_1.html\">90% of the market</a> controlled by local providers. Thyrocare&#8217;s competitors include Dr PathLabs, SRL Diagnostics, and Quest Diagnostics.</p>\n<p>Another concern is the growing advancement in medical technology.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The industry faces risk with changing technology and new product introductions,&#8221; HDFC Bank Investment Advisory Group <a href=\"https://www.hdfcbank.com/assets/pdf/privatebanking/Thyrocare-Technologies-IPO.pdf\">said in a report on April 25</a>. &#8220;Its advancement in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective tests that can be performed outside of a diagnostic laboratory, such as point-of-care tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices. The developments of such technology and its use by customers would reduce the demand for laboratory testing services and negatively affect revenues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Velumani, though, is ready to take on all the challenges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My entire life has been an upward slope,&#8221; Velumani said. &#8220;I am 57 now, and I haven&#8217;t lost any of the motivation I once had.&#8221;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=678790&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/dsc_3969-copy-2.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/dsc_3969-copy-2.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">A Velumani</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/aptio_panorama.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=640\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Thyrocare lab in Mumbai</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Apple just invested $1 billion in Didi, China&#8217;s Uber rival</title>\n\t\t<link>http://qz.com/683758/apple-just-invested-1-billion-in-didi-chinas-uber-rival/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 04:21:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Horwitz]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[China's Transition]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[didi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[didi chuxing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Didi Kuaidi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ride-hailing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[tncs]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[transportation network companies]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uber]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[uber china]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[uber in china]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/preview/683758</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The world&#8217;s most valuable company has finally placed a bet on the global ride-hailing wars\u2014and it&#8217;s not for Uber.

The deal was finalized at &#8220;lightning speed,&#8221; she says. Liu met Cook for the first time less than a month ago, in Cupertino, California</p>\n<p>The investment presents numerous opportunities for collaboration between the two companies. Apple rolled out <a href=\"http://qz.com/620241/apple-pay-is-live-in-china-but-getting-it-to-work-for-everyone-is-another-matter/\">Apple Pay in China</a> earlier this year, so it&#8217;s possible that the service will be placed in Didi&#8217;s app. Apple is also believed to be working on an autonomous vehicle of its own, so it&#8217;s possible the companies will work together to bring it to market. When asked about what specific new features or projects the investment would bring, Liu remained elusive.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&#8220;Tencent and Alibaba have been great supporters of Didi,&#8221; she said. &#8220;On payments and maps, in the future there will be more partnerships going forward. With Apple we are confident that with data science and technology the company will be pushed to a new level.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>The deal also marks Apple&#8217;s first official bet on a ride-hailing company. Didi is a member of an &#8220;anti-Uber alliance&#8221; that includes Lyft in the US, Grab in Southeast Asia, and Ola in India, as well as carmaker General Motors. It&#8217;s not unreasonable to speculate that Apple&#8217;s support will extend to these companies as well.</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s funding also comes just as the company faces new challenges in China. iPhone sales in the country are <a href=\"http://qz.com/670460/now-comes-the-hard-part-for-apple-in-china/\">not as stunning</a> as they once were, and the government recently forced it to <a href=\"http://qz.com/667570/apples-ibooks-and-itunes-movie-stores-have-been-shut-down-in-china/\">shut down its iBooks and iTunes services</a> in China.</p>\n<p>The investment marks a hurdle for Uber, which has not been as successful in China as it has in most other parts in the world. CEO Travis Kalanick has admitted to burning <a href=\"http://qz.com/618022/ubers-ceo-says-the-company-is-burning-1-billion-a-year-in-china/\">$1 billion a year in China</a>, and while reliable data is scarce, reports indicate that Didi occupies somewhere between 70% to 90% of the ride-hailing market in China. Apple&#8217;s investment in Didi certainly won&#8217;t help Uber&#8217;s position.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=683758&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/tim-cook-didi.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/tim-cook-didi.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">tim cook didi</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Donald Trump&#8217;s former butler allegedly wants US president Barack Obama to be lynched</title>\n\t\t<link>http://qz.com/683697/donald-trumps-former-butler-wants-us-president-barack-obama-to-be-lynched/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 03:03:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh Horwitz]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Barack Obama]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[david senecal]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[racism]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[trump butler]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[trump butler obama racist]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[trump butler obama shot]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[trump president]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/preview/683697</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A longtime assistant at a Donald Trump estate has posted some vitriolic comments about US president Barack Obama on Facebook.

On Wednesday, he wrote a missive stating Obama should have been &#8220;shot as an enemy agent&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To all my friends on FB, just a short note to you on our pus headed &#8220;president&#8221; !!!! This character who I refer to as zero (0) should have been taken out by our military and shot as an enemy agent in his first term !!!!! Instead he still remains in office doing every thing he can to gut the America we all know and love !!!!! Now comes Donald J Trump to put an end to the corruption in government !!!! The so called elite, who are nothing but common dog turds from your front lawn are shaking in their boots because there is a new Sheriff coming to town, and the end to their corruption of the American people (YOU) is at hand !!!! I cannot believe that a common murder is even allowed to run (killery clinton) OR that a commie like bernie is a also allowed to also run !!!! Come on America put your big boy pants on&#8212;this election you have a choice&#8212;GET YOUR ASS OUT AND VOTE !!!! Thank you !!!!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other posts are no more subtle. Mother Jones, which added Senecal on Facebook, captured snapshots of some of his other private posts. In addition to frequent photos of the confederate flag, Senecal has written posts calling the president a &#8220;muzzie,&#8221; a slur for Muslim, who needs to be lynched:</p>\n<p>From September 18, 2015:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our current &#8216;president&#8217; is a rotten filthy muzzie !!!!! Period !!!!!! He continues his war on Christians !!!!!! &#8230;zero is against the people of America !!!!!&#8221; Months earlier, he declared of Obama, &#8220;look at the number of goat screwing muzzies he is degrading our government with !!!!!&#8221; (One of Senecal&#8217;s Facebook associates replied, &#8220;We need to LYNCH that NIG &#8212; NOW!!&#8221;)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Senecal has also targeted Hillary Clinton, referring to her as &#8220;killery clinton.&#8221; From April 20, 2015:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stop the LYING BITCH OF BENGHAZI, NOW&#8212;killery clinton !!!!!!! She should be in prison awaiting hanging !!!!!!!!!!</p></blockquote>\n<p>A spokesperson for the Trump campaign told Mother Jones that Senecal &#8220;has not worked at the Mar-a-Lago for many years.&#8221; A lengthy New York Times profile from March reveals that Senecal indeed resigned from his duties as Trump&#8217;s butler after 2009, but has stayed at the estate <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/us/politics/donald-trump-butler-mar-a-lago.html?_r=0\">as its unofficial historian</a> (paywall). Unsurprisingly, Senecal is an enthusiastic supporter of Trump&#8217;s candidacy. Upon the announcement of Trump entering the race, Senecal wrote on Facebook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Today my employer and friend Donald J Trump announced he was running for the Office of President of the United States !!!!!! What an absolute thrill !!!!! NO ONE deserves to run for and be elected to this GREAT office, than Mr Trump !!!!! Can he handle the job, you bet your sweet ass he can !!!!!!

Lawrence</em>, a guided missile destroyer from the US Navy, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-usa-china-idUSKCN0Y10DM\">conducted a &#8220;freedom of navigation&#8221; operation</a> near the island. It deliberately sailed within 12 nautical miles of Fiery Cross Reef. If the US recognized the reef as China&#8217;s territory to begin with\u2014which it does not\u2014 that would be considered entering China&#8217;s territory.</p>\n<p>The problem is China has claimed, outrageously, that nearly the entire sea is it own territory. Considering the fact that some $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes through the strategic waterway every year, that&#8217;s a problem not just for the US, but any number of countries participating in the global economy. The US Navy&#8217;s operation was a reminder to China that the sea is open waters, despite any impromptu islands that might have been constructed of late.</p>\n<p>China bases its sea claim on a &#8220;nine-dash line&#8221; that it drew on a map after World War 2. Never mind that the line conflicts with international norms and overlapping claims by nearby nations, including the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia, nations whose coasts are much closer to the disputed sea than China&#8217;s.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-533796\" class=\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-large\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/spratly-exercise1.png?w=1024\" data-retina=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/spratly-exercise1.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" title=\"Mind the nine-dash line.\"/><figcaption class=\"inline-image-caption\"><i class=\"icon-camera\"></i>Mind the nine-dash line.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Many observers feel it&#8217;s ridiculous to base real-world claims on such a map.

Passing through it each year, he noted, is almost 60% of Japan\u2019s and Taiwan\u2019s energy supplies, and 80% of China\u2019s crude oil imports.</p>\n<p>Were a conflict involving these or other nations to break out, control of the sea could give Beijing a distinct advantage in securing\u2014or blocking\u2014the energy needed to power a war machine. The most critical resource <a href=\"http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/O/i/Oil.htm\">that Japan lacked</a> in World War 2 was oil\u2014a key history lesson surely not lost on China&#8217;s military strategists. (The sea is full of its own vast untapped reserves of oil and natural gas, too.)</p>\n<p>To acquire the sea&#8217;s strategic advantage, though, China first needs to establish control over the waterway. That needs to be done step by step. The process might go something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make the sea claim.</li>\n<li>Create outposts in the sea, and work toward turning them into military bases. At this stage, you might want to <a href=\"http://qz.com/433630/china-says-it-is-building-islands-and-airstrips-in-the-south-china-sea-for-better-weather-forecasts/\">deny the military bit</a>.</li>\n<li>Express outrage if anyone goes near those outposts. Over time, establish a pattern of being repeatedly provoked, despite your <a href=\"http://qz.com/533756/the-us-just-challenged-china-in-the-south-china-sea-and-nothing-happened/\">patient warnings</a>. Your outposts aren&#8217;t quite military bases yet anyway, so this is a good use of your time in the meantime.</li>\n<li>As your outposts <a href=\"http://qz.com/623496/beijing-sent-fighter-jets-to-a-disputed-island-in-the-south-china-sea/\">get closer</a> to becoming real military bases, feel free to grow <a href=\"http://qz.com/619191/talking-about-our-new-missiles-is-making-the-south-china-sea-unsafe-beijing-says/\">more strident</a> in your responses to the &#8220;provocations.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Once your military infrastructure is fully up to speed, you&#8217;re ready for war\u2014you even have a track record of provocations to point to for justification! Of course you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to start a conflict, but it&#8217;s nice to know you <em>can</em> at any time\u2014and feel justified about it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>China isn&#8217;t just relying on its military. The country has a massive fishing fleet, and by far the world&#8217;s largest fish industry. For years Beijing has been paying fishing boats to operate near its disputed outposts in the sea, even if they don&#8217;t catch much in the area. It certainly helps appearances.</p>\n<p>The fishing fleet needs to expand outward because through over-fishing it has nearly depleted the fishing stock near China&#8217;s own shores. So it increasingly needs to fish in the exclusive economic zones of other nations, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/southchinasea-china-fishingboats-repeat-idUSL3N17Y05O\">as it is doing</a>. By establishing outposts and more control over the sea, China&#8217;s military <a href=\"http://qz.com/653928/when-chinas-far-flung-fishing-fleet-trespasses-in-other-nations-waters-beijing-has-its-back/\">can better support</a> the fleet&#8217;s forays into distant or contested waters.</p>\n<p>Those fishing forays often involve confrontations with foreign coastguards or navies. (Hey, more potential provocations!) With other nations responding by <a href=\"http://qz.com/575189/indonesia-will-send-fighter-jets-to-its-pearl-harbor-in-the-south-china-sea/\">beefing up their maritime forces</a> and monitoring technologies\u2014<a href=\"http://qz.com/672122/indonesia-has-a-new-weapon-against-illegal-fishing-nano-satellites/\">networked nano-satellites</a>, in the case of Indonesia\u2014more such confrontations can be expected in the future.</p>\n<p>Beijing has also whipped up patriotic feelings in the Chinese population about the sea being the nation&#8217;s birthright. A warship recently took a song-and-dance troupe on a tour of various disputed outposts in the reef. It started at Fiery Cross Reef, where celebrity singer Song Zuying <a href=\"http://qz.com/677483/beijing-is-using-the-theme-song-from-titanic-to-bolster-its-claims-in-the-south-china-sea/\">gave a stirring rendition</a> of a song called \u201cOde to the South Sea Defenders.&#8221;</p>\n<p>State media coverage of the event included an interview with a navy officer from the audience telling CCTV after the performance, &#8220;<span class=\"s1\">We&#8217;ll definitely not lose at our hands an inch of the territories our ancestors left us.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/S3wbihh9YC4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>The TV coverage offered glimpses into just how impressively far along the island construction has come in a short time. The island even has runways suitable for fighter jets. This suggests China is well into Step 4 above. And indeed, it&#8217;s grown increasingly stern in its responses to &#8220;provocations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When a US Navy warship passed by the Spratlys <a href=\"http://qz.com/533756/the-us-just-challenged-china-in-the-south-china-sea-and-nothing-happened/\">last October</a>, China simply warned it against acting irresponsibly. But this week when another warship did the same thing, it sent fighter jets scrambling and shadowed the US ship with its own warships\u2014thanks in part to the convenient military base nearby.</p>\n<p>Even talking about China&#8217;s activities in the sea\u2014in <em>diplomatic settings</em>\u2014<a href=\"http://qz.com/619191/talking-about-our-new-missiles-is-making-the-south-china-sea-unsafe-beijing-says/\">now draws ire</a> from Beijing. In April it <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/1935084/south-china-sea-warning-looms-over-g7-summit\">warned G7 leaders</a> meeting in Japan to not discuss the matter at all, and then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/12/south-china-sea-beijing-tells-g7-foreign-ministers-to-keep-out-of-territorial-dispute\">said it was &#8220;strongly dissatisfied&#8221;</a> after they did anyway.</p>\n<p>Last week, one Chinese diplomat warned that criticism of China&#8217;s actions in the sea would <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-idUSKCN0XX0BG\">rebound like a coiled spring</a>. If comments are &#8220;aimed at putting pressure on China or blackening its name, then you can view it like a spring, which has an applied force and a counterforce. The more the pressure, the greater the reaction,&#8221; said Ouyang Yujing, director-general of the foreign ministry&#8217;s department of boundary and ocean affairs.</p>\n<p>In other words, Beijing is pressing its outrageous claims in the South China, and will take any opposition as a reason to press them even harder.</p>\n<p>One US commander is having none of it. Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr., in charge of military operations in the Asia-Pacific region, <a href=\"http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/world/asia/us-admiral-harry-harris.html?referer=https://t.co/DfbPkPiX8L\">says China is &#8220;clearly militarizing</a>&#8221; (paywall) in the sea. \u201cYou\u2019d have to believe in a flat earth to think otherwise,\u201d he said in one appearance before Congress.</p>\n<p>China knows it can&#8217;t go it alone, though, and it can muster some diplomatic chumminess when merited.

The court was established in 1899 and has settled numerous maritime disputes between nations. China has refused to recognize its authority\u2014probably because it knows it doesn&#8217;t have much of a case for its claim. The court is widely expected to rule in the Philippines&#8217; favor.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a neat bit of logic, China&#8217;s defense ministry used this week&#8217;s US freedom of navigation operation to justify its militarization of the Spratly\u2014or what it calls the Nansha\u2014islands. The operation &#8220;again proves that China&#8217;s construction of defensive facilities on the relevant reefs in the Nansha islands is completely reasonable and totally necessary,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-usa-china-idUSKCN0Y10DM\">its defense ministry said</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its own actions, China has been provoked, and is building a case to respond even more outrageously\u2014now or in the future.</p>\n<p><em>We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=680123&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ouyang-yujing-chinas-director-general-of-the-department-of-boundary-and-ocean-affairs-e1462959708979.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ouyang-yujing-chinas-director-general-of-the-department-of-boundary-and-ocean-affairs-e1462959708979.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Ouyang Yujing, China&#039;s director-general of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, speaks at a briefing on China&#039;s stance on the South China Sea, in Beijing</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/unclos-territory-colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=320\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">UNCLOS territorial jurisdictions.</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/spratly-exercise1.png?w=940\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Mind the nine-dash line.</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/photograph-from-jurisdictional-hearing-july-2015.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=320\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Albert F. del Rosario\u2014the Philippines&#039; foreign affairs secretary\u2014at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in July 2015.</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Drowning is a leading killer of Chinese youths</title>\n\t\t<link>http://qz.com/682625/drowning-is-a-leading-killer-of-chinese-youths/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:19:01 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Zheping Huang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[China's Transition]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[adolescent health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[China]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[death]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[drowning]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Indonesia]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lancet Youth]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[road injuries]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[rural areas in China]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Russia]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[self-harm]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[suicide]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[WHO]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[youth]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/preview/682625</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Water is second only to cars in claiming young people&#8217;s lives in China, a recent study finds.

In 2013, drowning was the number one cause of death for Chinese aged 10 to 14, with 5,526 such deaths reported that year. Overall, it killed 14,448 Chinese young people aged 10 to 24 in 2013, second only to road injuries.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"HJVWb6-M\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_HJVWb6-M.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>Globally, drowning accounted for 6.7% of deaths for children aged 10 to 14 in 2013, but 33% in China.

Over the past few months, the fundraising effort has been aimed at venture capital firms focused on bitcoin and blockchain.</p>\n<p>Szabo is perhaps best known as the father of &#8220;smart contracts,&#8221; blockchain-based agreements that execute automatically.
