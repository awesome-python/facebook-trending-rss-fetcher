Ted Cruz</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Drew Angerer / Getty Images</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; After a presidential campaign that saw him go from the most hated man in the Senate to last-ditch standard bearer for the establishment&rsquo;s Never Trump movement, Ted Cruz returned to the Senate this week with a choice to make.</p><p>Does he return to his monkey wrench ways, which made him a conservative hero in the Senate, and burn the few bridges to his colleagues he built in the waning days of his failed bid? Or, does he find ways to build upon those relationships, hit the road to support House and Senate candidates, and nurture a persona as a party uniter?</p><p>Cruz himself has given little indication of what he&rsquo;s planning. But some people close to him argue if he can use his national profile to build good will with Republican senators over the next few years, he could be well positioned to be the man who can unite the firebrand and establishment wings of the GOP come 2020.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a big moment for him,&rdquo; said one member of Cruz&rsquo;s inner circle. &ldquo;He has a little bit of breathing room in terms of time to figure it out. A lot of it will impact how he treats the Senate races. A lot of people will be watching. Does he go out and campaign for these other senators, raise money for them? Is he really out there pounding the pavement in order to get them across the finish line?&rdquo;</p><p>Tuesday marked one week since Cruz dropped out of the race, and it was the day Cruz returned to the Senate. Surrounded by a thick pack of reporters outside his office in the Russell building, Cruz took a few questions and didn&rsquo;t seem prepared to declare a detente with the party that spurned, and then begrudgingly sort of embraced him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to continue fighting for the American people,&rdquo; Cruz said. &ldquo;And if fighting for the American people makes you an outsider in the Senate, then I will happily remain an outsider.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite his rhetorical swagger &mdash; which in the past incensed his colleagues and was one of the key reasons for the near universal dislike for the Texas Republican &mdash; even his most vocal critics, at least for now, appear willing to let bygones be bygones.</p><p>\"You come out of this thing, let&#39;s say we lost the White House, I hope we can all focus on a Republican Party that&#39;s got a place for all of us,&rdquo; said Sen. Lindsey Graham, who ran for president himself for a time, then endorsed Jeb Bush, then switched his endorsement to Cruz after Bush dropped out. &ldquo;We had just a bitter struggle in the party about our differences. I think our differences are nuanced, tactical more than strategic. And after all this mess is over, the one thing I hope for is that the party can focus on what we have in common and accept our differences.\"</p><p>That&rsquo;s a remarkable turnaround from this winter, when Graham described the choice between Cruz and Donald Trump as akin to that between being shot and poisoned.</p><p>Asked if he would support Cruz again if Cruz ran in 2020, Graham laughed. &ldquo;I don&#39;t know about that,&rdquo; he said. \"I supported him this time because I thought he was the best alternative to Donald Trump, and he ran a hell of campaign of which he should be proud of.\"</p><p>Cruz campaigned on his unpopularity in the Senate, casting himself as the ultimate Washington outsider breaking the rules in the clubby, out-of-touch atmosphere of the upper chamber. The Senate, in Cruz&rsquo;s parlance, was part of the &ldquo;Washington Cartel&rdquo; he railed against. But he rarely talked about the apogee of this: his role in the government shutdown of 2013. And the fact that his colleagues never truly threw their weight behind him despite his being the last man standing could, some think, inspire Cruz to build more bridges, especially this year when some of his colleagues&rsquo; re-election chances are directly imperiled by Trump.</p><p>Former Bush administration deputy national security adviser Elliott Abrams, who was one of Cruz&rsquo;s national security advisers, also encouraged Cruz to do more work for the party.</p><p>&ldquo;He will spend the next few years I assume doing a lot of appearances around the country and I think the best way for him to combat this constant series of hits, particularly from other Republican senators, is just to make himself better known,&rdquo; Abrams said, suggesting Cruz &ldquo;get around the country making speeches for Republican state parties, and for candidates running for [the] House and Senate who invite him.&rdquo;</p><p>Cruz is 45 and is widely assumed to be planning on running again in 2020, if Trump loses this general election. His rhetoric at the end of his campaign regarding Trump seemed geared towards that end. Speaking to reporters on the final day of his campaign, Cruz unloaded on Trump, using language that&rsquo;s hard to take back &mdash; &ldquo;amoral,&rdquo; &ldquo;pathological liar,&rdquo; &ldquo;serial philanderer.&rdquo; And so far, unlike Marco Rubio who made similarly pointed statements, Cruz has withheld his endorsement.</p><p>&ldquo;My guess is that he would continue in the Senate pursuing a thoughtful conservative agenda and role and if Trump flames out again, that press conference may end up being prophetic &mdash; &lsquo;I tried to warn you what&rsquo;s going to happen,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Rick Tyler, Cruz&rsquo;s former campaign spokesman. &ldquo;Assuming that [Trump] does very poorly against Hillary Clinton and implodes the ticket and we lose seats all over the place, I absolutely think people will look to Cruz.&rdquo;</p><p>But a lot depends on how the next few years go for Cruz, and for the party itself.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably done more for party unity this year than almost anyone else,&rdquo; said Kellyanne Conway, who ran the main pro-Cruz super PACs. After Cruz dropped out, Conway announced she will now support Trump as the nominee. &ldquo;He made a graceful exit from the race.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The rise of Donald Trump will give people a second look at Ted Cruz,&rdquo; Conway said.</p><p>Victoria Coates, Cruz&rsquo;s top national security adviser, said Cruz was focused on getting back to work in the Senate. &ldquo;In terms of national security there is a real platform in the senate he is extremely well poised to take advantage of,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Coates noted Cruz&rsquo;s winning the Texas primary by a large margin. &ldquo;I think he just got a huge vote of confidence from his home state and he wants to repay that by doing his job,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Coates noted Cruz&rsquo;s tense relationship with his colleagues but said it had never been personal; and on the topic of whether Cruz will campaign for fellow Republicans up for re-election, Coates said &ldquo;I think you could probably surmise from what he did in 2014 which is, &lsquo;if people want me I&rsquo;ll come, if they want me to stay away I&rsquo;ll stay away.&rsquo; Certainly from his perspective as a senator keeping as many seats as we can in the senate is a priority.&rdquo;</p><p>But some doubt that Cruz did enough to win people over to his cause during the campaign, and indeed, many in his party withheld their endorsement or endorsed Trump over him even though he was the last viable non-Trump option.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just not a guy who can reach across and bring people on board,&rdquo; said one anti-Trump Republican strategist. \"He did not go out of his way to try and bring people together.\"</p><p>\"I figure he just stays the course\" for 2020, the strategist said. \"I think he only has one gear.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Cruz himself appeared to already be looking past the immediate future.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve withdrawn from the campaign, it&rsquo;s in the hands of the voters,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If circumstances change we will always assess changed circumstances. I appreciate the eagerness and excitement of all the folks in the media to see me back in the ring, but you may have to wait a little longer.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Rosie Gray</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/can-ted-cruz-make-friends-influence-people-and-run-for-presi</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:39:14 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">He could look like a prophet, and the 2020 nominee &#x2014; &#x22;if Trump flames out.&#x22;</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">rosiegray</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/22/campaign_images/webdr04/can-ted-cruz-make-friends-influence-people-and-ru-2-32570-1463107151-12.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n  <media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/18/enhanced/webdr07/enhanced-buzz-13098-1463093529-7.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;480&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sen.

And after all this mess is over, the one thing I hope for is that the party can focus on what we have in common and accept our differences.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;That&#x26;rsquo;s a remarkable turnaround from this winter, when Graham described the choice between Cruz and Donald Trump as akin to that between being shot and poisoned.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Asked if he would support Cruz again if Cruz ran in 2020, Graham laughed. &#x26;ldquo;I don&#x26;#39;t know about that,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x22;I supported him this time because I thought he was the best alternative to Donald Trump, and he ran a hell of campaign of which he should be proud of.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Cruz campaigned on his unpopularity in the Senate, casting himself as the ultimate Washington outsider breaking the rules in the clubby, out-of-touch atmosphere of the upper chamber. The Senate, in Cruz&#x26;rsquo;s parlance, was part of the &#x26;ldquo;Washington Cartel&#x26;rdquo; he railed against. But he rarely talked about the apogee of this: his role in the government shutdown of 2013. And the fact that his colleagues never truly threw their weight behind him despite his being the last man standing could, some think, inspire Cruz to build more bridges, especially this year when some of his colleagues&#x26;rsquo; re-election chances are directly imperiled by Trump.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Former Bush administration deputy national security adviser Elliott Abrams, who was one of Cruz&#x26;rsquo;s national security advisers, also encouraged Cruz to do more work for the party.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;He will spend the next few years I assume doing a lot of appearances around the country and I think the best way for him to combat this constant series of hits, particularly from other Republican senators, is just to make himself better known,&#x26;rdquo; Abrams said, suggesting Cruz &#x26;ldquo;get around the country making speeches for Republican state parties, and for candidates running for [the] House and Senate who invite him.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Cruz is 45 and is widely assumed to be planning on running again in 2020, if Trump loses this general election. His rhetoric at the end of his campaign regarding Trump seemed geared towards that end. Speaking to reporters on the final day of his campaign, Cruz unloaded on Trump, using language that&#x26;rsquo;s hard to take back &#x26;mdash; &#x26;ldquo;amoral,&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;ldquo;pathological liar,&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;ldquo;serial philanderer.&#x26;rdquo; And so far, unlike Marco Rubio who made similarly pointed statements, Cruz has withheld his endorsement.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;My guess is that he would continue in the Senate pursuing a thoughtful conservative agenda and role and if Trump flames out again, that press conference may end up being prophetic &#x26;mdash; &#x26;lsquo;I tried to warn you what&#x26;rsquo;s going to happen,&#x26;rsquo;&#x26;rdquo; said Rick Tyler, Cruz&#x26;rsquo;s former campaign spokesman. &#x26;ldquo;Assuming that [Trump] does very poorly against Hillary Clinton and implodes the ticket and we lose seats all over the place, I absolutely think people will look to Cruz.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But a lot depends on how the next few years go for Cruz, and for the party itself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;He&#x26;rsquo;s probably done more for party unity this year than almost anyone else,&#x26;rdquo; said Kellyanne Conway, who ran the main pro-Cruz super PACs. After Cruz dropped out, Conway announced she will now support Trump as the nominee. &#x26;ldquo;He made a graceful exit from the race.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;The rise of Donald Trump will give people a second look at Ted Cruz,&#x26;rdquo; Conway said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Victoria Coates, Cruz&#x26;rsquo;s top national security adviser, said Cruz was focused on getting back to work in the Senate. &#x26;ldquo;In terms of national security there is a real platform in the senate he is extremely well poised to take advantage of,&#x26;rdquo; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Coates noted Cruz&#x26;rsquo;s winning the Texas primary by a large margin. &#x26;ldquo;I think he just got a huge vote of confidence from his home state and he wants to repay that by doing his job,&#x26;rdquo; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Coates noted Cruz&#x26;rsquo;s tense relationship with his colleagues but said it had never been personal; and on the topic of whether Cruz will campaign for fellow Republicans up for re-election, Coates said &#x26;ldquo;I think you could probably surmise from what he did in 2014 which is, &#x26;lsquo;if people want me I&#x26;rsquo;ll come, if they want me to stay away I&#x26;rsquo;ll stay away.&#x26;rsquo; Certainly from his perspective as a senator keeping as many seats as we can in the senate is a priority.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But some doubt that Cruz did enough to win people over to his cause during the campaign, and indeed, many in his party withheld their endorsement or endorsed Trump over him even though he was the last viable non-Trump option.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;He&#x26;rsquo;s just not a guy who can reach across and bring people on board,&#x26;rdquo; said one anti-Trump Republican strategist. &#x22;He did not go out of his way to try and bring people together.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;I figure he just stays the course&#x22; for 2020, the strategist said. &#x22;I think he only has one gear.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On Tuesday, Cruz himself appeared to already be looking past the immediate future.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;We&#x26;rsquo;ve withdrawn from the campaign, it&#x26;rsquo;s in the hands of the voters,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x26;ldquo;If circumstances change we will always assess changed circumstances. I appreciate the eagerness and excitement of all the folks in the media to see me back in the ring, but you may have to wait a little longer.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Trump Once Mocked How Feminists Would Respond To His Comments Degrading Women</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-once-mocked-how-feminists-would-respond-to-his-degradi?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>&#8220;What do you think of the women&#8217;s liberation movement.

Deb Fischer, who also attended the meeting, declined to disclose details and said it wasn&#x26;#39;t Trump&#x26;#39;s rhetoric that give her pause. &#x22;What gives me pause is that we&#x26;#39;ll have a continuation of four more years of this administration, and that&#x26;#39;s what we&#x26;#39;ll get with Hillary Clinton,&#x22; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;We brought up different things that are of concern to us and to the people we represent,&#x22; she said of the meeting. &#x22;[Trump] listened. He listened well. We had a great discussion.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-9729-1463085040-18.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;480&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Drew Angerer / Getty Images&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Senator Jeff Flake, who does not support Trump, said senators who attended the meeting characterized it as &#x22;positive&#x22; during a Republican caucus lunch.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sen. Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the campaign after losing his home state of Florida to Trump, said he thought his party were all hoping to unite. &#x22;I think that&#x26;#39;s what they&#x26;#39;re all desiring to do,&#x22; Rubio told reporters. &#x22;Everyone&#x26;#39;s gonna kind of make their own decision on this. And everyone&#x26;#39;s gonna make it at a different time.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rubio downplayed the potential impact Trump could have on down-ballot candidates, something that worries many Republicans who are concerned about keeping their majorities on the House and Senate.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;I don&#x26;#39;t know how that&#x26;#39;s going to play out,&#x22; Rubio said. &#x22;In the end, candidates are going to have to make their own case for why they should be re-elected or elected. The only issue in a presidential year is how much attention can you get for your message when it&#x26;#39;s all being eaten up by a presidential race, but that happens every four years.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Though Rubio became increasingly harsh on Trump near the end of his campaign, suggesting that Trump had wet himself during a debate and saying he shouldn&#x26;#39;t have access to the nuclear codes, Rubio last week re-affirmed that he will support the Republican nominee -- meaning Trump.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Although Trump received a seemingly warm reception from lawmakers, he was greeted by protesters carrying &#x22;RIP GOP&#x22; and &#x22;Islamophobia is UnAmerican&#x22; signs and repeated chants of &#x22;Racists, sexists not ok. Donald Trump go away.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;One of the protesters wore a paper mache Trump head and carried bags with dollar signs on them, as he mocked some of real estate mogul&#x26;#39;s policies. A group of young undocumented immigrants also delivered a cardboard coffin to RNC staffers.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Trump did not stop to speak to reporters as he made his way around Capitol Hill in a black SUV.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He waved from his car as he left and later tweeted: &#x22;Things working out really well&#x26;#33;&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"460\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/16/enhanced/webdr03/enhanced-buzz-13882-1463084381-19.jpg\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Donald Trump Says Muslim Ban Was &#x22;Just A Suggestion&#x22;</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonwells/donald-trump-was-jk-on-muslim-ban?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/14/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-mid-10637-1463076218-12.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"481\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Donald Trump waves as he arrives for a meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Andrew Harnik / AP</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Donald Trump this week said his previous call for a \"total and complete\" ban on Muslims entering the U.S. was \"just a suggestion.\"</p><p>\"We have a serious problem, it&rsquo;s a temporary ban, it hasn&rsquo;t been called for yet, nobody&rsquo;s done it, this is just a suggestion until we find out what&rsquo;s going on,\" he said in <a href=\"https://radio.foxnews.com/2016/05/11/kilmeades-wide-ranging-interview-w-donald-trump-on-his-vp-shortlist-joe-biden-newly-elected-london-mayor-megyn-kellys-special-more/\">an interview</a> Wednesday with Fox Radio&#39;s <i>Kilmeade &amp; Friends.</i></p><p>In December, however, Trump called for a \"complete shutdown\" on Muslim visitors entering the U.S. in a speech and statements issued <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration\">by his campaign.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Donald J.

Pachon is joining former Media Matters staffer Jessica Torres, who is already working with the convention committee.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The effort to beef up on the Latino communications side represents a new front in the Democratic diversity effort, with a Hispanic media roundtable on Thursday with Rev. Leah D. Daughtry, CEO of the DNCC, being seen as an opportunity to be more inclusive and build relationships earlier in the process than ever before.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;The Latino vote is here to stay, and Democrats are reflecting that in their convention,&#x26;rdquo; Rocha said, whose experience dates back to the 1996 convention in Chicago, when at 25, he was the youngest elected delegate from Texas to attend.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;Twenty years later, I&#x26;#39;m a vendor to the convention, it shows the party&#x26;#39;s growth,&#x22; he said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The efforts to build a robust Latino communications team are something new for Democrats, who haven&#x26;#39;t put a similar focus into past conventions.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;A decade ago, it&#x26;#39;s something people would have thought of a week out,&#x22; Parra said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Latinos Struggle To Compete With Black Businesses For Democratic Convention Dollars</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/latinos-struggle-to-compete-with-black-businesses-for-democr?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\t\n\n\t \n\t\t  <iframe src=\"https://instagram.com/p/BFMam9_sBb-/embed/\" height=\"710\" width=\"612\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>\n\t  \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://instagram.com/p/BFMam9_sBb-/#author_demconvention\">Instagram: @demconvention</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>While the Democratic National Convention has made strides in awarding more contracts to minority owned businesses since 2012, Hispanic businesses are still struggling to find themselves on equal footing with black contractors, two months before Democrats descend on Philadelphia on July 25.</p><p>The convention committee (DNCC) set a more aggressive goal than it did in 2012: to dole out 35% of it&rsquo;s contracts to diverse contractors &mdash; including businesses led by women, members of the LGBT community, and veterans, as well as organizations led by people with disabilities.</p><p>So far, Democrats have made real progress towards that goal: five of the six major convention contracts have been given to diverse businesses, while six of the host committee&rsquo;s seven contracts have gone to diverse firms.</p><p>But significant challenges remain, particularly for Latino companies, which have lagged behind their black counterparts. &ldquo;Minority contracting has always done a shitty job of pitting black and Latino contractors against each other,&rdquo; a longtime Democrat acknowledged.</p><p>Indeed, while two black businesses have scored lucrative $1 million contracts on the convention side, only one Latino company has received a contract at that level from the host committee.</p><p>One of the key issues, Democrats said, has been the relative lack of well-connected Latino businesses compared to black businesses.

He&#39;s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren&#39;t captured.\"</p>\n\n<p>Appearing on the <i>Imus in the Morning</i>, Trump was asked if he would apologize to veterans, as McCain has recently requested. </p>\n\n<p>\"Well I&#39;ve actually done that, Don,\" Trump replied. \"You know frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero. Also, heroes are people that are, you know, whether they get caught or don&#39;t get caught &mdash; they&#39;re all heroes as far as I&#39;m concerned. And that&#39;s the way it should be.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"So do you regret saying that?\" asked Imus.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don&#39;t, you know &mdash; I like not to regret anything,\" Trump said. \"You do things and you say things.

You know after I said that, my poll numbers went up seven points.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"You understand that, I mean, some people liked what I said,\" added Trump. \"I like John McCain, in my eyes John McCain is a hero.

John McCain, who was captured and held prisoner during the Vietnam War, &#x22;not a war hero.&#x22;\n\nLast July, Trump said of McCain: &#x22;He&#x27;s not a war hero. He&#x27;s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren&#x27;t captured.&#x22;\n\nAppearing on the &#x3C;i&#x3E;Imus in the Morning&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, Trump was asked if he would apologize to veterans, as McCain has recently requested. \n\n&#x22;Well I&#x27;ve actually done that, Don,&#x22; Trump replied. &#x22;You know frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero. Also, heroes are people that are, you know, whether they get caught or don&#x27;t get caught &#x2014; they&#x27;re all heroes as far as I&#x27;m concerned. And that&#x27;s the way it should be.&#x22;\n\n&#x22;So do you regret saying that?&#x22; asked Imus.\n\n&#x22;I don&#x27;t, you know &#x2014; I like not to regret anything,&#x22; Trump said. &#x22;You do things and you say things. And what I said, frankly, is what I said. And some people like what I said, if you want to know the truth. There are many people that like what I said. You know after I said that, my poll numbers went up seven points.&#x22;\n\n&#x22;You understand that, I mean, some people liked what I said,&#x22; added Trump. &#x22;I like John McCain, in my eyes John McCain is a hero. John McCain&#x27;s a good guy.&#x22; \n\nImus said someone like Trump, who got multiple Vietnam War draft deferments, shouldn&#x27;t be criticizing someone like McCain.\n\n&#x22;I understand that.

(Or as Clinton put it last week, to &ldquo;fight for you and your families every day &ndash; whether you vote for me or not.&rdquo;)</p><p>At other points, however, the effort reflected a far more complex reality behind that promise: a country that has changed significantly since Bill Clinton campaigned in communities like Williamson, a candidate who doesn&rsquo;t lend herself to the role of unifier, and a general election between two of history&rsquo;s least popular likely nominees.</p><p>As she traveled through Appalachia, a swath of coal country where Trump has found many of his most ardent supporters, Clinton encountered voters set in rigid opposition to her presence. In Kentucky, as Clinton led a discussion with steel workers, protesters shouted from across the street: &ldquo;<i>Nobody wants you here&#33; Go home&#33;</i>&rdquo; In southeastern Ohio, as she left a speech, two men stood arms raised, each flashing a middle finger. And in Williamson, W.Va., at a small forum on the coal community, one of the participants <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/clinton-deals-face-to-face-with-deep-opposition-in-coal-coun\">challenged</a> Clinton on a comment she made about putting miners out of work.</p><p>Even Bill Clinton, who once connected deeply with white working-class families in states like West Virginia, was met with some resistance as he campaigned there this month. For many in the region, the former president acknowledged, there was perhaps little to be done to sway the vote. But for the campaign, he said, the swing through West Virginia was a significant symbolic gesture, not a last-ditch bid to win Tuesday&rsquo;s primary.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, here&rsquo;s the deal. That wasn&rsquo;t about getting votes, for her or for me,&rdquo; Bill Clinton said, stopping to answer questions after a recent campaign event in California.</p><p>&ldquo;She was trying to make the point: &lsquo;Vote however you&rsquo;re determined to vote, but I don&rsquo;t think we can leave anybody behind,&rsquo;&rdquo; the former president said. &ldquo;That was about saying, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how you vote. Every American deserves a chance to get back into an economy where there is a stable middle class and there is upward mobility.&rdquo;</p><p>The trip through West Virginia marked the effective start of Clinton&rsquo;s general election bid, kicking off a string of other small roundtable discussions across Virginia and Kentucky this week, fashioned in the style of the so-called &ldquo;listening tours&rdquo; that the former U.S. senator has historically used to begin her campaigns. The events feature about a dozen participants and play out as a mix of policy talk, heavy on details, and of personal stories, often of setback and hardships, from the voters at the table.</p><p>To start a general election with events like these in the heart of Trump country, Clinton aides argue, reflects an implicit contrast with the presumptive GOP nominee.</p><p>&ldquo;What we want to communicate in these weeks is that she is the one that is able to best unify the country,&rdquo; said Brian Fallon, the campaign&rsquo;s national press secretary.</p><p>&ldquo;She is going to be the one that will reach out &mdash; to not try to divide Americans against each other, but bring people together even if they don&rsquo;t start off supporting her. We especially want to do that in areas that frequently get overlooked,&rdquo; Fallon said, noting that Clinton will continue to &ldquo;highlight those areas&rdquo; as she travels to battleground states while also competing in the remaining Democratic primaries and caucuses.</p><p>One of her biggest backers in West Virginia, Sen. Joe Manchin, told reporters last week that Clinton&rsquo;s advisers had argued the trip. &ldquo;All of her people said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go somewhere else, let&rsquo;s not go there.&rsquo; I heard all of it.&rdquo; The idea behind the of tour, Manchin said, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t from the standpoint of thinking, we&rsquo;re gonna turn these people around.&rdquo;</p><p>Aides acknowledge that Clinton, who has been a polarizing figure in national politics for more than two decades and is now nearly as unpopular with Americans as the GOP frontrunner, may seem like an improbable figure when it comes to unifying a badly splintered country and appealing to the white working-class voters who identify with Trump and Bernie Sanders. (On Tuesday, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/10/a-new-poll-shows-trump-beating-clinton-in-ohio-but-it-assumes-a-pretty-white-electorate/\">Quinnipiac poll</a> with a large share of white voters sampled showed Clinton and Trump performing evenly in three key swing states.)</p><p>Campaign officials have argued that Clinton&rsquo;s wins in Ohio and New York, for instance, show she can pick up support from that slice of the electorate, expanding on a coalition of older voters, women, and people of color. Still, as she campaigned ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s primary, the protests that followed her across Appalachia revealed a larger shift among the same voters who supported Clinton over Barack Obama in 2008 and identified with her husband&rsquo;s campaigns, but now flock to Trump&rsquo;s unlikely brand of populism.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened,&rdquo; Bill Clinton reasoned, &ldquo;is most of these people are making the same or less money than the last day I was president. And there&rsquo;s been a big loss of jobs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the people &mdash; there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with them. They just want to work,&rdquo; the former president said, echoing the words of protesters like Branham, the woman who stood outside Clinton&#39;s campaign event in downtown Williamson. &ldquo;They want a future. I think that you can&rsquo;t blame &rsquo;em for being mad. They feel everybody has abandoned them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Basically, our state has changed,&rdquo; Manchin said.</p><p>He predicted that Trump&#39;s campaign would be able to draw a &ldquo;tremendous number&rdquo; of new voters to the polls in less diverse states. &ldquo;These are all good people, hard-working people, God-fearing people&hellip; I&rsquo;ve known &#39;em all my life, the people down there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re hurt,&rdquo; Manchin said.</p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Ruby Cramer</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/clinton-faces-hard-reality-of-unity-promise-in-trump-country</guid>\n<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 22:36:06 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">Hillary Clinton lost to Bernie Sanders in West Virginia, where she began her general election bid with a sweeping symbolic gesture but was met with some resistance. &#x201C;Look, here&#x2019;s the deal.

Joe Manchin, told reporters last week that Clinton&#x26;rsquo;s advisers had argued the trip. &#x26;ldquo;All of her people said, &#x26;lsquo;Let&#x26;rsquo;s go somewhere else, let&#x26;rsquo;s not go there.&#x26;rsquo; I heard all of it.&#x26;rdquo; The idea behind the of tour, Manchin said, &#x26;ldquo;wasn&#x26;rsquo;t from the standpoint of thinking, we&#x26;rsquo;re gonna turn these people around.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Aides acknowledge that Clinton, who has been a polarizing figure in national politics for more than two decades and is now nearly as unpopular with Americans as the GOP frontrunner, may seem like an improbable figure when it comes to unifying a badly splintered country and appealing to the white working-class voters who identify with Trump and Bernie Sanders. (On Tuesday, a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/10/a-new-poll-shows-trump-beating-clinton-in-ohio-but-it-assumes-a-pretty-white-electorate/&#x22;&#x3E;Quinnipiac poll&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with a large share of white voters sampled showed Clinton and Trump performing evenly in three key swing states.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Campaign officials have argued that Clinton&#x26;rsquo;s wins in Ohio and New York, for instance, show she can pick up support from that slice of the electorate, expanding on a coalition of older voters, women, and people of color. Still, as she campaigned ahead of Tuesday&#x26;rsquo;s primary, the protests that followed her across Appalachia revealed a larger shift among the same voters who supported Clinton over Barack Obama in 2008 and identified with her husband&#x26;rsquo;s campaigns, but now flock to Trump&#x26;rsquo;s unlikely brand of populism.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;What happened,&#x26;rdquo; Bill Clinton reasoned, &#x26;ldquo;is most of these people are making the same or less money than the last day I was president. And there&#x26;rsquo;s been a big loss of jobs.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;But the people &#x26;mdash; there&#x26;rsquo;s nothing wrong with them. They just want to work,&#x26;rdquo; the former president said, echoing the words of protesters like Branham, the woman who stood outside Clinton&#x26;#39;s campaign event in downtown Williamson. &#x26;ldquo;They want a future. I think that you can&#x26;rsquo;t blame &#x26;rsquo;em for being mad. They feel everybody has abandoned them.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Basically, our state has changed,&#x26;rdquo; Manchin said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He predicted that Trump&#x26;#39;s campaign would be able to draw a &#x26;ldquo;tremendous number&#x26;rdquo; of new voters to the polls in less diverse states. &#x26;ldquo;These are all good people, hard-working people, God-fearing people&#x26;hellip; I&#x26;rsquo;ve known &#x26;#39;em all my life, the people down there.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;They&#x26;rsquo;re hurt,&#x26;rdquo; Manchin said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Bernie Sanders And Donald Trump Win West Virginia Primary</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonwells/primary-results-west-virginia-nebraska?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>Despite losing at the polls Tuesday, however, Hillary Clinton remains nearly uncatchable, capturing 94% of the delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/10/17/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-18095-1462914769-1.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"397\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Mel Evans / AP</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>Bernie Sanders beat out rival Hillary Clinton in the West Virginia Democratic primary Tuesday, where she faced a tough audience over comments she made about the decline of the coal industry.</p>\n\n<p>Donald Trump, meanwhile, handily won West Virginia and the other contest of the night, Nebraska, after the Republican field cleared out last week following the crucial Indiana primary, making him the presumptive presidential nominee.</p>\n\n<p>That left the Democratic presidential race as the only true competition on Tuesday, but one that Clinton would continue to enjoy a wide lead in the all-important delegate count no matter the outcome.</p>\n\n<p>In the delegate race to clinch the Democratic nomination, Clinton stood Tuesday night at 2,238 &mdash; or 94% of the 2,383 delegates needed &mdash; to Sanders&#39; 1,468.
