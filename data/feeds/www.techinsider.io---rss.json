(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-invests-1-billion-in-didi-chuxing-2016-5&quot;&gt;$1 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; in Chinese ride-hailing startup Didi Chuxing means the two will be working closely together, said Didi's president Jean Liu on a conference call with reporters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just what exactly it will be helping Didi with is still very unclear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are very confident that we will benefit each other on product, on technology, and on many other levels,&quot; Liu said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The deal came together after the Didi Chuxing executive team visited Tim Cook at Apple headquarters in Cupertino on April 20. The $1 billion investment closed &quot;like lightning&quot; only a few short weeks later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When asked if Didi Chuxing will be helping with Apple's soured relationship with the Chinese government, Liu only responded that they can help each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The policy makers in China now have been more and more open now,&quot; Liu said. &quot;There&amp;rsquo;s a good foundation that we can help each other in many ways.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters, Apple CEO Tim Cook positioned this investment as a way to grow its presence in China.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0Y404W&quot;&gt;Cook told Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The strategic part of the investment could be to&amp;nbsp;get a leg up on other competitors like Uber on self-driving car technology. Apple has long been rumored to be working on an Apple car, and Didi Chuxing hasn't said whether or not it's actively working on&amp;nbsp;self-driving technology now. Instead, Liu said, the company is&amp;nbsp;building a technology platform that is designed to work with any partners.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&amp;rsquo;re big believers in autonomous driving and we believe technology is the solution,&quot; Liu said. &quot;We can work with different partners on autonomous driving, and it is technology neutral.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The investment&amp;nbsp;gives Apple a strong foothold into the Chinese market. Didi is currently operating in more than 400 cities in China, and breaking even in 200 of them. There are more than 14 million registered drivers on the platform, and the company completes 11 million rides a day, Liu said. But, there's still room to grow, and that's where she is hoping Apple may help.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you look at the penetration, it&amp;rsquo;s only 1% in China, even though its 11 million rides,&quot; Liu said. &quot;How do we get to much hire penetration?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Didi&amp;nbsp;is rumored to be raising funds at $25 billion valuation, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-homegrown-rival-to-uber-valued-at-over-25-billion-1460017727?shareToken=st61cbd7eab6a64157af694cdd0c12c491&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal article&lt;/a&gt; from April. Apple's investment is part of an ongoing round for the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&amp;rsquo;s oversubscribed. Much more demand than we originally planned for,&quot; Liu said, without commenting on exactly how much had been committed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing Liu liked? That her company's name translates to &quot;Little Orange.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first time when we met with Mr. Cook we shared with him a joke,&quot; Liu said. &quot;We said our company&amp;rsquo;s legal name is little orange. We figured a company named after a fruit can achieve something big.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/didi-explains-apple-investment-2016-5#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;NOW WATCH: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/save-battery-life-tech-iphone-apple-apps-2016-3&quot;&gt;Apple says this commonly used hack won\u2019t actually make your iPhone battery last longer &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>\n                                            <media:thumbnail url=\"http://static1.techinsider.io/image/573552fddd0895ac198b4583/apples-1-billion-investment-in-didi-came-together-in-less-than-a-month.jpg\" />\n                                                                <media:credit>Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP</media:credit>\n                                    </item>\n                                               <item>\n                    <guid>http://www.techinsider.io/apple-invests-1-billion-in-didi-chuxing-2016-5</guid>\n                    <title>Apple just took a $1 billion shot at Uber</title>\n                    <link>http://www.techinsider.io/apple-invests-1-billion-in-didi-chuxing-2016-5</link>\n                    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:33:18 -0400</pubDate>\n                                            <dc:creator>Matt Weinberger</dc:creator>\n                                        <description>\n                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;http://static2.techinsider.io/image/55d3f63cdd08951b058b457c-4896-3264/scmp_15jun15_ch_nosmoking_50850119.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Didi Kualdi&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Simon Song&quot; data-mce-caption=&quot;Taxi-hailing app Didi Kuaidi controls around 90 per cent of the Chinese market.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has invested $1 billion in Didi&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Chuxing&lt;/span&gt;, Uber's biggest car-hailing competition in China, the companies announced on Thursday evening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Didi Chuxing is said to control&amp;nbsp;most of&amp;nbsp;the Chinese market for car-hailing services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters, Apple CEO Tim Cook positioned this investment as a way to grow its presence in China.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0Y404W&quot;&gt;Cook told Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Didi Chuxing was attempting to raise funding at a valuation of&amp;nbsp;$25 billion USD, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-homegrown-rival-to-uber-valued-at-over-25-billion-1460017727?shareToken=st61cbd7eab6a64157af694cdd0c12c491&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&amp;nbsp;reported&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in April.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With this round, Apple joins the ranks of Didi&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Chuxing (&lt;span&gt;formerly Didi Kuaidi),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;investors, including Tencent and Alibaba, trying to stem off Uber's rapid global growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Uber has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-china-users-pay-with-alipay-outside-of-china-2016-5&quot;&gt;taken the threat of&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Didi&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-china-users-pay-with-alipay-outside-of-china-2016-5&quot;&gt;Chuxing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;seriously.&amp;nbsp;Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has committed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/ubers-ceo-calls-losing-1-billion-a-year-in-china-sustainable-2016-3&quot;&gt;losing $1 billion a year in China&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to compete with Didi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Didi Chuxing, meanwhile,&amp;nbsp;has partnered up with services like Lyft, Uber's biggest domestic rival, to form &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/lyft-didi-ola-grab-anti-uber-alliance-launches-2016-4&quot;&gt;a global &quot;Anti-Uber Alliance.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apple's investment&amp;nbsp;might hint at the Cupertino-based company's&amp;nbsp;long-rumored plans to get into the automotive business: Uber is investing heavily in self-driving car technology, and Apple's investment in Didi&amp;nbsp;might be a way for the company to head it off at the pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cook is still downplaying Apple's car ambitions, for now.

Those guidelines say that curators are supposed to blacklist\u00a0news posts only if they're false or if they duplicate another topic already covered. They also say that curators may inject stories, but only if they're shown to be trending by an alternate tool (the &quot;Trending Demo&quot; tool) that the curators don't normally use. They are not supposed to inject topics based on their own editorial judgment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zuck's full response is here:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\t&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzuck%2Fposts%2F10102830259184701&amp;amp;width=500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; style=&quot;border:none;overflow:hidden&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;embed-spacer&quot;&gt;This is the part of Facebook everybody's in an uproar about \u2014 not the main news feed, but the little &quot;Trending&quot; box to the side:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;embed-spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static3.techinsider.io/image/57294616dd08952c7f8b4672-991-622/_1__facebook.png&quot; alt=&quot;_1__Facebook_&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Facebook&quot;&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-trending-stories-controversy-2016-5#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;NOW WATCH: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/light-pollution-environment-leds-2016-5&quot;&gt;Astronauts found something troubling about our cities in these shots from space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>\n                                            <media:thumbnail url=\"http://static4.techinsider.io/image/57353958dd0895ce298b4846/zuckerberg-no-evidence-to-support-trending-news-controversy.jpg\" />\n                                                                <media:credit>Daniel Biskup</media:credit>\n                                    </item>\n                                               <item>\n                    <guid>http://www.techinsider.io/oracle-google-what-is-java-2016-5</guid>\n                    <title>Here's what the $9 billion fight between Google and Oracle is all about (ORCL, GOOG)</title>\n                    <link>http://www.techinsider.io/oracle-google-what-is-java-2016-5</link>\n                    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 20:37:08 -0400</pubDate>\n                                            <dc:creator>Matt Weinberger</dc:creator>\n                                        <description>\n                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;http://static6.techinsider.io/image/573521cddd089583598b4899-1500-1000/eric-schmidt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Eric Schmidt&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach&quot; data-mce-caption=&quot;Eric Schmidt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, Google and Oracle have been locked in a pitched legal battle &amp;mdash; this week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-wants-93-billion-from-google-2016-3&quot;&gt;Oracle is seeking almost $9 billion in damages in a second trial&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Oracle's lawsuit is the allegation that Google improperly used pieces of the mega-important Java technology in Android without paying properly for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Google argues&amp;nbsp;that the way it used Java constitutes&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-oracle-case-2016-3&quot;&gt;&quot;fair use,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and that it's impossible to copyright the pieces of Java which it put into Android.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The outcome of this trial will send shockwaves through the tech industry: If Oracle wins, it's going to make it a lot more complicated, legally speaking, to build software that works with other software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But what, exactly, is Java?&amp;nbsp;Why&amp;nbsp;did Google use it in the first place? And why is Oracle so mad?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;A brief history of Java&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on who you ask, Java is either the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index&quot;&gt;most popular&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2016/02/19/language-rankings-1-16/&quot;&gt;second-most-popular&lt;/a&gt; programming language in the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Huge chunks of Amazon, Google, Netflix, PayPal, and lots of others all power their web applications and software with Java, right alongside other popular languages like C++.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Java gots its start at early Silicon Valley superpower Sun Microsystems in 1991, in a group led by famed programmer James Gosling. Gosling and his team based it on its forebear, the still-very-popular C++ language, but with an eye towards the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;See, Java is known to be pretty slow, compared to lots of other languages. But it's stable, and reliable, and best of all, it works on any kind of PC there is, from Windows to Mac to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static5.techinsider.io/image/55ae7afedd089556468b45ba-1460-1469/james_gosling_2008-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;James Gosling&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Wikimedia Commons&quot; data-mce-caption=&quot;James Gosling, inventor of the Java programming language.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hardcore hipster programmers kind of look down their nose at Java as stolid and old-fashioned, especially in the era of the smartphone and the web application, but it has lots of attributes that big, well-paying enterprises love.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Java. Not exciting, hardly wearable, but very predictable. A language for building great big things for great big places with great big teams,&quot; wrote Paul Ford in the seminal Bloomberg Businessweek essay &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/&quot;&gt;What Is Code&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in 2015. &quot;People complain, but it works.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And because it works so reliably and so well, there's always a market for programmers who know Java. And, in turn, it means there are lots of programmers with Java expertise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Oracle bought Sun Microsystems. Soon after, Google's legal troubles began.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The rise of Android&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Google bought a startup called Android for around&amp;nbsp;$50 million, bringing its team on board to help build a new mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That team, knowing full well that the smartphone market was poised to explode, was racing the clock to get Android to market. To do that, they built on top of freely available technologies, like the Linux kernel and Sun's Java programming language.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For Google, the&amp;nbsp;thought was twofold: First, lots of developers already know Java very well, so they wouldn't have anything to re-learn when they were building Android apps. Second, thanks to its popularity, Java itself has rich, deep support for lots of behind-the-scenes things Google needed in a new operating system, and saw no reason to reinvent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static2.techinsider.io/image/561bda6add0895e4708b4666-2752-2064/ap110202036403.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;andy rubin google android&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;AP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During this week's trial, former Google CEO and current Alphabet executive chairman &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-considered-40-million-five-year-java-license-trial-testimony-2016-5&quot;&gt;Eric Schmidt testified that the company tried to pay Sun as much as $40 million to license Java for Android&lt;/a&gt;. Those talks fell apart, meaning that Google didn't use the official Java logo for Android or some of its technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But, and here's the crucial part, you can't copyright or own a programming language, any more than you could the English language. And so, Google moved ahead with Java in Android, replicating itself whatever pieces it couldn't license from Sun and building the rest from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Schmidt testified that Google didn't believe it was doing anything wrong, because that code was freely available. Sun may or may not have been really upset about Android's usage of Java, but it wasn't in the company's nature to go after Google. Oracle has no such&amp;nbsp;hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Sticky&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is where Google got itself into this legally-sticky territory, it should be noted: Oracle contends that while it may be legal for Google to use the Java programming language, it stepped over a line when it used some of that code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oracle's&amp;nbsp;issue is that Google used some of Sun's Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs &amp;mdash; kind of the &quot;hooks&quot; that computer programs use to talk to each other &amp;mdash; to access some of those behind-the-scenes Java features. And while the Java language may be immune to copyright, Oracle says those connectors are its own intellectual property.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static2.techinsider.io/image/573521cddd089583598b489a-2000-1500/15180124055_4c1d340bab_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google campus android&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Jan Pecek/Flickr&quot; data-link=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/janpecek/15180124055/in/photolist-6kzXBW-pKsQcA-cwr9kY-dW83E8-p8q71P&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/oracles-lawsuit-against-google-continues-and-is-still-important-2014-12&quot;&gt;larger tech industry disagrees mightily that this usage violated Oracle's rights&lt;/a&gt;, or indeed that you can copyright an API. But it should also be noted that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/andy-rubin-testifies-in-oracle-v-google-2016-5&quot;&gt;an e-mail from former Android boss Andy Rubin&lt;/a&gt;, which surfaced in court on Wednesday, could also&amp;nbsp;indicate that Google was aware&amp;nbsp;it was circumventing copyright when it used the APIs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The outcome of this trial is going to have shockwave effects on the whole tech industry: If the APIs that are used to call on certain parts of Java are copyrightable and not subject to fair use, per Google's defense, then it's going to get real messy in the world of software, really quickly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/oracle-google-what-is-java-2016-5#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;NOW WATCH: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/john-mcafee-free-apps-danger-android-iphone-2016-3&quot;&gt;JOHN MCAFEE: Why downloading free apps is dangerous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>\n                                            <media:thumbnail url=\"http://static5.techinsider.io/image/573521cddd089583598b4899/heres-what-the-9-billion-fight-between-google-and-oracle-is-all-about.jpg\" />\n                                                                <media:credit>REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach</media:credit>\n                                    </item>\n                                               <item>\n                    <guid>http://www.techinsider.io/venkata-murthy-renduchintala-explains-why-he-joined-intel-2016-5</guid>\n                    <title>The man Intel paid $25 million to poach from Qualcomm explains why he jumped ship (INTC)</title>\n                    <link>http://www.techinsider.io/venkata-murthy-renduchintala-explains-why-he-joined-intel-2016-5</link>\n                    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 20:36:28 -0400</pubDate>\n                                            <dc:creator>Eugene Kim</dc:creator>\n                                        <description>\n                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;http://static4.techinsider.io/image/5735219edd0895f7538b4893-667-500/venkata-murthy-renduchintala-2x1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intel executive Venkata Murthy Renduchintala&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Intel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel paid roughly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-to-pay-25-million-to-former-qualcomm-executive-1455312038&quot;&gt;$25 million last year&lt;/a&gt; to bring in Qualcomm's former copresident, Venkata &quot;Murthy&quot; Renduchintala.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was a big move given Renduchintala's decades of experience, but also a shocker since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/intel-increasing-outside-hires-2015-12&quot;&gt;Intel rarely hires&lt;/a&gt; top execs from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And in just about six months, Renduchintala has clearly established himself as the No. 2 person at Intel.&amp;nbsp;His influence at the company was strengthened when CEO Brian Krzanich essentially handed him the keys to making the final call over its $1.2 billion reorganization plan, which includes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/intel-murthy-will-help-determine-product-cuts-2016-4&quot;&gt;12,000&amp;nbsp;job cuts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Renduchintala hasn't made a whole lot of public statements since his move to Intel. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/murthy-renduchintala-winning-truly-connected-world/?cid=em-elq-10548&amp;amp;utm_source=elq&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=10548&amp;amp;elq_cid=1423723&quot;&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, he laid out his vision for the company&amp;nbsp;and explained for the first time why he joined the world's largest chipmaker.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His point in a nutshell: The Internet of Things space is blowing up, and Intel is in a good position to own the space.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He writes:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, connectivity is defined by people connecting to other people and to the cloud primarily through mobile devices &amp;mdash; smartphones, PCs, tablets and the like. In the future we will add more than 50 billion smart and connected devices, machines, autonomous vehicles, buildings and cities. These devices will be always on and connected, and demand the greatest data bandwidth possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;...With this revolution, definitions also change. This is true for mobile. No longer just phones, mobile is now about connecting the billions of &quot;things&quot; &amp;mdash; inclusive of phones, tablets and PCs. Intel is creating the next wave of world-class connectivity assets &amp;mdash; LTE and 5G modems, RF, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet &amp;mdash; needed to power devices, networking and storage. We're aligning our products and architectures to an entire panorama of smart and connected devices, and in so doing we're enabling exciting new experiences. We are not exiting mobile, but we are broadening its definition to make it synonymous with the interconnectedness of the more than 50 billion &quot;things.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;...With decades of experience in creating open ecosystems, powering the world's PCs and servers, and embedding intelligence into unexpected devices, Intel is uniquely positioned to deliver the comprehensive portfolio of end-to-end hardware and software technologies for this revolution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Intel famously missed the shift to mobile, and earlier this month, basically admitted that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/intel-kills-its-next-smartphone-and-tablet-chips-2016-5&quot;&gt;it's giving up on that market&lt;/a&gt;. With a declining PC market, which has long been Intel's core revenue driver, the chipmaker has been looking for the next growth&amp;nbsp;engine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company's&amp;nbsp;data-center chip&amp;nbsp;business, which powers a lot of the internet services for other companies, enjoys&amp;nbsp;a near-dominant position, but it still needs to keep tabs on where the next big thing will come from. Renduchintala's comments make it clear that it sees the IoT business, although tiny relative to Intel's overall revenue, as the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I know that we'll win in the connectivity revolution fueled by the IoT,&quot; he wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/venkata-murthy-renduchintala-explains-why-he-joined-intel-2016-5#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;NOW WATCH: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/how-to-make-the-rainbow-cake-that-changes-color-2016-4&quot;&gt;The internet is obsessed with this cake that changes color&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>\n                                            <media:thumbnail url=\"http://static3.techinsider.io/image/5735219edd0895f7538b4893/the-man-intel-paid-25-million-to-poach-from-qualcomm-explains-why-he-jumped-ship.jpg\" />\n                                                                <media:credit>Intel</media:credit>\n                                    </item>\n                                               <item>\n                    <guid>http://www.techinsider.io/google-funny-drone-job-listing-2016-5</guid>\n                    <title>Google's drone group wants to hire someone who thinks 'flying airplanes is cooler than crashing airplanes' (GOOG, GOOGL)</title>\n                    <link>http://www.techinsider.io/google-funny-drone-job-listing-2016-5</link>\n                    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 20:31:05 -0400</pubDate>\n                                            <dc:creator>Alexei Oreskovic</dc:creator>\n                                        <description>\n                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;http://static3.techinsider.io/image/56eab95ddd0895d3398b470c-3000-1968/gettyimages-1602582.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Larry Page&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Justin Sullivan / Getty&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is racing to develop airborne &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-testing-delivery-drones-2013-12&quot;&gt;drones that can ferry packages&lt;/a&gt; straight to consumers' doorsteps and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-skybender-2016-1&quot;&gt;beam internet connectivity&lt;/a&gt; to people below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It's a race against rival Amazon, which is also working on drone delivery, and the Google X subsidiary that oversees Alphabet's drone effort is looking to hire various aerospace experts, from guidance and navigation-control managers to computer-vision engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While Google is known as an intense and high-pressure place to work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/about/careers/jobs#!t=jo&amp;amp;jid=/x/software-engineer-airspace-management-1600-amphitheatre-parkway-mountain-view-2580005&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;a recent job listing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for its drone effort reveals a humorous side.

The emphasis is on creating locally-sourced, pre-portioned meals that even the newest of cooks can make at home, without sacrificing time or nutrition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And now Karp and Dumaine are about to release a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1101903937?tag=randohouseinc12146-20&quot;&gt;brand-new cookbook&lt;/a&gt; based on the techniques they've used in their work for Plated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The book is anchored on &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;Plated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-style recipes with respect to key techniques and very detailed instruction, but it enabled us to elaborate on those with different types of recipes, from Thanksgiving dinner to brunch to desserts and side dishes,&quot; Karp told Business Insider. &quot;&lt;span&gt;We were also able to make the recipes more flexible, allowing you to take each recipe and customize it by season, occasion, and the amount of time you have in the kitchen, whether it's 30 minutes or 2 days.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;That means the recipes cover a lot of ground, from a simple pan-roasted salmon with seasonal vegetables to a somewhat more complicated roast Peking duck. The authors also include some beginner's tips, like how to wield a chef's knife and how to make basic sauces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karp and Dumaine shared some of their best advice for those who are just getting started in the kitchen. Their book,&amp;nbsp;&quot;Plated: Weeknight Dinners, Weekend Feasts, and Everything in Between&quot;, will be released May 17, though it is currently available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plated.com/cookbook&quot;&gt;pre-order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static2.techinsider.io/image/5734d9a6dd0895ef688b475b-400-300/.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&quot;Start simple.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's important not to try to do too much before learning the basics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Don't bite off more than you can chew while you're still getting comfortable in the kitchen. There are plenty of easy and delicious recipes that don't require a million pots and pans or hours of prep,&quot; Karp said. &quot;If you plan around what you know you'll have time for, you can get something great on the table without sweating over it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the Plated team's favorites is their&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;One-Pan Roasted Rosemary Chicken with Seasonal Vegetables (pictured above).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;span&gt;It's an easy recipe that teaches core techniques, it's so easy to customize by season, and always creates that 'ta-da' moment when the chicken comes out of the oven, smelling (and looking) amazing,&quot; Karp said. &quot;It always makes people feel proud.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static1.techinsider.io/image/5734d9a6dd0895ef688b475c-400-300/.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get comfortable with your kitchen knives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We can't overstate the importance of knowing how to hold and use your knife, and getting comfortable with it,&quot; Karp said. &quot;&lt;span&gt;The better you become at prepping your food, the quicker you'll be able to prepare your food and even tackle more ambitious recipes (without panicking at the sight of the ingredient prep ahead).&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static6.techinsider.io/image/5734d9a6dd0895ef688b475d-400-300/.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Learn how to marinate.&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The magic of a good marinade is that it will both amp up the flavor of your dish and save you serious time. Karp and Dumaine devoted an entire section of their cookbook to perfecting marinades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;A marinade only requires a few ingredients and a whisk, and will automatically infuse your food with tremendous flavor &amp;mdash; no major prep needed,&quot; Karp said. &quot;With certain cuts of meat, you can even marinate up to 24 hours, so no need to babysit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/best-advice-for-busy-cooks-from-plated-2016-5#/#-4&quot;&gt;See the rest of the story at Tech Insider&lt;/a&gt;                                            </description>\n                                            <media:thumbnail url=\"http://static2.techinsider.io/image/5734d9a6dd0895ef688b4759/the-culinary-team-behind-meal-delivery-startup-plated-shares-their-best-advice-for-people-who-are-too-busy-to-cook.jpg\" />\n                                                                <media:credit>Robert Bredvad / Plated</media:credit>\n                                    </item>\n                                               <item>\n                    <guid>http://www.techinsider.io/chinese-tech-workers-sleep-in-office-2016-5</guid>\n                    <title>China's tech work culture is so intense that people sleep and bathe in their offices</title>\n                    <link>http://www.techinsider.io/chinese-tech-workers-sleep-in-office-2016-5</link>\n                    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:28:00 -0400</pubDate>\n                                            <dc:creator>Sarah Jacobs</dc:creator>\n                                        <description>\n                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;http://static1.techinsider.io/image/5734cfa6dd0895de4b8b45fa-2500-1666/rtx2dq8t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RTX2DQ8T&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Jason Lee&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's technology sector is booming at an intensely&amp;nbsp;fast pace.

Many employees&amp;nbsp;are encouraged to live at the office during the workweek. Lunchtime naps are generally allowed, and those who end up staying past midnight usually pass out in the office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reuters photographer Jason Lee recently got an inside look at the phenomenon. Here's what he saw:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;For companies whose employees regularly work past midnight, such as at BaishanCloud, bunk beds are provided for employees to crash in during the workweek.&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://static6.techinsider.io/image/5734cfa6dd0895de4b8b45fd-400-300/for-companies-whose-employees-regularly-work-past-midnight-such-as-at-baishancloud-bunk-beds-are-provided-for-employees-to-crash-in-during-the-workweek.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;IT engineers and programmers regularly work overtime. &quot;Actually working overtime is a very casual thing,&quot; 28-year-old programmer Xiang Shiyang told Reuters. &quot;Because I've invested the whole of my being into this company.&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://static2.techinsider.io/image/5734cfa6dd0895de4b8b45fe-400-300/it-engineers-and-programmers-regularly-work-overtime-actually-working-overtime-is-a-very-casual-thing-28-year-old-programmer-xiang-shiyang-told-reuters-because-ive-invested-the-whole-of-my-being-into-this-company.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some employees at RenRen Credit Management Co. sleep on provided camp beds in their office.&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://static4.techinsider.io/image/5734cfa6dd0895de4b8b45ff-400-300/some-employees-at-renren-credit-management-co-sleep-on-provided-camp-beds-in-their-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/chinese-tech-workers-sleep-in-office-2016-5#/#product-managers-grab-some-shut-eye-in-the-early-mornings-4&quot;&gt;See the rest of the story at Tech Insider&lt;/a&gt;                                            </description>\n                                            <media:thumbnail url=\"http://static1.techinsider.io/image/5734cfa6dd0895de4b8b45fc/chinas-tech-work-culture-is-so-intense-that-people-sleep-and-bathe-in-their-offices.jpg\" />\n                                                                <media:credit>Jason Lee</media:credit>\n                                    </item>\n                                               <item>\n                    <guid>http://www.techinsider.io/allergan-cco-bill-meury-on-prospects-2016-5</guid>\n                    <title>Allergan is geared up for a major change after its failed Pfizer merger (AGN)</title>\n                    <link>http://www.techinsider.io/allergan-cco-bill-meury-on-prospects-2016-5</link>\n                    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:12:00 -0400</pubDate>\n                                            <dc:creator>Lydia Ramsey</dc:creator>\n                                        <description>\n                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;http://static1.techinsider.io/image/57335d12dd0895f7538b45e0-762-571/allergan-reports-48-percent-rise-in-quarterly-revenue-2016-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Allergan ticker info and symbol are displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) April 6, 2016.

Once that's done, the company will be mainly focused on branded pharmaceutical products.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After all the activity, Business Insider caught up with Allergan's newly promoted Chief Commercial Officer Bill Meury and Herm Cukier, Senior Vice President of Women's Healthcare, to hear what's up next for the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Beyond Botox&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It's been about a month since the Pfizer deal fell through, and Meury&amp;nbsp;says it hasn't been a huge disruption. Only a tiny number of people were involved in pre-integration work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a testament to the management team as well as the R&amp;amp;D organization to stay focused at a time when there was &amp;nbsp;potentially a great deal of change,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Allergan is most widely known for its best-selling Botox, which is used to treat everything from wrinkles to migraines. Altogether the company has seven therapeutic areas where it's developing products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of its key products is a daily pill to treat uterine fibroids, or noncancerous growths that affect about 80% of all pre-menopausal women. In some women, it can cause pain or heavy bleeding that can be cumbersome. The goal of the medication is to reduce the size of the fibroids so they don't cause as many problems as a better alternative to surgery and some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uterine-fibroids.org/oral-treatments.html&quot;&gt;other oral medications available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've seen studies that show there's more than $30 billion per year in cost to&amp;nbsp;the United&amp;nbsp;States because of uterine fibroids,&quot;&amp;nbsp;Cukier said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meury expects the drug, ulipristal acetate, to be the &quot;flagship&quot; product of the company's women's health program. It just reported its first phase 3 trial results, with more patients on the medication experiencing no bleeding compared to those on the placebo. It's expected to file for approval in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meury also pointed to a new preventative migraine drug in development, a new drug for treatment-resistant depression, and a longer-acting eye drug for macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema&amp;nbsp;as the&amp;nbsp;drugs in the pipeline that he's most excited for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Allergan's&amp;nbsp;first-quarter call, CEO Brent Saunders made a point to distinguish the company as a &quot;growth pharma&quot; company rather than a &quot;specialty pharma&quot; (A group that would lump them in with embattled Valeant Pharmaceuticals among others).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;G&lt;span&gt;rowth is what our investors want and it shows our commitment to customers,&quot; Meury said. &quot;Whether it's called specialty pharma or growth pharma, it's our commitment to doing what do best, which is introduce novel compounds to the healthcare community.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/allergan-cco-bill-meury-on-prospects-2016-5#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;NOW WATCH: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/gallium-safe-metal-liquid-mercury-2016-5&quot;&gt;This mystifying metal is liquid like mercury but safe to touch with bare hands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>\n                                            <media:thumbnail url=\"http://static3.techinsider.io/image/5638c0f6dd08952d4e8b464c/allergan-is-geared-up-for-a-major-change-after-its-failed-pfizer-merger.jpg\" />\n                                                                <media:credit>Thomson Reuters</media:credit>\n                                    </item>\n                                               <item>\n                    <guid>http://www.techinsider.io/new-bone-crushing-dog-species-2016-5</guid>\n                    <title>Scientists just discovered an ancient 'bone crushing' dog that ate like a bear</title>\n                    <link>http://www.techinsider.io/new-bone-crushing-dog-species-2016-5</link>\n                    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:13:00 -0400</pubDate>\n                                            <dc:creator>Sean Kane</dc:creator>\n                                        <description>\n                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;http://static6.techinsider.io/image/5734edaa52bcd063018c2aaa-1272-974/anton cynarctus illiustration for release.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cynarctus wangi&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Mauricio Ant&amp;oacute;n&quot; data-mce-caption=&quot;An illustration of Cynarctus wangi from &amp;ldquo;Dogs, Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History.&amp;rdquo;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably won't win a tug of war with this dog. Or want to go near it, for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily it died out millions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Paleontologists just announced the new canine species, called Cynarctus wangi (illustrated above), and it had a fearsomely powerful bite. The animal belonged to the extinct Borophaginae subfamily &amp;mdash; more commonly known as &quot;bone-crushing dogs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A graduate student led the discovery of the fossil dog in the Choptank Formation of the Calvert Cliffs region of Maryland, describing it in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2016.17&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the Journal of Paleontology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Early news reports claimed it&amp;nbsp;was as big as a dire wolf, like the fictional hounds in &quot;Game of Thrones.&quot; But that's a stretch. The dog was actually about the size of a coyote, and it lived along the shore of eastern North America some 12 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;http://static2.techinsider.io/image/5734f13452bcd063018c2ac6-1338-1338/steven e. jasinski for release.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paleontologist and lead author Steven E. Jasinski&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Steven E. Jasinski&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The new bone-crushing dogs weren't picky eaters, as their name might suggest. Their formidable jaws certainly packed a punch, but they didn't only eat meat, leading to a comparison to another fearsome North American beast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Based on its teeth, probably only about a third of its diet would have been meat,&quot; lead author Steven E. Jasinski, a paleontology Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.upenn.edu/news/fossil-dog-represents-new-species-penn-paleontology-grad-student-finds&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;It would have supplemented that by eating plants or insects, living more like a mini-bear than like a dog.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The dog is interesting enough on its own. But the fact that a fossil from this period came from the land and not the sea, like the enormous megaladon shark, is an eye-opening discovery in of itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Most fossils known from this time period represent marine animals, who become fossilized more easily than animals on land,&quot; Jasinski said in the release. &quot;It is quite rare we find fossils from land animals in this region during this time, but each one provides important information for what life was like then.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;C. wangi lived towards the end of the period of borophagine dogs, which were common on the continent from 30 million to 10 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Paleontologists speculate that modern canines, like wolves, coyotes, and even foxes probably outcompeted the bone crushers to extinction. Which is good news to anyone who's afraid of meeting giants dogs in the woods who eat like bears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/dog-breed-diversity-same-species-2016-2&quot;

The lyrics in the nasheed&amp;nbsp;are littered with jihadist terminology, while other games within the app also include militaristic vocabulary with more common, basic words.

It will move from CBS to The CW for its second season.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The probability of a move has been reported for weeks as CBS and producer Warner Bros. have been sparring over the cost of making &quot;Supergirl.&quot; Although Warner Bros., the studio that produces the show, trimmed the budget by moving production to Vancouver for season two, the show's expensive licensing fee kept it from meeting CBS's bottom line&amp;nbsp;for a show with &quot;Supergirl's&quot; ratings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://deadline.com/2016/05/supergirl-moves-the-cw-renewed-season-2-melissa-benoist-1201754579/&quot;&gt;Deadline&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Averaging 10 million viewers, &quot;Supergirl&quot; didn't do too shabby relatively. It was CBS's No. 1 new drama, and its audience was&amp;nbsp;the youngest of the network's new dramas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There was actually some talk&amp;nbsp;during the pilot phase that &quot;Supergirl&quot; should move to CBS's sister network, The CW, which already housed three other DC Comics shows: &quot;Arrow,&quot; &quot;Flash,&quot; and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow.&quot; The CW's audience skews much younger, and &quot;Supergirl&quot; felt like an odd fit in CBS's stable of programming.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CBS, though, has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/supergirl-soars-to-falls-biggest-premiere-ratings-2015-10&quot;&gt;trying to shake off its reputation&lt;/a&gt; for being the old-geezer network with younger-skewing shows like hacker drama &quot;Scorpion&quot; and single-camera comedy &quot;Life in Pieces.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time that a show&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;been shuffled in the family. Sarah Michelle Gellar's &quot;Ringer&quot; was developed at CBS, but ultimately landed on The CW. And Showtime developed &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,&quot; which has become an awards magnet for The CW.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But those changes were made before the shows premiered, so it will be interesting to see what happens for &quot;Supergirl&quot; at its new home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/supergirl-moving-from-cbs-to-the-cw-2016-5#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;NOW WATCH: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/jeb-bush-most-awkward-moments-supergirl-warm-kiss-chest-bump-politics-2015-11&quot;&gt;Jeb Bush\u2019s most awkward moments: warm kisses, chest bumps, and 'Supergirl'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>\n                                            <media:thumbnail url=\"http://static2.techinsider.io/image/5734f835dd08955c778b494a/supergirl-is-moving-to-another-network--heres-why.jpg\" />\n                                                                <media:credit>Robert Voets/CBS</media:credit>\n                                    </item>\n                                               <item>\n                    <guid>http://www.techinsider.io/the-cities-with-the-worlds-worst-air-pollution-who-2016-5</guid>\n                    <title>About 80% of all cities have worse air quality than what's considered healthy \u2014 here are the 15 with the worst air pollution</title>\n                    <link>http://www.techinsider.io/the-cities-with-the-worlds-worst-air-pollution-who-2016-5</link>\n                    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:33:00 -0400</pubDate>\n                                            <dc:creator>Lydia Ramsey</dc:creator>\n                                        <description>\n                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;http://static1.techinsider.io/image/5734f71ddd08957d568b488a-2948-2211/rtr4lmnj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;China air pollution&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;China Daily/Reuters&quot; data-mce-caption=&quot;Parents walk primary school students to school amid thick haze in Chiping county, Shandong province January 16, 2015.

PM 2.5 is especially dangerous because it can&amp;nbsp;get lodged&amp;nbsp;in the lungs and cause&amp;nbsp;long-term health problems like asthma and chronic lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PM 2.5 starts to become a major health problem when there is more than 35.5 micrograms (&amp;micro;g) of PM 2.5 per cubic meter of air, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.epa.gov/airquality/particlepollution/2012/decfsstandards.pdf&quot;&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Environmental Protection Agency. But the World Health Organizations &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/&quot;&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;keeping&amp;nbsp;yearly average PM 2.5 levels three times lower than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most polluted cities on Earth have anywhere between&amp;nbsp;11 and&amp;nbsp;20 times that amount &amp;mdash; based on the new WHO data from cities that collect it&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;and you might be surprised which make the top 15 list this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;15.

An ancient Mayan calendar, constellations, satellite imagery, and his bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By Tuesday, the story had gone viral &amp;mdash; right as archaeological and satellite imagery experts began &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/ancient-mayan-city-may-be-corn-field-2016-5&quot;&gt;voicing intense skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about the claim.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It's easy to get excited about 15-year-old Gadoury's research. It's got all the ingredients for a blockbuster news story: A bright young mind using his talents to find something the experts missed &amp;mdash; something ancient and hidden belonging to a culture that was stamped out centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/teenagers-mayan-city-satellite-photo-causes-controversy-2016-5&quot;&gt;the skeptics are probably right&lt;/a&gt;, and how the tale played out reveals a fascinating flaw with modern society.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;It'd be an uncanny coincidence&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The likelihood that any culture would make a pattern of cities [aligned with the stars] is extremely unlikely,&quot; archaeologist and astronomer &lt;a href=&quot;http://anthonyfaveni.com/&quot;&gt;Anthony Aveni&lt;/a&gt; told Tech Insider.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aveni describes the Yucatan as &quot;honeycombed&quot; with Mayan archaeological sites, and some almost certainly have yet to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He acknowledges that it's possible a site is located where Gadoury is looking. But if there is one, it's probably coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;http://static2.techinsider.io/image/555cf4bc6bb3f7232f798019-2000-1328/belize mayan ruins.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Belize Mayan Ruins&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Shutterstock / milosk50&quot; data-link=&quot;http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-164718575/stock-photo-xunantunich-mayan-ruins.html?src=9v6xS3Pb4uov-mnX7v9pkQ-1-17&quot; /&gt;When it comes down to it, Aveni says, using astronomy to determine the location of a city, and not ample food and water, or defensive advantages of an area's geography, doesn't make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know how such a culture could survive&quot; if it used astronomy to decide where to live, he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, he noted, there are only four written documents, called codices, that remain of the Mayan civilization, though the authenticity of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academia.edu/2762940/New_Questions_about_the_Authenticity_of_the_Grolier_Codex&quot;&gt;one of those is hotly debated&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the records of the culture were burned 600 years ago during the Spanish conquest of the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And yet the modern mythos about the ancient Mayan civilization, and astronomy in particular, endures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;We're all stargazers&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It's true the Maya, like many cultures (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/astrologer-susan-miller-site-and-app-are-hugely-popular-2016-4&quot;&gt;including our own&lt;/a&gt;), were fascinated by the movement of celestial bodies through the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The few Mayan codices still in existence do contain &lt;a href=&quot;http://uknowledge.uky.edu/world_mexico_codices/3/&quot;&gt;almanacs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayacodices.org/discovery.asp&quot;&gt;constellations&lt;/a&gt;, and some ceremonial Mayan buildings even align with the sun &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/civil/maya/mmc07eng.shtml&quot;&gt;at seasonal solstices and equinoxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;http://static2.techinsider.io/image/5734cddb52bcd01f7b8c2515-1280-842/mayan codex madrid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mayan codex madrid&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Michael Wal/Wikimedia (BY CC 3.0)&quot; data-link=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Museo_de_America_Madrid_Codex_01.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But using this idea to locate a whole city, &quot;that the entire layout of an area has a one-to-one correspondence [with the stars],&quot; Aveni says, is a huge stretch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He thinks that what we're actually doing is projecting our own culture's obsession with mapping and astronomy onto the Maya, and that the problem is exacerbated by our ever-improving satellite capabilities to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's about how we use technology,&quot; Aveni says. &quot;It can come back to haunt us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We've seen this time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Remember 2012?

A lot of people are writing about Trump right now, but even by those standards, Black's take is unusual.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The premise was sort of how do you explain Donald Trump to a child,&quot; Black (&quot;Wet Hot American Summer,&quot; &quot;The State&quot;) told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He continued:&amp;nbsp;&quot;So, it's sort of the idea as if he were a wild animal, how would you describe him and how do you deal with him, and it's meant to be lighthearted and silly, but it's also a little bit cutting, I hope.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One passage reads: &quot;The beasty is called an American Trump. / Its skin is bright orange, its figure is plump; / Its fur so complex, you might get enveloped / Its hands are, sadly, underdeveloped.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static3.techinsider.io/image/5734f614dd089583598b4880-1199-900/michael ian black a childs first book of trump simon and schuster.png&quot; alt=&quot;Michael Ian Black A Childs First Book of Trump Simon and Schuster&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Simon &amp;amp; Schuster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Black &amp;mdash; who has a new stand-up special, &quot;Noted Expert,&quot; airing on Friday at 10 p.m. on Epix &amp;mdash; got the idea for the children's book, which he admits is equally intended for&amp;nbsp;adults, after seeing one&amp;nbsp;about Hillary Clinton in a bookstore, which charted her &quot;&lt;span&gt;humble beginnings and rise.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;It was meant to sort of be an inspirational tale, and I just sort of thought about how funny it would be if there was a similar book about Donald Trump, because there's really nothing inspirational about him at all. He was born the wealthy scion to a wealthy real-estate developer, and then just became more wealthy. Yeah. It just sort of made me chuckle. So I started writing and then it sort of evolved into what it ended up being.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But while Trump's success in the presidential race may be good for book sales, Black originally didn't plan on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've been fascinated like the rest of the country,&quot; he said. &quot;And like the rest of the country, I was totally wrong about every aspect of him and his campaign in terms of its endurance and plausibility.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/donald-trump-childrens-book-michael-ian-black-2016-5#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;NOW WATCH: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/donald-trump-slams-hillary-clinton-libya-benghazi-attacks-scandal-politics-2016-5&quot;&gt;New Trump attack ad shows Clinton laughing amid footage from the Benghazi attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>\n                                            <media:thumbnail url=\"http://static1.techinsider.io/image/5734f614dd089583598b4881/a-comedian-has-a-book-explaining-donald-trump-to-children-and-its-cutting.jpg\" />\n                                                                <media:credit>Epix</media:credit>\n                                    </item>\n                                               <item>\n                    <guid>http://www.techinsider.io/andy-rubin-testifies-in-oracle-v-google-2016-5</guid>\n                    <title>The cofounder of Google's Android just proved why you should always be careful what you say in work email (GOOG, ORCL, GOOGL)</title>\n                    <link>http://www.techinsider.io/andy-rubin-testifies-in-oracle-v-google-2016-5</link>\n                    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:23:46 -0400</pubDate>\n                                            <dc:creator>Matt Weinberger</dc:creator>\n                                        <description>\n                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;http://static5.techinsider.io/image/5734f56ddd08954f778b47bb-2634-1975/2949002340_0e516bba00_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Andy Rubin&quot; data-mce-source=&quot;Flickr/Joi Ito&quot; data-link=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One email sent by Android cofounder &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/andy-rubin-out-of-google-2014-10&quot;&gt;Andy Rubin&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 may end up costing Google billions in its ongoing legal war with Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the core of the case is whether or not Google infringed on Oracle's copyright by putting key pieces of the Java technology into the mega-popular Android operating system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Java was first developed by Sun Microsystems, a company that Oracle acquired in 2009. Shortly after the acquisition, Oracle filed a series of lawsuits against Google alleging infringement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To prove its case, Oracle's legal team today dredged up an\u00a0email from 2006, where Rubin acknowledged that the Java programming-language APIs\u00a0were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-considered-40-million-five-year-java-license-trial-testimony-2016-5&quot;&gt;copyrighted by Sun&lt;/a&gt;. This was reported by Vice Motherboard contributing editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarahjeong&quot;&gt;Sarah Jeong on\u00a0Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this email shows\u00a0that not only did Rubin, who was then leading Android, know that the Java application program interfaces were copyrightable, but that Google was knowingly and willfully circumventing Sun's copyright. If and when the jury has to calculate damages owed to Oracle, this could end up seriously hurting Google.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\t&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;p&gt;\n\t\t\tRubin wrote in a 2006 email, &quot;Ha, Wish them luck. Java lang apis are copyrighted. And Sun gets to say who they license the JCK to.&quot;\t\t&lt;/p&gt;\u2014 sarah jeong  (@sarahjeong) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/730840800708296704&quot;&gt;May 12, 2016&lt;/a&gt;\n\t&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\t&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;embed-spacer&quot;&gt;Google, and the technology world at large, have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/oracles-lawsuit-against-google-continues-and-is-still-important-2014-12&quot;&gt;contending that APIs are not subject to copyright\u00a0in the first place&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 it would make it legally difficult or impossible to build any kind of interoperability. That said, in 2014, an appeals court found in favor of Oracle in this lawsuit and ruled that APIs are, indeed, copyrightable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;embed-spacer&quot;&gt;This email doesn't necessarily sink Google's case entirely, though. The lawsuit is still ongoing, and Google's defense hinges on the concept of fair use, the claim that it was legally allowed to use the Java APIs in Android regardless of whether or not Oracle can copyright them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;embed-spacer&quot;&gt;And while on the stand, Rubin walked this email back a little bit, saying that he merely meant that the implementation of the APIs was copyrightable, not the APIs themselves. It's a nerdy, but important, distinction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;embed-spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\t&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;p&gt;\n\t\t\tRubin says that he meant the *implementations* are copyrightable.\t\t&lt;/p&gt;\u2014 sarah jeong  (@sarahjeong) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/730849905669902336&quot;&gt;May 12, 2016&lt;/a&gt;\n\t&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\t&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;embed-spacer&quot;&gt;But if the jury\u00a0finds against Google in this case, then there's lots of buzz around the courtroom\u00a0that Rubin's bombshell email\u00a0could still\u00a0demonstrate &quot;willfulness,&quot; a big factor in determining the damages awarded to Oracle. With Oracle asking for $9 billion in damages, this one email could potentially\u00a0tip the scales and cost Google millions or billions or dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;embed-spacer&quot;&gt;So, as you've probably heard before: Be careful what you say in your work email account, or your company Slack channel, or anywhere a record is kept. You never know when and where it'll come back to haunt you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/andy-rubin-testifies-in-oracle-v-google-2016-5#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;NOW WATCH: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/security-risks-online-shopping-adam-levin-2016-4&quot;&gt;The biggest security mistakes people make when buying things online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>\n                                            <media:thumbnail url=\"http://static4.techinsider.io/image/5734f56ddd08954f778b47bb/the-cofounder-of-googles-android-just-proved-why-you-should-always-be-careful-what-you-say-in-work-email.jpg\" />\n                                                                <media:credit>Flickr/Joi Ito</media:credit>\n                                    </item>\n                                               <item>\n                    <guid>http://www.techinsider.io/new-who-health-air-study-2016-5</guid>\n                    <title>Toxic air is choking these top cities around the world</title>\n                    <link>http://www.techinsider.io/new-who-health-air-study-2016-5</link>\n                    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:08:08 -0400</pubDate>\n                                            <dc:creator>Maya Dangerfield and Dave Mosher</dc:creator>\n                                        <description>\n                        &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\t&lt;script src=&quot;https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;g-ytsubscribe&quot; data-channelid=&quot;UCVLZmDKeT-mV4H3ToYXIFYg&quot; data-layout=&quot;full&quot; data-count=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Air pollution can lead to a cornucopia of life-threatening diseases, and new data from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that 80% of cities aren't meeting guidelines.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These are some of the top cities in regions around the world that are &quot;wreaking havoc on human health,&quot; say WHO representatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Produced by Maya Dangerfield.
