Sajjan today  issued the following statement regarding his participation in a meeting of  defence ministers from countries leading the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic  State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s  meeting with Global Coalition counterparts was an important opportunity to  discuss progress, build momentum, and plan for next steps in the campaign to  degrade and defeat ISIL.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Working  alongside our Coalition Allies and partners to build long term security  solutions in Iraq and Syria is a priority for Canada. To that end, I  underscored Canada&rsquo;s expanded commitment as an active member of the Global  Coalition and highlighted the positive work being carried out by Canadian Armed  Forces members. This includes providing ground training and advising local  Iraqi security forces; supporting aerial surveillance and refueling activities;  and providing intelligence capabilities to the Coalition. </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s meeting highlights the Global Coalition&rsquo;s determination to work  together to defeat ISIL and support efforts towards political reconciliation in  Iraq, as well as Canada&rsquo;s leadership in these efforts. I look forward to  continuing these important discussions at the next Global Coalition meeting of  defence ministers to be held later this year.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-center\">- 30 -</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Associated Links</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/Joint-Statement.pdf\">Joint  Statement on Counter-ISIL/Da&rsquo;esh Cooperation</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2016/02/08/prime-minister-sets-new-course-address-crises-iraq-and-syria-and-impacts-region\">Prime Minister sets new course to  address crises in Iraq and Syria</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Contacts</h2>\r\n<p>Jordan  Owens <br>\r\n  Press Secretary<br>\r\n  Office of the Minister of National Defence<br>\r\n(613) 996-3100</p>\r\n<p>Media  Relations<br>\r\n  Department  of National Defence<br>\r\n  Phone:  613-996-2353<br>\r\n  Toll-Free:  1-866-377-0811<br>\r\n  Email: <a href=\"mailto:mlo-blm@forces.gc.ca\">mlo-blm@forces.gc.ca</a></p>]]></summary><category term=\"Military\"></category></entry><entry><author><name>Canadian Space Agency</name></author><title>Minister Bains to Take Part in Space Rover Demonstration</title><link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1060559&amp;tp=3\"></link><updated>2016-05-04T12:45:00+00:00</updated><id>http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1060559&amp;tp=3</id><summary type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\"><![CDATA[On Thursday,\u00a0May\u00a05, the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, will take part in a demonstration of two new space rover prototypes.
