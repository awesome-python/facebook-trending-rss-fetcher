In the Championship, Middlesbrough securing promotion against closest rivals Brighton on the last day, despite the manager having walked out halfway through the season before returning 48 hours later. In League One, a second successive promotion for Burton Albion, who will play in the second tier in 2016 having not played league football until 2009. And in League Two, Northampton securing the largest points tally of any of the 92 clubs, at the end of a season which started with the threat of liquidation.<br />\n<br />\nAll stories which deserve to be told and remembered. There have also been plenty of tales worth knowing in level five, the National League.<br />\n<br />\nCheltenham Town are already back in the Football League having won the title a year after being relegated, amassing 101 points, 12 more than their nearest rivals. <br />\n<br />\nThey are managed by Gary Johnson, who not too long ago was one came away from guiding Bristol City to the Premier League. No offence to Cheltenham, and Johnson has had a couple of dodgy spells since, but that does appear to be a man punching under his managerial weight.<br />\n<br />\nThe play-offs, meanwhile have been fought out between Forest Green and Dover, Grimsby and Braintree. It will be Grimsby and Forest Green who compete in the final, but Braintree are worth a word.<br />\n<br />\nThey are one of only a handful of semi-professional clubs in the National League, can seat only 550 fans in their ground and often have crowds of fewer. Manager Danny Cowley is a PE teacher as his main job, with his brother Nicky, also a teacher, as his assistant.<br />\n<br />\nYet they came third in the league, and won at Grimsby 1-0, before losing 2-0 at home in the second leg after extra time and having a man sent off.<br />\n<br />\nWhether they can repeat anything like this success next season is highly debatable, but having never come lower than 14th since initially being promoted to this level for the first time ever in 2010, it would be churlish to call this a flash in the pan, for what is a very well run and admirable club.<br />\n<br />\nSo, the play-off finalists. On one hand Grimsby, who spent 106 years in the Football League, who are the only current non-league club to have previously played in English football's top tier. They have history on their side.<br />\n<br />\nOn the other hand Forest Green, a team named after a place that does not exist and who play on top of a hill in the middle of nowhere, who have never played in the Football League and are the world's only vegan club. They have the future on their side.<br />\n<br />\nWhichever team joins Cheltenham in League Two next season, it will be yet another great story to add to this season's book, the greatest compilation since Aesop's Fables. ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3337804/images/s-DEFAULT-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/brandy-brewer/rafa-benitez_b_9915678.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Bye Bye Benitez]]></title>\n      <author>Brandy Brewer</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/brandy-brewer/rafa-benitez_b_9915678.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-sport&amp;ir=UK+Sport</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 09:53:15 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[I've had a bit of a love hate relationship with Newcastle United fans, I love their passion for their club and you have to have the up most respect for them for that, but you get one little transfer deal fall through like 'Bas Dost' not signing on Tuesday ;) and you would think I personally relegated them from the amount of abuse I got off a majority of them on Twitter! <br />\n<br />\nBut you have to hand it to them they are loyal to their club and you have to feel gutted for them this evening, everything was starting to look up for them they had Rafa and he was starting to turn it around, but now they've lost their place in the Premier League and brilliant Manager as Benitez (of course) had a get out clause in his contract if they went down.<br />\n<br />\nNow, no one can deny Mike Ashley is a bit of a tool and hasn't really done his club, players or fans any favours which obviously angers the fans and they kinda push that negativity onto the team which is obviously not really going to help matters.<br />\n<br />\nSo what does the future hold for the toons? Well owner Mike Ashley said in a TV interview last year, 'I'm not going anywhere until we win something' well the best they can hope for now is winning the championship and getting back to the Premier League. <br />\n<br />\nNewcastle is such a big name club but after this I'm not sure they'll attract such a big named manager again like Rafa in the future if they do manage to get back into the Premiere league, sad night on the Tyne tonight pet! <br />\n<br />\nFans who will be down tonight include:<br />\n<br />\nMy Boyfriend <br />\nSting <br />\nJimmy Nail<br />\nBryan Ferry<br />\nGraeme Swann<br />\nRobson Green<br />\nJerome flynn<br />\nBrian Blessed<br />\nChris Eubank<br />\nJohn Mccririck<br />\nAnt and Dec<br />\nCheyrl Tweedy<br />\nMark Knofpler<br />\nSteve Harmison<br />\nGraeme Onions<br />\nAbhisit Vejjajiva (Former Thailand Prime Minister)<br />\n<br />\nHaaaawayyy man best get in the Brown Ales and drown them sorrows ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4312542/images/s-RAFA-BENITEZ-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/gemma-wright/rip-winston_b_9911712.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[RIP Winston]]></title>\n      <author>Gemma Wright</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/gemma-wright/rip-winston_b_9911712.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-sport&amp;ir=UK+Sport</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 09:45:05 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[Winston Anthony Cozier has left this world. Many cricket fans will read today about his contribution to the coverage of the game, about his inimitable voice being the soundtrack to many childhoods, and about how much poorer the world of cricket will be without him. All of these things are true, of course. To thousands of people, Tony was a superb broadcaster with an exceptional knowledge on the game. But he was also, to the blessed few, a very good friend.  I'm counting my lucky stars today that I can call myself one of them. <br />\n<br />\nAlthough writing this is a cathartic process for me, I do it in the hope of imparting at least some of the person that Tony was away from the microphone. Even writing in the past tense causes a fresh flood of tears, such is the great loss felt at knowing that the happy times that always ensued with Tony are gone forever. <br />\n<br />\nTony lived life to the fullest. He spent his adult years following cricket around the world, enjoying the \"apr\u00e8s cricket\" just as much as the games themselves. It would be no overstatement to say he loved a drink. But he loved a good drink. Why swig cheap rum when you can order the most expensive? And wine was just the poor cousin of champagne with Tony. Bubbly and oysters was his perfect meal. <br />\n<br />\nWhen I first met Tony in 2009 in Guyana, my friend Chris and I were drinking 5 year old Eldorado (locally produced rum). Tony was aghast, and immediately ordered a bottle of the 25 year old for us. He was generous like that. \"I can only have one with you\", he said, \"I've got an early flight to Barbados\". He said this every half an hour until 2am, when he finally stumbled off to bed. Tony was about the good times. <br />\n<br />\nI have so many memories like that. The spontaneous, drink imbued socialising that ended long after anyone had intended. The quick working lunch we had planned in London, which Tony said would be helped by champagne, and an after dinner liqueur. Little work was done, so we decamped to the pub to watch the cricket. Craft cider was ordered; the work we had to discuss became a distant memory. A Thai dinner followed, Tony loved his Thai food, with gin and tonics and wine, before a return to the pub and rounds of rum. My early afternoon train home long gone, Tony bundled me into a taxi to Paddington with minutes to spare before the last train home. I awoke, with the beginnings of a monster hangover, in the early hours of the morning as the train pulled in to Bristol Temple Meads. <br />\n<br />\nTony's generosity extended beyond those whom he knew personally. His cricket style commentary of my Dad's life over a video I made for his 70th birthday was the icing on the cake of my Fathers' special day, and I know we will both watch it in the coming weeks with fondness, sadness, and likely a few tears. We recorded his visual intro to the video on opposite sides of the world, as Tony typically struggled with Wi-Fi in far flung regions of the Caribbean to get a Skype connection sufficient to do the job. I know he went above and beyond to find the time and the signal to make it happen because he knew what it meant to me. But that's the guy Tony was. <br />\n<br />\nTony lived and loved cricket. The state of the game in his beloved West Indies in the last few years broke his heart and frustrated him in equal measure.  His outspoken views on what the West Indian Cricket Board were doing to the game often landed him in trouble, but always came from his big, genuine heart. <br />\n<br />\nBut nothing made his eyes sparkle more than when he talked about his Granddaughters. These words, from one of his delightful, eloquent emails, were typical of his effusive comments on them:<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>\"My three precocious, delightful, stunning granddaughters keep me entertained and happy\"</em></strong><br />\n <br />\nFrom his many charming stories, it's clear they were cheeky, mischievous and highly entertaining. They take after their Granddad, then. That sparkle in his eye will surely live on with these bright young girls. <br />\n<br />\nHis parting words in his last email to me sum up perfectly everything he was to me. <br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>\"I'll raise a glass or two of champagne to you. <br />\nAs always, Tony/Winston/His Excellency/Whatever\"</em></strong><br />\n<br />\nIt wasn't widely known that his first name was Winston, (Tony coming from his middle name Anthony) and he liked it that way. Tony, Winston, you were excellency itself. Tonight, I'll raise a glass of my oldest Eldorado rum to you. My life is richer for having had you in it, and poorer for you having left it. Barbados, cricket, and my world, will never be the same again. RIP Winston. ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4312494/images/s-TONY-COZIER-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/05/12/official-premier-league-201617-football-kits-chelsea-manchester-united-and-liverpool-release-new-strips_n_9924794.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Official Premier League 2016/17 Football Kits: Chelsea, Manchester United And Liverpool Release New Strips]]></title>\n      <author>Elliot Wagland</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/05/12/official-premier-league-201617-football-kits-chelsea-manchester-united-and-liverpool-release-new-strips_n_9924794.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-sport&amp;ir=UK+Sport</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 05:15:22 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<p>Is that time of the year when Premier League teams start to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/new-premier-league-201617-football-kits-arsenal-manchester-united-strips-and-tottenham-strips-revealed-on-twitter-pictures_uk_57319f07e4b0ade291a25b23?ca4ibln47t2p96yldi&amp;\">release their 2016/17 kits</a> and you can see all the official photos here.</p><br />\n<p>Chelsea have released their new kit along with Manchester United who unveiled their new blue away strip.

The Italian's predicament prior to life at the King Power Stadium was anything but the rosy state he currently finds himself in.<br />\n<br />\nJust two major trophies - one at Fiorentina, the other at Valencia - were all he had to show for in a career spanning 16 clubs in almost two decades, and the latest hiccup looked to have come when he was sacked by the Greece National Team after just four matches.<br />\n<br />\nIt's no surprise why he was dismissed in Greece. He didn't even live in the country and he often changed the team and formation around, which confused the players. His appointment at Leicester City, then, looked like his last shot at redemption.<br />\n<br />\nWith the media lambasting the decision to hire him as 'baffling' and 'strange', Ranieri knew there was much he needed to change about his own approach, let alone his new team's, if he was to defy the odds and rescue a club that were favourites to go down.<br />\n<br />\nStep one - get the media onside, something his predecessor Nigel Pearson miserably failed at. Before every single press conference at Leicester, Ranieri shook the hands of each journalist that attended. <br />\n<br />\nOnce you don't have the wrath of the media breathing down your neck, life at the club becomes a little easier, allowing the players to focus on the task at hand. <br />\n<br />\nStep two - leave the tactics be. Ranieri has gained the nickname 'Tinkerman' during his career but where has it got him? <br />\n<br />\nWhen he arrived at the club he not only kept his backroom untouched, leaving assistants Craig Shakespeare and Steve Walsh to carry on their work, but allowed the team to maintain their successful 4-4-2 that helped them stave off relegation the season before. <br />\n<br />\nStep three - create a family atmosphere. With the club's reputation coming under fire in pre-season, when three youth team players infamously filmed themselves abusing women on a tour of Thailand, Ranieri moved to unite his players. <br />\n<br />\nHe told reporters that if his team kept a clean sheet against Crystal Palace, he would reward them with free pizza, after watching the team fail to shut out the opposition in any of their first nine games. \"I told them, the clean sheet, I buy everybody a pizza. I think they wait until I improve my offer, okay a pizza and a hot dog.\"<br />\n<br />\nNot only did it pay off, as the Foxes secured a 1-0 victory over Alan Pardew's men, inspiring the team to improve on their defending, but also served as a great team-building moment - allowing the chemistry of the team to grow. <br />\n<br />\nStep four - play it coy. Once he finally had this successful formula taking shape, and the Foxes started to climb the league as a result, media attention was understandably at a high, but all he had to say was 'our goal is 40 points', despite topping the table at Christmas.  <br />\n<br />\nDid he think Leicester could possibly win the league? Of course he did. But if he had bullishly admitted they could do it, they might not have. Even in late March, when they were heading into the business end of the season, he stressed they only had a top six finish in their sights.<br />\n<br />\n\"Now we are fighting to achieve the Europa League. Can you imagine Leicester achieve the Europa League and next season we stay in the Europa League? Unbelievable.\"<br />\n<br />\nBecause what better way to keep your side focused on winning the title when you make out like your merely battling for sixth place?<br />\n<br />\nEven after Leicester had lifted their historic crown, Ranieri moved to immediately set a target for a 10th placed finish next year. He also claimed that the rich clubs would return to form next season and that their triumph was a one off. No doubt to create an even more relaxed environment to give his team a chance at retaining their title.<br />\n<br />\nRanieri said he has gone from being the 'tinkerman' to the 'thinkerman', and it sums up his season perfectly.

That moment was so powerful and overwhelming and I think it highlights the difference that support can make to an athlete's performance and memory of their career. <br />\n<br />\nFour years earlier when I won double gold in Beijing we didn't quite have that same level of noise and enthusiasm to spur me on. But there were still little moments when someone would send me a message of luck or I'd see a Union Flag in the crowd and it would give me that extra little boost that I needed.<br />\n<br />\nWhen we are training there's no support like that and it's just you against the water but when the competitions come around there's a special something in the air. In London it was electric and every time I took my head out of the water those roars hit me and I'd go back under with a renewed vigour. <br />\n<br />\nThere's no way to completely replicate that because it was totally unique and those Games as a whole were just a perfect storm of great performances and British enthusiasm for sport fusing together. <br />\n<br />\nBut we can let our athletes know we're supporting them from afar. I do think that in Rio we can all do a little something to give our athletes that extra couple of percent that could make the difference to winning a medal and just missing out. <br />\n<br />\nThat's what Team GB's Bring on the Great campaign is all about and I think the athletes today are so lucky to be able to benefit from things like social media and get that feeling support when away from home. <br />\n<br />\nTeam GB are also encouraging fans to send messages of support to the athletes at <a href=\"http://www.teamgb.com/bringonthegreat\" target=\"_hplink\">teamgb.com/bringonthegreat</a>. It might not seem like a lot but just something like sending a good luck message can have a huge impact - especially because Team GB will have the messages printed on flags in the Olympic Village and also on their Bahia bands which will be handed out to all the athletes.<br />\n<br />\nThe Bahia band is a traditional Brazilian symbol of good fortune and we can show our support to the team, either by wearing the bands ourselves or by sending in our messages.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you compete at an Olympic Games in another country you're out of your comfort zone for quite a long time and the little things make a big difference. Obviously you've been preparing for that moment for so long but athletes are like everyone else and everyone has those days where you're body just isn't feeling it. So every little nugget that can give you a kick, motivate you and push you on counts and it counts for double when you are on the other side of the world. <br />\n<br />\nOf course it's the athletes who need to perform at the end of the day but we are all in it as one Team GB and if all our athletes know that the country is well and truly behind them then we can achieve some spectacular results together.

The Red Devils are among the elite of world football, and while they may still be going through a period of transition at the moment, that name just has a certain appeal to it.<br />\n<br />\n...Or does it? The decisions of numerous transfer targets since the turn of the century seem to suggest otherwise. <br />\n<br />\nUnited have just this week been beaten (again) in the transfer market to another of their primary targets, and here's the lowdown on that deal plus five others that have put egg on United faces in the past.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. Renato Sanches</strong><br />\n<br />\nFirst up, the man who has become the latest to sign for another club right under United's noses. <br />\n<br />\nGenerally considered one of the most impressive teenage footballers in the world, you'll perhaps have come across Renato Sanches and his dreadlocked hair trailing in the wind in one of Benfica's domestic or Champions League matches this season. Or, perhaps you'll have seen him in the transfer gossip columns online and in the newspapers.<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps the latter is more likely. The box-to-box midfielder has been hugely impressive this season and United were rumoured (for months) to be close to completing a transfer for him in the British press. <br />\n<br />\nIt came as a surprise to everybody, but Bayern Munich confirmed their deal to sign him on Tuesday and have made United look very, very silly in the process.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. Toni Kroos</strong><br />\n<br />\n\u200bTalking of Bayern Munich midfielders, United were hot on the tail of German World Cup-winning star Toni Kroos just a couple of summers ago. <br />\n<br />\nNot a day would go by, it seemed, without the latest twist in the saga. David Moyes was desperately attempting to put his stamp on the team towards the end of his first - and in the end, only - season in charge at Old Trafford, and Kroos was key to his idea of a new look United.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, Moyes was sacked just ten months into his reign, and all of the hard work he'd reportedly put in to bringing Kroos to Old Trafford was undone. Louis van Gaal pulled the plug on the deal, and Kroos went on to join Real Madrid instead.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. Cesc Fabregas</strong><br />\n<br />\nTwo summers' worth of effort, this one took. And all for nothing.<br />\n<br />\nCesc Fabregas had already shown in his years at Arsenal that he was more than accustomed to the Premier League, and United recognised that. They'd seen a number of offers rejected by Barcelona in 2013 to bring him back to England, and after getting a second wind - went back in for the Spaniard the following summer.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, reports at the time claimed that Chelsea - who'd made an offer for the player themselves - had won the race to sign Fabregas because his girlfriend preferred living in London over Manchester.<br />\n<br />\nThen again, separate reports claim LvG put paid to the deal when he took over too.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Arjen Robben</strong><br />\n<br />\nWe could continue on all day by mentioning the likes of Thiago Alcantara, Pedro and Roberto Firmino from United's failed (and more recent) transfer dealings, but let's take a blast into the past.<br />\n<br />\nCast your mind back to 2004. United had already had their hands on Cristiano Ronaldo, and another of European football's future star names nearly joined too. Arjen Robben was lighting up the Dutch Eredivisie with PSV, and United had seemed all set to secure his signature.<br />\n<br />\nThe trouble was, Sir Alex Ferguson was willing to pay no more than \u00a35million. Chelsea came along with more than double the money, and no surprises for guessing where he ended up.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Ronaldinho</strong><br />\n<br />\n\u200bCan you imagine if this one had gone through?<br />\n<br />\nManchester United and Ronaldinho. Just think about it, how different would football have been? Would Barcelona be Barcelona? Would Lionel Messi be slightly worse without Ronnie's guidance? Who knows. It would have been great for the Premier League though.<br />\n<br />\nThe Brazilian has admitted he was a mere 48 hours away from officially signing for United from Paris Saint Germain in 2003 - but Barca presidential candidate Sandro Rosell stepped in to hijack the deal at the final moment. <br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. Gareth Bale</strong><br />\n<br />\n\u200bThis is the one they've wanted. They still want him. There's no denying that and no withdrawing transfer offers at the final moment. Manchester United would take Gareth Bale this very second if Real Madrid would let him go.<br />\n<br />\nThe Welshman starred for Tottenham for a number of years in the Premier League. United, needing a successor for Ryan Giggs, felt there were none better. Their trouble was, no matter how much money they could throw at Spurs and Bale, the player always wanted that move to Spain.<br />\n<br />\nReal Madrid ended up paying a world record fee to sign the 26-year-old from Tottenham, even while United had put a bigger sum on the table. Maybe it'll happen one day, but it won't be any time soon.<br />\n<br />\n<em>For more fan views or to join the conversation visit <a href=\"http://www.90min.com\" target=\"_hplink\">www.90min.com</a></em> ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4305034/images/s-RENATO-SANCHES-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jamie-beck/caring-for-the-knocked-ou_b_9882422.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Caring for the Knocked-out Boxer: Alvarez-Khan]]></title>\n      <author>Jamie Beck</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jamie-beck/caring-for-the-knocked-ou_b_9882422.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-sport&amp;ir=UK+Sport</link>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 07:22:20 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[It is pleasing to note that since my last blog entry, Nick Blackwell looks to be making a good recovery. He will not box again but the sport will hopefully be able to offer him another career path.<br />\n<br />\nIn the early hours of Saturday morning UK time, Amir Khan got into the ring with Saul Alvarez. Few gave Khan a chance. Not because of limitations on his part but because of the considerable talent the Mexican possesses. I like Khan as a fighter, not simply because we share the same home town but I enjoy the quick hands and movement that his style provides. The limitation is his tendency to get caught, and caught he was. After a encouraging performance in the earlier rounds, Alvarez unleashed the overhand right to bring a premature conclusion.<br />\n<br />\nFrom a medical perspective, the key is what happened next. Khan on the television footage appeared to be out before he hit the floor. The referee may not get the same view but he made a decision after about five seconds to wave the fight off.  His count did not reach ten. Within seconds of that, a medical team was in place to attend to the stricken Khan. There was no hangers on in the ring getting in the way or any other factors delaying the medical teams attendance. Boxing in the past has had to learn a hard lesson that one of the most crucial elements of protecting boxers is that immediate medical care.<br />\n<br />\nRingside care is trauma medicine. In trauma medicine, speed is the key. For years the Golden hour was referred to as the most crucial in obtaining a positive outcome for the victim. More recently, the notion of a \"platinum ten minutes\" has arisen indicating it is the first ten minutes that is of greatest significance. Whatever the debate over the time period, the quick action of medical teams at ringside (as it was with the Blackwell vs Eubank fight) is imperative wherever boxing takes place in the world.<br />\n<br />\nAmir Khan is fine but he could easily not have been and a transfer to a specialist neurology unit would have been the next move if the team had deemed it necessary.<br />\n<br />\nIn a much criticised sport, the last word should be left to Alvarez whose first concern was not celebrating his victory but with his opponent. His conduct in the ring was exemplary and should be noted by other boxers and indeed, participants in other sports. ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3337804/images/s-DEFAULT-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/05/10/farewell-boleyn-upton-park-west-ham_n_9882332.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Historic Images Of Boleyn Ground As West Ham Fans Say Farewell To Upton Park]]></title>\n      <author>Tahira Mirza</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/05/10/farewell-boleyn-upton-park-west-ham_n_9882332.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-sport&amp;ir=UK+Sport</link>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 06:44:59 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<p>West Ham fans will today say an emotional farewell to their beloved Boleyn Ground as the Hammers play their last ever match at Upton Park against Manchester United.</p><br />\n<p>Built in 1904 the stadium has witnessed many memorable and historic moments during its 112 year tenure.</p><br />\n<p>Joint Chairman David Sullivan told <a href=\"http://www.whufc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WHUFC.com</a>: \"I think there will be more tears spilt in one place and in any place in the United Kingdom since Highbury shut.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>\"There will be more men crying tomorrow night than you&rsquo;ll see anywhere in the UK.\"</p><br />\n<p class=\"copy-paste-block\">We take a look at this iconic ground through the years and some of the fond memories it holds for its players and fans.&nbsp;</p><br />\n ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/5731bb9f160000e90031e41c.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/05/10/new-premier-league-201617-football-kits-arsenal-manchester-united-strips-and-tottenham-strips-revealed-on-twitter-pictures_n_9881462.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[New Premier League 2016/17 Football Kits: Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea And Tottenham Strips 'Revealed' On Twitter]]></title>\n      <author>Elliot Wagland</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/05/10/new-premier-league-201617-football-kits-arsenal-manchester-united-strips-and-tottenham-strips-revealed-on-twitter-pictures_n_9881462.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-sport&amp;ir=UK+Sport</link>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 05:16:35 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<p>With the 2015/16 Premier League season nearing an end, the 2016/17 football kits are already being 'revealed'.</p><br />\n<p>So far <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/arsenal/\" target=\"_hplink\">Arsenal</a>, Tottenham and Manchester City strips have been 'leaked' but many turn out not to be genuine.</p><br />\n<p>But some Premier League clubs have already launched their new kit as Manchester United (away kits) Chelsea (home), Leicester City (home), Sunderland (home) and Liverpool (home)&nbsp;have already given fans a glimpse of the shirts their team will be wearing next season.</p><br />\n<div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\"><br />\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Arsenal home puma kit season 2016/2017 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COYG?src=hash\">#COYG</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Arsenal?src=hash\">#Arsenal</a>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gooners?src=hash\">#gooners</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DVL2t2SqqK\">pic.twitter.com/DVL2t2SqqK</a></p>&mdash;

Except we weren't at Guys, but Penzance. 17 guys and 3 guides on a nondescript Thurs evening toasting 342 miles ahead on a bike.<br />\n<br />\nThere is always apprehension the eve of these trips for both riders and guides. 113 miles lay ahead into the unknown. You cut down risk, by doing a thorough reconnaissance of the route, noting dangerous sections, hospitals and stops; a pre-ride medical questionnaire; endless weather forecasts and rider briefings the night before. The fact remains that you're riding with 17 other riders who are completely unknown to you. Can they ride in a group; have they done enough training; have they got the right kit; are their bikes healthy and how will they stand up when the going gets tough. Above all, everyone is praying for a safe trip. You'll soon find out.<br />\n<br />\nGary had been treated for testicular cancer at Guys, under the care of Consultant Oncologist, Mr Simon Chowdhury. Both keen cyclists, Gary set out to repay his debt to the hospital, by organising a charity bike ride from Lands End to Guys in London. Both had enlisted fellow doctors, patients and friends for the challenge. I was the lead guide for Bikecation, organisers of the trip. <br />\n<br />\n6:45am and spirits were high, despite the damp, dark brooding weather. Taxi's to Lands End, followed by a quick 10 mile spin back to the hotel to collect some late risers and the support van. No matter the weather, starts themselves are always full of optimism and high spirits. Set free from the drudgery of the day job, riders are like over-excited children on a school trip. My fourteen years of parenting prepare me well for the constant nagging: have you filled your bottles; have you got food; have you checked your tyre pressures and so on. 8:40am, some 40 mins behind schedule we roll out.<br />\n<br />\nI've never cycled in Cornwall before. Those of your familiar with the county will know that there are endless river tributaries winding their way through picturesque valleys before dribbling out at the sea. The cyclists amongst you will know that valleys mean hills - particularly when you transect them. That is exactly what lay ahead for day 1. Up until lunch, the terrain was relatively kind but that would soon change post lunch. The descents down quiet, windy lanes soon turned to sharp, punchy climbs. None of the climbs on their own would ordinarily trouble a decent cyclist, but one after another would take a cumulative toll. By late afternoon, the attrition rate was high.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-08-1462704471-68632-2016042917.10.18.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-08-1462704471-68632-2016042917.10.18.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-08-1462704471-68632-2016042917.10.18-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"427\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nI've done numerous trips as a guide and I'm still puzzled by the combination of naivety and perhaps male machismo to preparation. It's during the day 1 late afternoon conversations with riders that you discover that a few have done next to no training and quite a few more have already ridden twice the distance of their longest training ride. I'm never sure if it's naivety of the challenge or male machismo (or possibly both) that lies behind the decision that training doesn't seem necessary for a consecutive 3 day, 342 mile bike ride. It's around about this time, that I know that the days will be long; very long.<br />\n<br />\nCycling can be of course a punishing form of physical exercise. Not many are aware of the price it can take mentally, even to those that consider themselves 'tough'. At 85 miles in, we were about to tackle the hardest part of the route. Climbing up and over Dartmoor from the west, before a descent on the far eastern side, into Chagford. My role was to stay with the 'stragglers' and make sure they all got 'home'. The first, brutal climb smashed the group to smithereens. An advance group slowly made their way to Two Bridges (about halfway across) where they were to wait for me and the remaining members of the group. The second climb, what it lacked in steepness, it made up for in length. We slowly, very slowly, inched our way into the heart of Dartmoor. By the time we reached Two Bridges, Dartmoor took a menacing turn. Hearts and minds were shattered when a hail storm of biblical proportions erupted. Freezing, bullets of hail were driven into our faces causing physical pain. Grown men were close to tears. Dartmoor had broken them. Mentally and physically exhausted, we rolled in at 20:30; just 10 mins shy of a mammoth 12 hours in the saddle. <br />\n<br />\nThere was no let up. Day 2, an early start, 1 mile in and the last Cornish climb of 16%. I did wonder if some of the English cooked breakfasts might be making a reappearance. A comedy moment, when a grey animal was spotted running down the right hand side of the lane. \"A badger\" someone shouted from behind. \"Its a bloody cat\" came my reply from the front! <br />\n<br />\nGuiding is not about being the best or fastest rider. It requires empathy and judgment. There is a skill to be learnt in correctly pacing a group. Too fast and gaskets will blow, one by one. The group won't thank you when there's still 40 odd miles to home. Too slow and some of the decent riders get twitchy, wanting to stretch their legs off the front. Male machismo will turn these efforts into competitive sprints, with riders breaking off the front emulating the pro peloton that then risk causing chaos when junctions are missed and guides required to chase back. It also takes a while to mould a group into a functioning peloton. Many of the riders will not have experienced riding in groups. It's almost impossible on the first day, but sometime during day 2, the makings of a peloton are stirred. The benefits of drafting are experienced first hand and slowly but surely a peloton comes together. It helps if the terrain is kinder. That's exactly what happened in the middle of day 2. Gentle rolling roads leading to the Somerset levels meant we could form a peloton (of sorts).<br />\n<br />\nDuring breakfast one of the guides will give the riders a profile for the day ahead. The profile on day 2 contained a beast, lurking at approx 52 miles in. It was whispered all morning in hushed tones. The beast in question was the Quantock hills. The climb resides outside Bridgewater. It is brutal and I suspect is infamous in those parts on Strava. It's a real leg breaker, with a series of ramps, corners and length. Hit this climb hard early on and it will break you. The rewards are worth the effort however. A series of splendid views out westwards over Weston-Super-Mare and into the Severn Estuary punctuate a sumptuous descent. More climbs beckoned when we reached Wells at mile 85. This time the Mendips and a high ridge above Bath city, that rans west to east, followed by a meandering descent through residential streets down to the centre of Bath. A 19:15 finish - a mere 11 hours in the saddle.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-08-1462704395-3575588-2016043014.36.34.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-08-1462704395-3575588-2016043014.36.34.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-08-1462704395-3575588-2016043014.36.34-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"427\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nDay 3 started with a novelty. The Combe Down Tunnel, at an impressive 1672 metres, is just over one mile, and is the UK's and possibly Europe's longest cycle and walking tunnel. Some hoot had even brought a train whistle to add to the experience. A sense of humour would certainly be needed as we had 124 miles ahead of us, taking a route south of the M4 through Devizes, Shalbourne, Greenham, Sandhurst, Weybridge, Kingston-upon-Thames and finally through central London. By now, we had a peloton. A flat(ish) route also meant we could keep a decent, relaxed pace and enjoy some conversation. Last days tend to cement bonds and new friends are made. A glorious sunny day brought out several white, pasty legs fresh from winter's hibernation under tights and leg warmers. Whilst the weather was kind, the same couldn't be said of some of the drivers. A particularly aggressive form of white van man, tried to run one of our group off the road. Perhaps he hadn't noticed the white jersey's emblazoned with the fact it was a charity ride raising funds for a cancer centre. <br />\n<br />\nFor me, I will always remember the scenes from Kingston into central London. The final stop and 4 comics of the group had decided to change into Teletubbies outfits for the last 12 miles. I'll never forget the peloton of 23 riders headed by four Teletubbies taking over the roads of central London. Teletubbies on bikes stop the traffic. Simply brilliant.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-08-1462704521-2136860-2016050117.46.43.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-08-1462704521-2136860-2016050117.46.43.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-08-1462704521-2136860-2016050117.46.43-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"427\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nThe riders entered Guys to a triumphant welcome from friends and family, and rightly so. Many had pushed themselves harder and further than they had ever done before. I'm sure a few had discovered a grit and spirit that they perhaps never knew they had. All had succeeded well out of their comfort zone. <br />\n<br />\nFor the guides, it's a mixture of relief and camaraderie. We had got all riders back safe and sound, without any incident. You can take great pleasure in that as a team. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-08-1462704564-1388247-2016050118.40.50.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-08-1462704564-1388247-2016050118.40.50.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-08-1462704564-1388247-2016050118.40.50-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"427\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nSome facts:<br />\n<br />\nDay 1: Lands End to Chagford<br />\n113 miles & 2,897 metres of climbing<br />\n<br />\nDay 2: Chagford to Bath<br />\n106 miles & 2,311 metres of climbing<br />\n<br />\nDay 3: Bath to Guys, London<br />\n124 miles & 1,513 metres of climbing<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAt the last count, I think Doctors, Patients and Friends had raised almost \u00a3100k for the cancer research centre at Guys. ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3337804/images/s-DEFAULT-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/masha-gordon/mountain-pathways_b_9847880.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Concerns Over Mountain Pathways Should Not Put People Off the Great Outdoors]]></title>\n      <author>Masha Gordon</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/masha-gordon/mountain-pathways_b_9847880.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-sport&amp;ir=UK+Sport</link>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 13:34:07 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[In the past few days, there has been an important public debate about whether we need to charge the public to access pathways on hills and mountains to protect the land for future generations.<br />\n<br />\nMountaineering grandee Sir Chris Bonnington and the British Mountaineering Council have warned that the popularity of walking is wearing away paths and have urged the public to help raise \u00a3100,000 to repair some walkways on popular peaks.<br />\n<br />\nThe BMC has identified eight key mountain routes that need more protection. It is trying to raise money for urgent maintenance on paths such as Lyke Wake Walk in the North York Moors, Ringing Roger on Kinder Scout in the Peak District and Watkin Path on Snowdon. Carey Davies, the BMC's hill walking officer, has made the point that ramblers and climbers have a duty to repair some of the damage they have caused.<br />\n<br />\nWhile I am sympathetic to the campaign, I am concerned about the mixed messages. On the one hand, the Government is encouraging all of us to adopt an active lifestyle. But then we hear the conflicting message that we should be protecting our pathways and, in some cases, restricting access.<br />\n<br />\nThe BMC's call to raise \u00a3100,000 pales in comparison with the ballooning deficit in public healthcare funding due to an increase in the rates of obesity. <br />\n<br />\nHaving benefited enormously from being active outdoors, my strong view would be that we should be doing our utmost to encourage more people - particularly young girls - to take on rambling, hill walking and mountaineering. Not discouraging them.<br />\n<br />\nBeing outdoors teaches kids to take on responsibility, be creative and problem solve. It helps them develop the skills and confidence - the grit - to help them thrive and succeed in life.<br />\n<br />\nI am currently writing this blog perched at an altitude of 6,500m halfway up Everest during my bid to break the female Explorer's Grand Slam record.<br />\n<br />\nIn the past week, I have met with members of a filming crew collaborating with Endemol - the Dutch company that created Big Brother. Their job here on Everest is to shoot enough footage to create a virtual reality experience of climbing the world's tallest mountain.<br />\n<br />\nI have mixed feelings about the project. While it may help discourage poorly-prepared climbers who come here to take on a formidable and, at times, deadly challenge, I fear that by encouraging virtual reality climbing experiences (Everest aside) we will reduce the therapeutic impact that mountaineering and walking has on one's physical and mental health. Why bother climbing the real thing, when you can experience it from the comfort of your own living room?<br />\n<br />\nIt is time we used Big Lottery money for the conservation of our pathways and steer away from any policies or messages that restrict or discourage public access to our hills and mountains. Otherwise, all our kids will know is a virtual reality show formerly known as the 'great outdoors'. ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4271902/images/s-SALTA-SALTA-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
