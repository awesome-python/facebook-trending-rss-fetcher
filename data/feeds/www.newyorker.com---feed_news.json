He is a very warm and genuine person.\u201d Ryan shrugged. &#8220;Like I said, I met him for like thirty seconds in 2012.\u201d That was the year in which Ryan served as Mitt Romney\u2019s Vice-Presidential running mate, and in which Romney flew to Las Vegas to get <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/mitt-romney-misses-his-best-shot-at-donald-trump\">Trump\u2019s endorsement</a>, publicly flattered him, and featured him in radio ads. And it was a year after Trump\u2019s advocacy of birtherism had reached its height. &#8220;So we really don\u2019t\u00a0know\u00a0each other,\u201d Ryan continued. &#8220;And we started to get to know each other. So I actually had a very pleasant exchange with him.\u201d Reporters needed to understand, however, that he wasn\u2019t ready to share everything Trump had said to him; they had been two men learning to trust each other, discussing things that were important and \u201cpersonal, in some senses.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/paul-ryans-quest-to-really-truly-unify-with-donald-trump?mbid=rss\">See the rest of the story at newyorker.com</a></p>Related:<br /><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/america-in-a-time-of-campaign-violence\">America in a Time of Campaign Violence</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/trump-vs-family-values\">Donald Trump vs. Family Values</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/going-there-with-donald-trump\">Going There with Donald Trump</a><br />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>What the Pope Saw at Hiroshima</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-the-pope-saw-at-hiroshima?mbid=rss</link>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.newyorker.com/?p=3202576</guid>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Robin Wright</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:21:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>A charred <a href=\"http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/visit_e/vit_ex_e/vit_ex2_e.html\" target=\"_blank\">tricycle</a>, its rubber pedals melted away, is one of the most evocative relics of war in Hiroshima\u2019s Peace Memorial Museum.
