To determine whether a drug can be used to treat more than one disease, scientists look for overlaps between the set of genes that play a role in each disease: the more genes in common, the more likely the drug can be repurposed to treat both illnesses. The problem is that not all the genes involved in any one disease are always known, they say. <!-- more --></description>\r\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:54:55 EDT</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512145455.htm</guid>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t\t<title>Found: Surviving evidence of Earth's formative years</title>\r\n\t\t\t<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512145338.htm</link>\r\n\t\t\t<description>New work has found material in rock formations that dates back to shortly after Earth formed.

A physicist would probably describe what is happening in terms of the particle nature of light. An atom or molecule in the fluorescent tube that is in an excited state spontaneously decays to a lower energy state, releasing a particle called a photon. When the photon enters your eye, something similar happens but in reverse. The photon is absorbed by a molecule in the retina and its energy kicks that molecule into an excited state. Light is both a particle and a wave, and this duality is fundamental to the physics that rule the Lilliputian world of atoms and molecules. Yet it would seem that in this case the wave nature of light can be safely ignored. Researcher might now give you an argument about that. <!-- more --></description>\r\n\t\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://images.sciencedaily.com/2016/05/160512142912.jpg\" height=\"298\" width=\"300\" />\r\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:29:12 EDT</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512142912.htm</guid>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t\t<title>Mice cooperate if they benefit</title>\r\n\t\t\t<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512142906.htm</link>\r\n\t\t\t<description>House mice often raise their offspring in a communal nest. A new study reveals that females tend to be more willing to raise their offspring cooperatively if they have similar litter sizes so that the investment is shared equally. As soon as the litter sizes differ, there are fewer communal nests. The mice therefore adjust their willingness to cooperate to the expected benefits. <!-- more --></description>\r\n\t\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://images.sciencedaily.com/2016/05/160512142906.jpg\" height=\"169\" width=\"300\" />\r\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:29:06 EDT</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512142906.htm</guid>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t\t<title>At Attention, Molecules!</title>\r\n\t\t\t<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512131738.htm</link>\r\n\t\t\t<description>Chemists have learned about a molecular assembly that may help create quicker, more responsive touch screens, among other applications.

One developer has created a new method by which dozens or even hundreds of search algorithms can be compared with each other simultaneously. This may mean that the best search algorithm can be selected faster than was previously possible. <!-- more --></description>\r\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 08:52:22 EDT</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085222.htm</guid>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t\t<title>Loneliness in midlife: Risk of becoming lonely is not limited to old age</title>\r\n\t\t\t<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085220.htm</link>\r\n\t\t\t<description>Investigators have been able to find out in which phases of our lives we are most at risk of becoming lonely. Their findings show that loneliness most often affects people in old age, beginning at approximately eighty. But there are also phases in midlife at which the risk is high. <!-- more --></description>\r\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 08:52:20 EDT</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085220.htm</guid>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t\t<title>Social engineering: Password in exchange for chocolate</title>\r\n\t\t\t<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085123.htm</link>\r\n\t\t\t<description>It requires a lot of effort and expense for computer hackers to program a Trojan virus and infiltrate individual or company computers. They are therefore increasingly relying on psychological strategies to manipulate computer users into voluntarily divulging their login details. These methods are known as \u201csocial engineering\u201d. For the first time, psychologists have conducted a large-scale study (involving 1,208 people) to investigate how people are manipulated into sharing their passwords with complete strangers in return for small gifts. <!-- more --></description>\r\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 08:51:23 EDT</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085123.htm</guid>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t\t<title>More urinary tract stones are being treated with surgery</title>\r\n\t\t\t<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085121.htm</link>\r\n\t\t\t<description>Researchers who analyzed recent trends related to urinary tract stones in the UK found a sustained and high prevalence of the condition, with an increased trend to treat patients with surgery. The number of upper urinary tract stone episodes in hospitals increased from 83,050 in 2009-2010 to 86,742 in 2014-2015. The use of non-invasive shock wave lithotripsy remained stable over this time; however, surgical intervention for stones in the ureter or kidney rose nearly 50% from 12,062 to 18,055 cases in the 5-year study period. <!-- more --></description>\r\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 08:51:21 EDT</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085121.htm</guid>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t\t<title>Research shows inaccuracies in emission measurements of important greenhouse gas nitrous oxide</title>\r\n\t\t\t<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085119.htm</link>\r\n\t\t\t<description>Nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane are the most important greenhouse gases. Nitrous oxide also participates in the destruction of stratospheric ozone. To mitigate global warming, we have to control nitrous oxide emissions. A recent study provides new knowledge on nitrous oxide emissions and shows that there can be significant inaccuracies in the traditional emission measurements. <!-- more --></description>\r\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 08:51:19 EDT</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085119.htm</guid>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t\t<title>Scientists develop new treatment to prolong life of those with cystic fibrosis</title>\r\n\t\t\t<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085117.htm</link>\r\n\t\t\t<description>A new molecule has been discovered that has the potential to prolong the life of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).

They found that kidneys that would normally be made available for transplantation were less likely to be procured from donors over the weekend (89.5% on the weekend vs. 90.2% during the week). Further, organs procured during the weekend were more than 20% more likely to be discarded than kidneys procured on other days, although the discarded kidneys were of higher quality on average than those discarded during the week, according to a new report. <!-- more --></description>\r\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 08:51:11 EDT</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512085111.htm</guid>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t\t<title>Benefits of calcium supplements may be outweighed by cardiovascular risks</title>\r\n\t\t\t<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512084911.htm</link>\r\n\t\t\t<description>Taking calcium and vitamin D can help prevent broken bones in older women.
