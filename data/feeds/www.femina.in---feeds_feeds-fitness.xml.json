You also  know that omega 3 is a wonderful happy hair nutrient, as it helps  condition the scalp from within. Also that vitamins: A, biotin and B 12  are holy grail for shiny, good looking shafts. But the super food in  this list that you probably don&rsquo;t know about is Soy. </strong></p>\r\n<p><img id=\"ed-img\" title=\"femina\" src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/inside_1448880369_640x640.jpg\" alt=\"femina\" width=\"640\" height=\"196\" /></p>\r\n<p>Research reveals that consuming soy milk and other soy products could actually help reduce hair loss. Yes, a solution available right there in your pantry, and every supermarket shelf. And although soy is not a magic bullet &ndash; it&rsquo;s not as if you&rsquo;ll go to sleep with sparse hair and get up with flowing hair &ndash; but eating soy products studies show clearly that not only strengthens the hair but also helps it to grow. That&rsquo;s because soy pro-tein helps to improve your hair's ability to retain moisture and isoflavones in it help prevent hair loss. Listen in future Rapunzels.<br /><br /><strong>Chomp it cues<br /></strong>Agreed soy can be a bit of an acquired taste but it&rsquo;s worth a try for the benefits. If you are wondering how to incorporate it in your daily diet, try these suggestions:<br /><br />Mix 2 large bananas, 2 cups chocolate soy milk and 1/4-cup soy nut butter in a blender until thoroughly smooth. Refrigerate and shake well before serving. <br />Combine mustard, honey, vinegar, turmeric, onion powder, celery seed and pepper in a small dish. Pour over crumbled tofu and mash together well. Add the celery and green pepper and mix well. Let it chill for a few hours to blend the flavours well.<br /><br /><strong>Or try the tofu ice-cream</strong> - Blend 16 0z soft tofu, 1 cup soy milk, half cup vegetable oil, one fourth cup cocoa, 1 tbsp vanilla essence and 1/8th tsp salt with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Freeze for a yummy, if a little unusual ice cream.<br />Hot tip&gt; replace milk with soy milk when you make soups &ndash; try with tomato, mushroom and carrot soup &ndash; the flavour blends well.<br /><br /><strong>What you always knew?<br /></strong>Soy is a low-carbohydrate source of high quality protein that gives satiety (meaning your appetite stays satisfied for longer and cravings are re-duced); it also stabilises blood sugars, which in turn helps balance the hormones that influence weight gain. Research also suggests that consum-ing soy protein may help protect bones from becoming weak and brittle and its antioxidants give it anti cancer properties too. Also there are some re-ports out about the heart health benefits it bestows. A complete win win, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree!</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:title type=\"html\">Kavita Devgan</media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/thumbnail_1448880346_201x160.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><femina:origLink>http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/save-your-hair-have-soy-4602.html</femina:origLink></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chocolates for your heart ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/chocolates-for-your-heart-4576.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/chocolates-for-your-heart-4576.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>2015-11-24 18:29:53</pubDate><dc:creator>Kavita Devgan</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/chocolates-for-your-heart-4576.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/chocolates-for-your-heart-4576.html\"><img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/thumbnail_1448370072_201x160.jpg\" /></a><p>Surprise, surprise!

Some chocolates can actually help boost your heart&rsquo;s health.</strong></p>\r\n<p><img id=\"ed-img\" title=\"health\" src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/shutterstock_269696057_1448370060_640x640.jpg\" alt=\"health\" width=\"640\" height=\"557\" /></p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the season for chocolates. After all even before the chocolate hampers that came as Diwali gifts finish, the Christmas hampers will begin to surface. Christmas and chocolates go really well together any ways, don&rsquo;t they. And no, you needn&rsquo;t worry about them being bad for you, some chocolates can actually help boost your heart&rsquo;s health. <br /><br />Our heart always knew it. Chocolates are good for the heart. And not just romantically speaking! Research into flavonoids, which are found in chocolate, has made it crystal clear that these antioxidants (flavon-oids) can be very beneficial for your heart. In fact, researchers have found that the flavonoids in dark chocolate (which include procyanid-ins, epicatechins, and catechins) are actually more effective antioxi-dants than those in other good sources like tea. Want to know how they work? Well, flavonoids improve the functioning of the endothe-lium, a layer of cells in arteries (including those in the heart) that pre-vents plaque build up and protects against high blood pressure. They basically prevent blood platelets from sticking together and causing clots, so keep our arteries healthy. Another study has reported that a substance in cocoa helps the body process nitric oxide (NO), a com-pound critical for healthy blood flow and blood pressure. In addition chocolates also contain phenolics, which again are considered to be heart healthy. So yes, you can go ahead and chomp the stash hidden in your drawers and also gift your loved ones this heart healthy gift: dark, creamy chocolate this Christmas minus any guilt.<br /><strong><br />Be careful though</strong><br />It is true that chocolate tends to be high in fat and sugar. But depend-ing on the kind of fat in the chocolate, it might not be too hard on your arteries. Good quality chocolates are made with cocoa butter, (heart healthy fat that has been shown to lower both total and LDL choles-terol). Remember, not all chocolate is made with cocoa butter, so be sure to read labels. Also practice portion control. Try to stick to about 100 calories of dark chocolate daily, adjusting your calorie intake and exercise appropriately. And remember you won&rsquo;t help your heart by gaining weight so although chocolate is good for you, but eat too much, and you might as well apply it directly to your hips. Alternately use cocoa powder (chocolate with much of the fat removed) to make hot chocolate, which by the way is a better idea as when warm the absorption and availability of these antioxidants multiplies exponen-tially (heat helps trigger release of more antioxidants.)<br /><strong><br />So, which is the healthiest chocolate?</strong><br />Remember darker the better. It's a fact that plain dark chocolate products containing 70% or more cocoa solids are the healthiest way to satisfy a craving for chocolate, without consuming too much sugar and saturated fat.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:title type=\"html\">Kavita Devgan</media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/thumbnail_1448370072_201x160.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><femina:origLink>http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/chocolates-for-your-heart-4576.html</femina:origLink></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get fitter in just 53 days ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/get-fitter-in-just-53-days-4575.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/get-fitter-in-just-53-days-4575.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>2015-11-24 18:01:14</pubDate><dc:creator>femina</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Videos]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.femina.in/fitness/get-fitter-in-just-53-days-4575.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/get-fitter-in-just-53-days-4575.html\"><img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/mm_2107_1448368586_1448368601_201x160.jpg\" /></a><p>Fitness guru Mickey Mehta shows you how you can get healthier and fitter in just 53 days.</p> <p><a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/get-fitter-in-just-53-days-4575.html\">Continue reading ...</a></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/mm_2107_1448368586_1448368601.jpg\" /> <p>Fitness guru Mickey Mehta shows you how you can get healthier and fitter in just 53 days.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:title type=\"html\">femina</media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/mm_2107_1448368586_1448368601_201x160.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><femina:origLink>http://www.femina.in/fitness/get-fitter-in-just-53-days-4575.html</femina:origLink></item><item><title><![CDATA[9 ways to prevent diabetes ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/9-ways-to-prevent-diabetes-4535.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/9-ways-to-prevent-diabetes-4535.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>2015-11-17 13:06:37</pubDate><dc:creator>Kavita Devgan</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/9-ways-to-prevent-diabetes-4535.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/9-ways-to-prevent-diabetes-4535.html\"><img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/thumbnail_1447745852_201x160.jpg\" /></a><p>This World Diabetes Day, learn how to prevent this common disease.</p> <p><a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/9-ways-to-prevent-diabetes-4535.html\">Continue reading ...</a></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/thumbnail_1447745852.jpg\" /> <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img id=\"ed-img\" title=\"FEMINA\" src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/inside_5_1447746169_640x640.jpg\" alt=\"FEMINA\" width=\"640\" height=\"649\" /></p>\r\n<p>Diabetes is an epidemic. There is absolutely no doubt about it. And an even bigger problem is that it is getting younger - with people even in their twenties now getting affected. November 14th every year is celebrated as World Diabetes Day, so this is a good time to learn how to prevent it. As it is, there is no cure for this disorder (it can only be managed), so prevention is definitely the better route to follow. Follow these 9 ways to keep it at bay:<br /><br />Maintain a healthy weight. Losing excess weight and maintaining a healthy body weight helps insulin work better in your body and that keeps blood sugar stable and the risk of pre diabetes (and thereon diabetes) low. In fact losing even 5-6 kgs delivers a much reduced risk.<br /><br />Have 3 main meals with 2 snacks in between. Keep your portions small. Handy tip for correct portion control: cereals and protein &ndash; the size of your palm (for example 1 medium size egg, 2 chapattis). Fill up the rest of the plate with vegetables and green leafy salad. <br /><br />Swap half of your white refined grains for whole grains, which deliver complex carbohydrates and are also a gold mine of nutrient and fibre. Try whole wheat, dalia, jowar, ragi, bajra, unpolished rice, amaranth. These breakdown more slowly to release glucose in blood and the presence of extra fibre also slow down the glucose absorption.<br /><br />Keep a tight lid on sugar intake, both table sugar as well as that hidden surreptitiously in processed foods. Learn to read the labels carefully and work deliberately to cut down your sweet tooth. Excess sugar indirectly leads to an increased risk for diabetes, so is best kept as ow as possible.<br /><br />Choose your oils carefully. Swap your dalda and butter for olive oil and vegetable oils (use a judicious mix of oils, changing every now and then to harness all their benefits)and get a steady and balanced supply of good mono unsaturated (MUFA) and poly unsaturated (PUFA) fats.<br /><br />Keep a tight watch on your numbers and control them consciously. Work toward lowering blood pressure and LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and boosting HDL (\"good\") cholesterol. Careful eating and regular exercise both help.<br /><br />Consciously try to reduce your stress levels. Stress is a major cause of many men now disorders, including diabetes. So learn to relax for some time each day. Keep some me time out, where you can listen to music, meditate or read. Yoga, meditation and tai-chi classes also help. <br /><br />Exercise for at least 30 minutes at least thrice a week; done even in&nbsp; three 10 minute bursts helps. Gardening, walking the dog, doing&nbsp; chores around the house&mdash;anything that's not sitting on the couch&nbsp; benefits your body by stimulating heart rate and circulation.<br /><br />Make an effort to stay happy. A positive, relaxed attitude goes a long way towards keeping diabetes at bay.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:title type=\"html\">Kavita Devgan</media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/thumbnail_1447745852_201x160.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><femina:origLink>http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/9-ways-to-prevent-diabetes-4535.html</femina:origLink></item><item><title><![CDATA[7 amazing benefits of coconut water ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/7-amazing-benefits-of-coconut-water-4510.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/7-amazing-benefits-of-coconut-water-4510.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>2015-11-09 17:47:22</pubDate><dc:creator>Kavita Devgan</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/7-amazing-benefits-of-coconut-water-4510.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/7-amazing-benefits-of-coconut-water-4510.html\"><img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/thumbnail_1447071799_201x160.jpg\" /></a><p>Diwali parties demand an ultimate hangover remedy.

And that&rsquo;s coconut  water if you ask me. Not only does it help hydrate effectively (alcohol  is extremely dehydrating), it also helps replace the lost electrolytes  (due to alcohol) and ease the bad effects of a bad hangover. But besides  this headache and nausea relieving benefit, there are enough other  reasons why I am a big fan of coconut water. This hydrating solution is  natural with no artificial additives or sweeteners, and honestly I have  yet to meet anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like it&rsquo;s sweet, nutty taste. By the way  it is quite nutritionally packed too. So a far better choice If you&rsquo;re  looking for a break from regular water, compared to any other drink,  sports drink loaded with excessive sugar included.<br /><br /><strong>Read on for it&rsquo;s benefits, which I hope will help bust any doubts that you have in mind regarding coconut water.<br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><img id=\"ed-img\" title=\"FEMINA\" src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/inside_1447071829_640x640.jpg\" alt=\"FEMINA\" width=\"640\" height=\"413\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>The calorie advantage: </strong>Most drinks that boast any kind of hydrating benefits are filled with calories and excess sugars to deliver that. Coconut water is a relatively low-calorie drink at around 45 calories per 240 ml<br /><br /><strong>Lots of potassium. </strong>It has more potassium than even a banana, so is a great option not just fro rehydration, but also to help tame the blood pressure. Potassium by the way is absolutely essential for the functioning of our nervous system and brain and to maintain muscle strength too.<br /><br /><strong>Multiple essential minerals. </strong>Besides many other, it delivers magnesium and copper, both of which are lacking in diets of most of us. Low magnesium levels can lead to extensive fatigue issues and it is also essential for maintaining strong teeth and bones, Without copper our organs and metabolism simply can't work efficiently.<br /><br /><strong>Arrest aging. </strong>Cytokins in coconut water have been found to have anti-ageing, and anti-carcinogenic effects. They balance pH levels, strengthen and hydrate connective tissues and even reduce the risk of age-related diseases.<br /><br /><strong>Antioxidants galore.&nbsp; </strong>Antioxidants absorb free radicals and toxins in our bodies.

I say you stay away from mundane,  useless stuff, and opt instead for something others will actually value.  Give something that&rsquo;ll help the health of your loved ones. Agreed dry  fruits make a wonderful health giving gift, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you  should give the same nuts as gifts every year &ndash; almonds, cashews and  pistas. This year gift a trio of walnuts, dried figs and dried  apri-cots. All three will add extra nutrition, flavour and crunch to the  meals of your loved ones, and they will hopefully snack on these  instead of high saturated fat cookies.</p>\r\n<p><img id=\"ed-img\" title=\"FEMINA\" src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/screen_shot_1446546212_640x640.jpg\" alt=\"FEMINA\" width=\"640\" height=\"324\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Gift them heart health with walnuts</strong><br />One of the best plant sources of protein, walnuts are rich in fibre, B vi-tamins, magnesium, and antioxidants such as vitamin E.&nbsp; They are also an excellent source of omega-3 essential fatty acids (this latest buzz word in healthy eating is a special type of protective fat the body cannot manufacture) - walnuts' concentration of omega-3s (a quarter-cup provides 90.8% of the daily value for these essential fats) offers cardiovascular protection, and better brain function; plus walnuts also contain an antioxidant compound called ellagic acid that supports the immune system and protects against cancer.<br /><br /><strong>Help control their blood pressure with dried figs</strong><br />Potassium in figs will help keep the BP down and lets face it most of us slack as far as this nutrient is concerned as we don&rsquo;t eat enough fruits and vegetables. Plus we also consume high amounts of sodium, so a little extra potassium will help balance the electrolytes in the body. There&rsquo;s more! It is rich in other minerals like calcium, magne-sium, iron and copper and is a good source of antioxidant vitamins A, E and K too. Figs have good amount of calcium, which helps to strengthen the bones and loads of fibre which helps keep our diges-tion hum along nicely.<br /><br /><strong>Protect their vision</strong><br />Apricots loaded with vitamin A, carotenoids and xanthophylls which protect the retina, so will help keep their vision in good shape. tIt also delivers vitamin C and a number of potent antioxidants like quercetin, proanthocyanidins, catechin, epicatechins and many more. These an-tioxidants also help get rid of free radicals produced in the body which, can damage the body on cellular level. Catechins in particular also help keep inflammation away. They are also rich in soluble fiber that dissolves easily in the body, this helps in absorbing essential nutri-ents. and keep one safe from gastrointestinal disorders. Finally it is a rich source of iron too, one of the rare good vegetarian sources.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:title type=\"html\">Kavita Devgan</media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Nov/thumbnail_1446546184_201x160.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><femina:origLink>http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/gift-of-health-this-diwali-4477.html</femina:origLink></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 benefits of eating pears ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/5-benefits-of-eating-pears-4444.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/5-benefits-of-eating-pears-4444.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>2015-10-27 17:24:24</pubDate><dc:creator>Kavita Devgan</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/5-benefits-of-eating-pears-4444.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/5-benefits-of-eating-pears-4444.html\"><img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/thumbnail_1445947060_201x160.jpg\" /></a><p>Find out how one of the most unsung healthy fruits around can help you get healthier.</p> <p><a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/5-benefits-of-eating-pears-4444.html\">Continue reading ...</a></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/thumbnail_1445947060.jpg\" /> <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img id=\"ed-img\" title=\"health\" src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/health_2_1445947152_640x640.jpg\" alt=\"health\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" /></p>\r\n<p>Known as butter fruit world over, pears (nashpati in our part of the  world) has a scrumptiously delicate flavour and melt in the mouth  texture. But that&rsquo;s not all that is good about this delicious fruit.  Apparently it is one of the most unsung healthy fruits around - one that  we must eat more of. I give you 5 solid reasons:<br /><br />A lot of studies have shown that regular consumption of pears actually help get the <strong>bad cholesterol down </strong>and thus help keep a lid on coronary heart diseases. They are loaded with flavonoids that help our body do that effectively. In fact one pear can provide half the total (14mg) flavonoids we need to stay healthy, so if you have two every day, you are sorted. By the way pears contain no cholesterol, no sodium and are free from saturated fat. In fact they are a good source of potassium (119 mg), which again helps in lowering blood pressure - good news again for our hearts. What a tasty way to take care of our heart!<br /><br />Pears are a <strong>great Vitamin C source, </strong>and C is an effective antioxidant which helps prevent free radical damage that pollution and eating too much junk food may lead to. Now by that i don&rsquo;t mean you have a burger and then a pear and think there I am good! But pears are definitely good to keep our body&rsquo;s immunity chugging along fine.<br /><br />Talking of taste&hellip; really I don&rsquo;t think I need to even talk about it&hellip;&nbsp; there is no doubt that it is delightfully juicy and has a fabulous &ldquo;melt in your mouth&rdquo; texture . Did you know that it has a nickname &ldquo;butter fruit&rdquo; world over. That&rsquo;s probably because levulose, the sweetest of all known sugars, is found much more in pears as compared to other fruits. They in fact have large amounts of natural fructose and glucose, making them a <strong>quick source of healthy energy. </strong>Diabetics too can also enjoy pears to satisfy their &ldquo;sweet tooth. In fact as they re a good source of fibre they actually help prevent diabetes.<br /><br />Now this one you have been waiting to hear I am sure&hellip; yes, besides all the above benefits pears are <strong>low in calories </strong>too, a medium size 100 gm pear provides just 60 calories and with it gives a good 3 grams of fibre. Even if you have a large year it&rsquo;&rsquo;l sill be just 100 calories and a whooping 5 grams of fibre. So it is a great weight loss tool and is perfect for snacking in this in between times.<br />&nbsp;<br />Pears are a <strong>fibre rich fruit, </strong>plus as their skin is tender and not bitter, they are usually eaten whole - which adds extensively to its fibre content. Fibre as we all know keeps our digestion chugging along well, helps reduce cholesterol levels and heart disease. Besides now we also know for sure that most of the health benefits and nutrients of fruits are concentrated in and just underneath the skin. So that&rsquo;s advantage pears again. Like apples, the antioxidant quercertin is found in the skin of pears, which may help prevent cancer and heart disease.<br /><br /><strong>Bite in: </strong>Eat as is, or chop and toss into salads to add a sweet flavor, or have them stewed with spices for a fancy dessert. Or poach it in wine - get a double dose of antioxidants.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:title type=\"html\">Kavita Devgan</media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/thumbnail_1445947060_201x160.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><femina:origLink>http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/5-benefits-of-eating-pears-4444.html</femina:origLink></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stress can make us unattractive ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/stress-can-make-us-unattractive-4443.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/stress-can-make-us-unattractive-4443.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>2015-10-27 17:21:06</pubDate><dc:creator>Upneet Pansare</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/stress-can-make-us-unattractive-4443.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/stress-can-make-us-unattractive-4443.html\"><img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/thumbnail_1445946783_201x160.jpg\" /></a><p>A new study has found that stress makes you ugly and unhealthy.</p> <p><a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/stress-can-make-us-unattractive-4443.html\">Continue reading ...</a></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/thumbnail_1445946783.jpg\" /> <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>It&rsquo;s time to introduce yoga and deep breathing exercises to your every day beauty regimen.

You might start appearing unattractive!<br /><br />A study conducted by British behavioural ecologist Dr Fhionna Moore has found that high levels of the hormone cortisol, produced when we&rsquo;re feeling pressurised, makes us appear uglier and less healthy. It increases the amount of glucose in the body while also inhibiting muscle and bone growth.<br /><br />Dr Fhionna said in an interview to Daily Mail, &ldquo;We believe that the link between low stress levels in men and high attractiveness to women is because an ability to handle stressful situations suggests a strong genetic make-up, the future suitability of a partner, and their ability to pass on &ldquo;good genes&rdquo; to their children.&rdquo;<br /><br />As part of her study, Dr Moore measured levels of cortisol from saliva samples and took photographs of the faces of participants. &ldquo;We found that the faces of men and women who had high levels of cortisol in their saliva were rated as less attractive and healthy than those with lower levels of cortisol&hellip;Although we haven't yet identified specific cues to stress in the face, it seems to come down to simply how 'healthy' someone looks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Here are ways in which you can beat stress<br /><a href=\"http://femina.in/fitness/health/3-musttry-stressbusters-3824.html\" target=\"_blank\">3 must-try stressbusters</a><br /><a href=\"http://femina.in/fitness/health/stressed-switch-off-your-tv-2895.html\" target=\"_blank\">Is your TV the reason behind your increased stress levels?</a><br /><a href=\"http://femina.in/lifestyle/food/destress-with-these-foods-2737.html\" target=\"_blank\">Foods that help you de-stress</a><br /><a href=\"http://femina.in/fitness/health/5-ways-to-beat-everyday-stress-1181.html\" target=\"_blank\">5 ways to beat daily stress</a><br /><a href=\"http://femina.in/lifestyle/careers/the-most-stressful-jobs-2169.html\" target=\"_blank\">Stay away from these jobs to avoid stress</a><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:title type=\"html\">Upneet Pansare</media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/thumbnail_1445946783_201x160.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><femina:origLink>http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/stress-can-make-us-unattractive-4443.html</femina:origLink></item><item><title><![CDATA[7 early signs of breast cancer ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/7-early-signs-of-breast-cancer-4389.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/7-early-signs-of-breast-cancer-4389.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>2015-10-26 03:35:21</pubDate><dc:creator>Deepa Suryanarayan</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Articles]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/7-early-signs-of-breast-cancer-4389.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/7-early-signs-of-breast-cancer-4389.html\"><img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/thumbnail_1444991516_201x160.jpg\" /></a><p>Why there's an urgent need for a breast cancer awareness programme in India.</p> <p><a href = \"http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/7-early-signs-of-breast-cancer-4389.html\">Continue reading ...</a></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/thumbnail_1444991516.jpg\" /> <p><strong>Dr Ragini Agrawal, director of W-Hospital by Pratiksha, specialty hospital for women in Gurgaon, tells us why a breast cancer awareness programme on the lines of the Government&rsquo;s polio eradication programme, is the need of the hour. (</strong><strong>October is observed as the Breast Cancer Awareness month the world over.)<br /> <br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><img id=\"ed-img\" title=\"FEMINA\" src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/1_main_1444991549_640x640.jpg\" alt=\"FEMINA\" width=\"640\" height=\"519\" /></p>\r\n<p><em>&lsquo;There can be life after breast cancer. The prerequisite is early detection.&rsquo; -- Ann Jillian<br /></em><br />Breast cancer is now the most common cancer in Indian women, accounting for 25-30 % of all cancers in women across the country. Every year almost 80.000 women die of breast cancer in India, the highest in whole world. Cancer causes a huge emotional and economic burden on society. A recent study of breast cancer risk in India revealed that one in 28 women develops breast cancer during her lifetime. This is higher in urban areas (one in 22) compared to rural areas, where the risk is lower at one in 60 women.<br /><br /><strong>Younger women at risk in India</strong><br />Breast cancer is found in younger women around the 30-40 age group, while it is commonly seen in 50+ women in the West. In India, in the last two decades there has been a shift towards younger women -- almost 48% patients are below the age of 50. This is definitely a very disturbing trend. And almost 60% patient do not survive due to diagnosis in stage 3 or 4. The disease in younger women is aggressive and usually not sensitive to chemotherapy. Breast cancer awareness campaign should be taken as national programme like polio, so that it can be detected in the early stage, in the asymptomatic phase when it is still in Stage 1 and post treatment survival rate is good. <br /><br />Almost 6 to 8% of breast cancers will be hereditary, and will be passed down the family. Your genes determine your risk for developing certain cancers due to a change in the genetic material (called as a germ-line mutation) , or DNA and predisposition to developing cancer. If any member of your family suffers from a type of cancer or another, it is an indication that there may be inherited predisposition to cancer, and you will be in the high risk category for cancer diagnosis. The key to early detection is breast awareness programme. Education, examination and screening tool like mammography and breast ultrasound. Along with these screening tests lifestyle modification also plays a role.</p>\r\n<p><img id=\"ed-img\" title=\"FEMINA\" src=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/2_1444991568_640x640.jpg\" alt=\"FEMINA\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" /></p>\r\n<p><em>Photograph: Dr Ragini Agrawal</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>7 things to watch out for </strong><br /><br /><strong>--&gt; </strong>Any lump in breast.

But just so that you don&rsquo;t go back to skipping the yolk and eating only the whites, I am writing this post to convince you why eating the omelette minus the yellow is a big-big mistake. In any case, egg yolks have been facing flak for too long now, so it&rsquo;s time to chaff the fluff from the real truth. <strong>Here are four reasons why you must have the yellow goodness:<br /></strong><br />While most of us associate the super healthy carotenoids with vegetables, egg yolks are actually a very <strong>good source of lutein and zeaxanthin</strong>,<strong> </strong>two carotenoids, which are crucial for eye health. These protect the eye from damage caused by ultraviolet light, and studies have shown that their high dietary intake also leads to a significant reduction in the risk for cataract and age-related Macular Degeneration (which eventually leads to blindness). Wow, a one stop food for your eyes!<br /><br /><strong>Yolks provide us with choline</strong>, which is a dietary component essential for normal function of all cells. Yes, it is that important! It leads to improved brain functioning and greater lifelong memory capabilities. Big bonus!<br /><br />It also has a less known <strong>compound called betaine, </strong>which helps reduce levels of homocysteine in the blood. Elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations are considered a big risk factor for cardiac disease. So eggs actually help cut down the risk for heart disease. <br /><br />Finally the fear about the <strong>fat content in the yolks is totally unfounded. </strong>In fact, half the fat in the yolk isn&rsquo;t even saturated. Besides saturated fat is not a devil anymore if we go by latest research. Cholesterol content in it is not so much of an issue too, unless you already have a cholesterol problem. Then too yolk in moderation is perfectly fine.<br /><br />So unless you are allergic to eggs, you should eat them regularly.<br /><br /><strong>Get the power<br /></strong>Slice a hard-cooked egg, and add to a salad; keep hard-cooked eggs on hand for a quick snack or breakfast on the go; mix chopped up hard boiled eggs with fresh lemon juice and olive oil and leeks to make a healthy egg salad; place a poached egg on top of a toast lined with steamed spinach. Top with salsa. Yum!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:title type=\"html\">Kavita Devgan</media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://www.femina.in/media/content/2015/Oct/thumbnail_1445332056_201x160.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><femina:origLink>http://www.femina.in/fitness/health/egg-yolk-good-or-bad-for-you-4406.html</femina:origLink></item></channel></rss>",
