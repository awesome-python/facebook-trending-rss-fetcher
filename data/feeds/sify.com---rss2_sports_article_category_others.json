It bought smaller Ashworth in 2008 and Adams four years later.</p>  <p>The golf business achieved sales of 902 million euros ($1.04 billion) last year, accounting for about 5 percent of group sales and down by a third from a peak of 1.34 billion euros in 2012. The part of the business it is selling accounts for 60  percent of total golf-related revenue. </p>  <p>Analysts predict the business might draw interest from companies in Asia or a financial investor, rather than a rival such as Nike, Puma, Under Armour or Callaway Golf, which might be wary of increased exposure to golf.</p>  <p>Several private equity firms have looked at the business and decided against a bid, citing its losses and the sport's waning popularity, sources close to the companies have told Reuters. </p>  <p/>  <p>U.S. LEAP</p>  <p>Adidas made the announcement as it reported a 31 percent jump in quarterly sales of its core brand in North America, as a rise in marketing spend helped it to gain ground on rivals.</p>  <p>Adidas shares, which soared to a record high last week when it released strong headline quarterly figures and raised its 2016 outlook, were down 0.6 percent at 1508 GMT, against a 0.8 percent decline for the German blue-chip index.</p>  <p>Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said growth was driven by both fashion products such as its retro Stan Smith sneakers and training gear including its springy Boost running shoes, with U.S. sports gear sales up 50 percent in the quarter.</p>  <p>Total Adidas brand sales rose 26 percent, far outperforming the 6 percent of its Reebok fitness label, which some investors hope might also be put up for sale after Hainer is replaced as CEO by former Henkel boss Kasper Rorsted in October.</p>  <p>Hainer reiterated his desire to hang on to Reebok, citing a booming fitness market.</p>  <p>TaylorMade sales returned to growth in the quarter, rising 6 percent, while Adidas golf sales were up 3 percent. But that failed to make up for double-digit declines at Ashworth and Adams.</p>  <p>Hainer said the unit is still making a small loss overall but is improving quarter to quarter.</p>  <p>($1 = 0.8702 euros)</p>  <p/>  <p> (Additional reporting by Lauren Hirsch; Editing by David Goodman)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/adidas-seeks-buyer-for-golf-businesses-to-focus-on-shoes-clothing-news-equity-qfeogpbfhched.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/news/india-asks-uk-to-deport-embattled-tycoon-vijay-mallya-news-crime-qe2sfJeacahai.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 28 Apr 2016 12:35:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[India asks UK to deport embattled tycoon Vijay Mallya]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India said on Thursday it had asked Britain to deport Vijay Mallya, the liquor tycoon who flew to London last month as bankers pressed him to repay about $1.4 billion owed by his defunct Kingfisher Airlines.</p>  <p>The Ministry of External Affairs has written to the British High Commission seeking Mallya's return so that \"his presence can be secured for investigations against him\" under India's anti-moneylaundering law, spokesman Vikas Swarup told reporters.</p>  <p>The liquor tycoon and Formula 1 boss has not disclosed his whereabouts since flying first class from Delhi to London on March 2, leaving the Indian government and bankers red faced as they try to crack down on high-profile defaulters.</p>  <p>The foreign ministry last Sunday revoked Mallya's diplomatic passport that he carried as a member of parliament's upper house. The move was a step towards launching a bid to bring home Mallya, who is the subject of a non-bailable warrant issued by a special judge in Mumbai.</p>  <p>The Enforcement Directorate, a government agency set up to fight financial crime, has accused Mallya's UB Group of using 4.3 billion rupees ($64.5 million) of bank loans to Kingfisher to buy property overseas.</p>  <p>Creditors, led by State Bank of India <SBI.NS>, have rejected an offer of partial repayment by Mallya, who had given a personal guarantee for the Kingfisher loan. They have demanded that the former billionaire attend a hearing in India's Supreme Court.</p>  <p>Mallya, traced by Indian reporters to a country residence in Hertfordshire, has said he would comply with the law. </p>  <p>The British Home Office, which adjudicates in such cases, declined to comment. A spokesman said its policy was neither to confirm nor deny that extradition requests have been made.</p>  <p/>  <p> (Reporting by Krishna N.

Apart from being the first Indian woman, she will also be the first Indian gymnast qualifying for the quadrennial extravaganza after 52 long years.</p><p>Since India's independence, 11 Indian male gymnast have taken part in the Olympics (two in 1952, three in 1956 and six in 1964) but this will be a first for an Indian woman at the Olympics. The International Federation of Gymnastics (Federation Internationale de Gymnastique) has confirmed Dipa's Rio Games qualification in its official release.</p><p>\"Following the Women's Qualification Competition at the Gymnastics Test Event in Rio, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) herewith confirms the list of nations and individual gymnasts that have qualified for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games,\" the world body said in its release. Dipa has been listed as the 79th gymnast among individual qualifiers in the list of women's artistic gymnast who have qualified for the Rio Olympics.</p><p>Her first vault, the much difficult Produnova, gave Dipa 15.066 points, the highest among the 14 competitors. But a poor show in the uneven bars took her points down as she collected 11.700, the second worst among the 14 participants.</p><p>The Tripura girl secured 13.366 and 12.566 points in beam and floor exercises. Deepak Kagra, an international referee, said that after's Dipa's strong performance it was certain that she would qualify for Rio Olympics.</p><p>\"It was a very good score from Dipa and we were certain that she would qualify. Now the world body has published the names of the gymnasts who have qualified for the Olympics and her name is there. The gymnastics community is proud of Dipa's achievements,\" he said.</p><p>The 22-year-old could not clinch an Olympic berth in the World Championships in November last as she finished outside the podium (fifth place). She was earlier named as second reserve for the ongoing Olympic Test event in Rio but was informed last month that she had sneaked into the shortlist of participants.</p><p>Dipa had created history by becoming the first woman gymnast to win a medal - a bronze - in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014. She then became the first Indian woman gymnast to feature in the finals of World Championships in November last.</p><p>The sport of gymnastics has been in turmoil in the country in the the last few years with rival factions holding elections and claiming to be the national federation. Even the camps for the gymnasts has been held under the aegis of Sports Authority of India.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BBC News - Indian gymnast's dangerous leap for success <a href=\"https://t.co/KRaiX117VT\">https://t.co/KRaiX117VT</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DipaKarmakar?src=hash\">#DipaKarmakar</a></p>\u2014 Ryan Mandrake (@RyanMandrake) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RyanMandrake/status/706791562521481216\">March 7, 2016</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Congratulations Dipa Karmakar.

We cannot do our job without this. We cannot deliver. We are being asked to make very significant changes, by changing the driveability of the tyres.\"</p>  <p>Hembery and the FIA were not immediately available for comment. </p>  <p>Motorsport.com said Pirelli had written to the FIA earlier in April to make clear that it would withdraw from the 2017-19 contract if the test programme was not sorted immediately.</p>  <p>The website said FIA race director Charlie Whiting had recently visited senior Pirelli representatives in Milan to  push the testing agreement forward.</p>  <p>It added, however, that an agreement had been reached in Shanghai, during the weekend's third round of the championship, for five teams to join a programme to run from July for a period of 25 car days.</p>  <p>\"There are big changes happening.

(Reuters) - Force India are waiting for Formula One's 2017 rules to be finalised before taking the next step in their complaint to the European Union about how the sport is run and revenues distributed.</p>  <p>\"We're not looking at moving that forward until the end of the month, until we've seen all the changes that come in and we know exactly where things are,\" deputy team principal Bob Fernley told Reuters.</p>  <p>Force India, controlled by Indian magnate Vijay Mallya, and Swiss rivals Sauber filed a joint complaint last September asking the EU competition authorities to investigate the sport's governance.</p>  <p>Both teams believe Formula One is in breach of articles that prohibit cartels and the abuse of dominant market positions.</p>  <p>At stake is the amount of money top teams like Ferrari receive from the commercial rights holder as well as their influence on decision making, with the possibility that contracts will have to be redrawn.</p>  <p>\"We submitted our complaint. The complaint has then gone to CVC (commercial rights holders). CVC have responded back (to the EU), which we have a copy of, and then we have to reply again to that final part of it,\" Fernley said.</p>  <p>\"Then they'll look at it. It's going through the process.\"</p>  <p>The sport's core Strategy Group of governing body, six top teams and commercial rights holder agreed in February to postpone to April 30 the deadline for finalisation of the 2017 sporting and technical regulations.</p>  <p/>  <p>QUESTIONABLE CARTEL</p>  <p>The rules can be decided by majority vote, even though after March 1 any changes for 2017 would normally have to be agreed unanimously, because the postponement was approved on those terms.</p>  <p>Force India and Sauber argue that the Strategy group amounts to a \"questionable cartel\". A briefing note issued after the formal complaint to the EU spoke of \"unfair\" side payments and \"unlawful practices\".</p>  <p>Top teams Mercedes, Ferrari, McLaren, Williams and Red Bull receive special payments in recognition of past performance and sit permanently with the commercial rights holder and governing FIA on the Strategy Group.</p>  <p>The sixth team is decided by championship standings and is currently Force India.</p>  <p>The smaller teams say the system is skewed in favour of the big ones, who are guaranteed millions of dollars regardless of how they perform on the track and also get to decide the rules.</p>  <p>Commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone last year dismissed talk of a cartel but is now questioning the influence of dominant champions Mercedes and Ferrari -- who between them supply eight of the 11 teams with engines.</p>  <p>Current contracts with the teams and governing FIA run to 2020 but Ecclestone has indicated he would welcome the chance to rip them up and start again.</p>  <p>Speaking to reporters at last weekend's Bahrain Grand Prix, Ecclestone suggested the EU was \"starting to get more and more interested in the anti-competitive way that we've got.</p>  <p>\"If the EU got really excited about it, they could look at it (the existing contracts) and say 'You've got to tear that up',\" he added.

Andresen.</p>  <p>The ethics panel will also look into allegations of human rights abuses in Qatar's building sector, Malaysia's electronics goods industry, and textile factories in some Asian countries, Andresen told Reuters.</p>  <p>The fund is the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, owning 1.3 percent of all listed company equity on earth. As of the end of last year it owned shares in 9,050 firms worldwide.</p>  <p>It is forbidden by law from investing in firms that produce nuclear weapons or anti-personnel landmines, or are involved in serious and systematic human rights violations, among other ethical criteria.</p>  <p>Norway's parliament has set a new mandate from this year to restrict investment in companies that emit excessive climate changing gases. Andresen said his panel was still looking into the criteria for such judgements but its first recommendations on climate criteria could come by the end of the year.</p>  <p>Some 66 companies have so far been excluded from the wealth fund on ethics grounds, and two are under observation, including, since January, Brazil's state oil company Petrobras, under scrutiny for alleged corruption.</p>  <p>\"Most of the corruption cases come from the industry studies within defence, telecoms and energy. Those three (sectors) seem to keep us very busy,\" Andresen, the council's chairman, said in an interview. \"We will of course look into other companies, should we be made aware of them.\"</p>  <p>The Council on Ethics makes recommendations to the central bank on firms which may be in breach of the fund's ethics guidelines. It is now examining 14 corruption cases, including Petrobras.</p>  <p>Based on the council's recommendations, the central bank board instructs the fund's management whether to exclude companies from the fund. The board can also put firms under observation to allow them to fix the problem. A key factor is the risk that an ethics breach will be repeated in future. </p>  <p>The risk of corruption increases in the energy, defence and telecoms sectors as they more often involve large contracts between parties that can withhold information based on internal national security directives, Andresen said.</p>  <p>\"We were especially surprised with what we found in the arms industry. It seems that the absence of corruption was the exception and not the norm,\" said the 54-year-old Norwegian investor, owner of private investment vehicle Ferd.</p>  <p>Andresen declined to comment specifically on Petrobras, but speaking generally, he said: \"Companies should aspire to be far better ... They should not try to guess what is the least amount of good behaviour that is expected.\"</p>  <p>Across all sectors, he expected the number and frequency of recommendations to the central bank's board to increase as the council concludes the different sector studies it has begun.</p>  <p>\"We did recommend one company for exclusion last week, and there are others that we are working on right now. Some of these companies are quite large, so the (central) bank may decide to undertake some type of ownership interaction,\" he said.</p>  <p/>  <p>TEXTILE, CONSTRUCTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE</p>  <p>Asked about the apparent irony in looking at climate change for a fund that earns nearly all its wealth from Norway's oil and gas industry, Andresen said: \"We don't get involved in politics and therefore we don't question the criteria. Whichever criteria the politicians give us, we will use.\" </p>  <p>Andresen said the council would look at \"a broad set of industries\" including the oil and gas sector over climate change, and had not yet concluded which factors to analyse to determine what is acceptable.     </p>  <p>\"I don't think there is a reason to avoid looking at oil and gas companies. But they are not going to be the only ones by far,\" he said, speaking at the council's office in central Oslo.</p>  <p>\"We think that there might be some exclusions towards the end of the year within the climate criterion.\"</p>  <p>Next month the council will receive a first report on the construction industry in Qatar. Construction companies working in neighbouring countries will be under review too, he said.</p>  <p>Also under scrutiny will be electronics goods manufacturers in Malaysia.</p>  <p>The council will look at workers rights in the Indian and Bangladeshi textile industries, after looking at Cambodia and Vietnam last year.</p>  <p>\"In earlier studies of textile production facilities, we have been confronted with forced overtime, loss of bonus when legally sick, possible child labour, safety issues and the integrity of the construction of the (plant) building,\" he said.</p>  <p>Another target will be the environmental damage made by the chemical industry. The council is looking at \"less than ten\" companies in this field, he said.</p>  <p>The council, although independent, is collaborating closely with the fund, which has its own ethical targets, such as children's rights, human rights and water management. They are working together on the textile industry.</p>  <p>\"They are focusing on the buyers' side, the big companies within the fund, while we engage with the smaller companies where the potential breach is happening on the ground,\" he said.</p>  <p/>  <p> (Editing by Peter Graff)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/exclusive-ethics-watchdog-for-norways-830-billion-wealth-fund-sees-increase-in-bans-on-firms-news-others-qdlqxUcjcbhjh.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/mclaren-automotive-could-triple-car-production-by-2022---ceo-news-others-qdcfcedicgagi.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Tue, 01 Mar 2016 23:32:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[McLaren Automotive could triple car production by 2022 - CEO]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>By Costas Pitas</p>  <p>GENEVA (Reuters) - McLaren Automotive, which only began building its range of luxury sports cars for general sale in 2010, could triple volumes to up to 5,000 cars by 2022, its CEO told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>  <p>The small luxury sports car manufacturer, which unveiled its 570 GT model at the Geneva Motor Show on Tuesday, has been ramping up production in recent years and built 1,654 cars in 2015, with prices ranging from about 120,000 pounds ($167,600) to more than 800,000 pounds.</p>  <p>But CEO Mike Flewitt said an increase in numbers will come from its widened range of seven models, with the new 570 GT being part of its plan to broaden the brand's appeal to new types of buyers, including more women.</p>  <p>\"4,000 (vehicles) is a very good business model for us. I actually think volume by 2022 will be more consistently around 4,500 and I don't think it will go above 5,000 cars,\" he said. </p>  <p>McLaren, which shares facilities and expertise with its Formula One namesake but is a separate legal entity, is expanding in a market segment that longer-established rivals such as Ferrari <RACE.MI> and Aston Martin have traditionally dominated.</p>  <p>However, some smaller companies have been held back by not being part of a wider automotive group. Aston Martin has tried to counter the problem by using a partnership with larger brand Daimler <DAIGn.DE> to supply some electronics and engines. </p>  <p>Meeting stricter and costlier emissions rules is also seen as a challenge to smaller carmakers, but McLaren's global director of sales and marketing said the company does not need to be part of a wider group.</p>  <p>\"Last year we invested 120 million pounds ($167.7 million) in research and development.

Nepal's infrastructure was badly hit in the quakes and a prolonged transport blockade along the border with India over a political dispute has further hit supplies of fuel and equipment.

No vaccine has been developed so far.</p>  <p>One of the possible vaccines is \"recombinant\", which means it is created by genetic engineering, while the other was \"inactivated\", and will enter pre-clinical trials in animals in two weeks, Bharat Biotech managing director Krishna Ella told Reuters. </p>  <p>An inactivated vaccine is created by killing a pathogen in a way that its ability to replicate is destroyed, but the immune system can still recognise it.</p>  <p>Bharat Biotech's announcement came a day after France's Sanofi said it had launched a project to develop a Zika vaccine. On Wednesday, Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical also said it was investigating the possibilities of developing a vaccine for the disease.</p>  <p>Privately held Bharat Biotech, based in Hyderabad, said it started work on the Zika virus a year ago, while developing vaccines for chikungunya and dengue. Zika is closely related to dengue and is spread by the same species of mosquito. </p>  <p>Bharat Biotech sells its vaccines for polio, hepatitis B, H1N1 and rabies, among others, to more than 65 countries, according to its website. </p>  <p>\"They've got a lead, essentially ... it's certainly not a vaccine yet,\" said Soumya Swaminathan, the Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the apex body for biomedical research in India, funded by the health ministry.</p>  <p>Swaminathan said it was premature to comment on the two vaccine candidates, but the ICMR had put together a group of experts to examine their validity.</p>  <p>No cases of the virus have been detected in India yet, but the health ministry on Tuesday issued guidelines on the disease, including an advisory that travel to affected countries be postponed or cancelled.</p>  <p/>  <p> (Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in Mumbai; Editing by Nick Macfie)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/bharat-biotech-says-working-on-two-possible-zika-vaccines-news-others-qcdqdNciejhij.html]]></link></item></channel></rss>",
