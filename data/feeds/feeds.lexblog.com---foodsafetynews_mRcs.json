It means that for $25 or $50 DNA fingerprints can be isolated from smaller samples.</p>\n<p>Wiedmann, Cornell\u2019s Gellert Family Professor of Food Safety, said whole genome sequencing has been used as a detection tool by CDC in several recent Listeria outbreaks, including those\u00a0associated with Blue Bell ice cream, Haroun Dairies soft cheese, Dole packaged salads and others.</p>\n<p>Foodborne illness investigators have been relying on DNA fingerprinting for about 20 years, but traditionally those have been obtained through pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, also known as PFGE. Whole genome sequencing, or WGS, produces DNA fingerprinting that is more detailed and more likely to identify sources of outbreaks of enteric illnesses.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_126249\" style=\"width: 416px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2016/05/Martin-Wiedmann.jpg\"><img class=\"hello\" style=\"display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;\"class=\"wp-image-126249 size-full\" src=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2016/05/Martin-Wiedmann.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Wiedmann\" width=\"406\" height=\"250\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Martin Wiedmann, Cornell\u2019s Gellert Family Professor of Food Safety, in his lab. <em>(Photo courtesy of Cornell)</em></p></div>\n<p>The practical implication of more WGS testing will be more detection of more outbreaks, according to Wiedmann. Tauxe said the roll out of the technology to the state labs will require the launch of PulseNet 2.0 for handling the WGS data. PulseNet is the 20-year old system connecting laboratories working with CDC for sharing and sub-typing DNA \u201cfingerprints.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wiedmann said that while Listeria is often referred to as being ubiquitous in the environment, food plant managers must stop thinking that the pathogen cannot be eliminated from their facilities.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt cannot have a niche, it cannot have places in your plant where it can survive,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Cornell University researchers have found Listeria is ubiquitous in the environment, ranging from 1.3 percent to 8 percent in samples from New York state parks to 20 percent to 30 percent of samples taken from farm land.</p>\n<p>Next to that, Listeria\u2019s long incubation period that can extend from a week to 60 days or more is a problem for food safety investigators, the Cornell professor said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to remember all that you\u2019ve eaten going back for two months,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>In response to a question about the future, Tauxe predicted whole genome sequencing might eventually be used to determine what an ill person has eaten as well.</p>\n<p>Wiedmann predicts the shift to whole genome sequencing will mean\u00a030-times more detections of Listeria outbreaks. \u201cWe need to up our game,\u201d he said in reference to the food industry. \u201cOur ability to detect an outbreak has increased (from) 50 to 100 times in 20 years.&#8221; He said what is needed in food plants to combat Listeria is persistence.</p>\n<p>Too many, he said, have \u201chouse bugs and pet Listeria.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steven Tsuyuki, senior director for corporate sanitation and sanitary design for Canada\u2019s Maple Foods, said the 2008 Listeria outbreak associated with his company almost put them out of business. It was one of the most deadly outbreaks in Canadian history, resulting in at least 23 deaths. In the years since, he said Maple Leaf has cut the number of facilities in half as it worked to design production lines and equipment to control Liseria.</p>\n<p><b><i>(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click</i></b><b><i> </i></b><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VtY2Ysdln_R\"><b><i>here</i></b></a><b><i>.)</i></b></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/FvfdP_ofutE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/cdc-sending-states-new-outbreak-tool-launching-pulsenet-2-0/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/cdc-sending-states-new-outbreak-tool-launching-pulsenet-2-0/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>The future is now for America\u2019s food safety programs</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~3/hpvP97-AMkI/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/the-future-is-now-for-food-safety-in-america/#comments</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 05:00:04 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Coral Beach]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food Policy & Law]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food Safety Leaders]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Foodborne Illness Investigations]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Government Agencies]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science & Research]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016 Food Safety Summit]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FDA]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[foodborne illness outbreaks]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FSIS]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FSMA]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Joseph Corby]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Michael Taylor]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[outbreak investigations]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Robert Tauxe]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[USDA]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.foodsafetynews.com/?p=126252</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[CHICAGO \u2014 Optimism was running high at the Food Safety Summit Thursday when four heavy hitters took the stage for a town hall session where 2016 was characterized as a tipping point.

Tauxe said with the application of whole genome sequencing \u2014 which sorts through the 3 million DNA \u201cletters\u201d in any given Listeria sample \u2014 the CDC is identifying and solving outbreaks faster.</p>\n<p>Before it began using whole genome sequencing, the CDC was \u201csolving\u201d about two outbreaks a year, Tauxe said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn 2015 we solved nine outbreaks and we identified outbreaks faster, which means we stopped them earlier,\u201d Tauxe said.</p>\n<p>This year the agency plans to rollout whole genome sequencing (WGS) to 30 states, with the rest of the country to be online with the technique in two years.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe may look back on 2016 as a tipping point in food safety,\u201d Tauxe said, adding that the CDC has a goal of decreasing Salmonella infections by 20 percent in the next five years.</p>\n<p>The other panelists at the town hall event shared similar hopes and goals.</p>\n<p><b>USDA\u2019s perspective<br />\n</b>The modernization of meat, poultry and egg inspections has been in the works for 20 years, said David Goldman, assistant administrator for the office of public health science for the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to publish a new strategic plan for fiscal year 2017,\u201d Goldman said, adding that the introduction of new standards in the coming two years is expected to\u00a0result in 50,000 fewer foodborne illnesses annually.</p>\n<p>Goldman said some gaps in USDA\u2019s testing are being tightened up. For example, instead of testing only whole carcasses federal inspectors will begin sampling individual cuts of meat. The agency also plans to begin testing food products that include meat and poultry, such as pot pies and other products.</p>\n<p><b>Information sharing<br />\n</b>Joe Corby has been watching the movement to integrate America\u2019s food safety system since 1989. Now, as executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials (AFDO), Corby sees light at the end of the tunnel.</p>\n<p>\u201cLocal, state and federal labs and officials are sharing information now,\u201d Corby said. \u201cSome individual leaders of \u2018empires\u2019 weren\u2019t willing to cooperate like that back in those early days. It\u2019s no longer the 1990s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Corby said 31 state labs are now accredited and 20 states have active rapid response teams to investigate foodborne illness outbreaks. But, Corby warned that the food industry and other stakeholders need to keep the momentum going.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have convinced industry and consumers but we need to turn our focus to state and federal legislators,\u201d Corby said. \u201cIf they decrease funding now it could initiate a collapse of the efforts and progress so far.\u201d</p>\n<p><b>The view from the \u2018lame duck\u2019<br />\n</b>The final panelist to address the town hall gathering of more than 1,000 food safety professionals was Michael Taylor, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the lame duck on the stage,\u201d Taylor said at the opening of his remarks, referring to his planned departure from his FDA post next month.</p>\n<p>Taylor has been at the helm of the FDA\u2019s Office of Foods since January 2010, just months after the office was created in August 2009. Charged with developing a prevention-based strategy for food safety, Taylor has been focused on preparing FDA and the food industry for the realities of the implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are keenly aware that the hard part is still ahead,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cTo accomplish the vision of FSMA we need to turn ideas we agree on into science-based practices.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the past five years Taylor presided over the development of rules mandated by FSMA that are designed to turn food safety in America away from reaction and toward prevention. He said he believes the change will have worldwide impact.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt may take five or 10 years but translating these ideas into practices on a global scale is the future of food safety,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p><b><i>(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click</i></b><b><i> </i></b><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VtY2Ysdln_R\"><b><i>here</i></b></a><b><i>.)</i></b></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/hpvP97-AMkI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/the-future-is-now-for-food-safety-in-america/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/the-future-is-now-for-food-safety-in-america/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Collaboration common theme among food safety honorees</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~3/RVeY35wMDBs/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/collaboration-common-theme-among-food-safety-honorees/#comments</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:29:21 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Coral Beach]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Events]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food Safety Leaders]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science & Research]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016 Food Safety Summit]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Dr. Judy Harrison]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[food safety education]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[John Butts]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NSF International]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Purnendu C.

Vasavada; and presenter Lori Stephens of NSF International.</p></div>\n<p>The annual Food Safety Leadership Award for Training and Education went to Judy A. Harrison, professor and Extension food safety specialist at the University of Georgia\u2019s Department of Foods and Nutrition.</p>\n<p>NSF International, a global public health and safety organization that provides food safety and quality assurance services across all food supply chain sectors, presents the awards to recognize individuals and organizations for real and lasting improvements in food safety.</p>\n<p>Now in its thirteenth year, the awards program encourages innovation in educational programs, processes and technologies to advance food safety.</p>\n<p>Each year, an independent panel of food safety experts from academia, industry and the regulatory community reviews nominations from around the world to select the recipients. Nominations are evaluated on the basis of innovation, design and contribution to the advancement of food safety.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe work of John Butts, Purnendu Vasavada and Judy Harrison has contributed to important advances in food safety innovation, pathogen mitigation, education and training, NSF president and CEO Kevan Lawlor said.</p>\n<p>\u201cTheir leadership and enthusiasm in applying science-based methods, sharing information across the industry, collaborating and training to help solve vital food safety issues embodies the spirit of NSF International\u2019s Food Safety Leadership Awards.\u201d</p>\n<p><b>John R. Butts<br />\n</b>A food safety advocate and food processing scientist, Butts has more than 40 years of experience creating food protection solutions such as improved sanitation and sanitary design of facilities and equipment, pathogen intervention, process control and risk assessment.</p>\n<p>He has helped food companies integrate scientific principles and food technology in real-world manufacturing settings to help enhance food safety, assure product quality and deliver efficient solutions.</p>\n<p>In particular, he developed investigative tools that help identify and control pathogen growth in cooked, processed meats and he implemented technologies to minimize pathogen transfer within high-risk areas.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, Dr. Butts led the team that developed Land O\u2019Frost\u2019s \u201cSeek &amp; Destroy\u201d process to identify and control Listeria monocytogenes growth niches, which has since been adopted across the meat industry and by other food sectors.</p>\n<p>He also introduced a pasteurization step and one-way product process that separated the raw and ready-to-eat (RTE) areas of plants.</p>\n<p>Butts is one of the founding members of an education program with the North American Meat Institute to teach environmental pathogen control. The program of strategies and practices to control Listeria in RTE meat and poultry products has been widely accepted across the U.S. and globally.</p>\n<p>\u201cJohn is a mentor, a cheerleader and a tireless advocate for food safety. In addition to being a lifelong learner, John is a lifelong sharer; he has worked tirelessly to push the limits of what needs to be done to make product safer through relentless sanitary design improvements. Most importantly, he shares what he has learned freely and openly with the rest of the industry,\u201d US Foods vice president for food safety Sharon Beals said in a news release.</p>\n<p><b>Purnendu C. Vasavada<br />\n</b>Retired now, Purnendu C. Vasavada\u2019s career included lasting contributions to advancing the safety of dairy products through teaching, applied research and training programs on novel food processing, emerging pathogens, microbial food safety and rapid methods for detecting microorganisms.</p>\n<p>For 30 years, he organized the Food Microbiology Symposium and Rapid Methods Workshop, which attracted scientists worldwide, provided a forum for expanding food safety knowledge, and helped companies understand emerging pathogens and developments in cultural, immunological and molecular methods to implement effective strategies for food safety and quality assurance.</p>\n<p>As an FDA-Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education Fellow, Vasavada was instrumental in forming the Food Safety Preventive Controls Alliance (FSPCA). In 2013, he helped initiate FSPCA working groups to develop training materials for the FSMA Preventive Controls for Human Foods regulation.</p>\n<p>The Food Safety Preventive Controls for Human Food course is now being offered to train FDA investigators, state food processing inspectors and the food processing industry in preparation for the upcoming implementation of rules from the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).</p>\n<p>During his career Vasavada initiated and managed collaborations with academia, industry and governmental agencies in the U.S. and abroad. Through the USDA Cochrane Fellowship program and the U.S. Agency for International Development, he developed training programs for visiting scientists and industry professionals from Asia and Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>He has taught more than 2,500 students and food science professionals, presented more than 150 papers and authored more than 100 publications, including co-editing the book \u201cBeverage Quality and Safety.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Vasavada\u2019s career epitomizes the mission of advancing food safety and represents an outstanding example of cooperation between scientists in academia, government and industry,\u201d said Damanna Ramkishan Rao, national program leader at the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, in a news release.</p>\n<p><b>Judy A. Harrison<br />\n</b>Judy A. Harrison designs and implements targeted food safety education programs for children, consumers, farmers and farmers\u2019 market managers to reduce the risk of foodborne illness and improve behaviors. She has collaborated with partners such as the Georgia Department of Agriculture, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Partnership for Food Safety Education (PFSE) to create and implement programs to help keep food safe nationwide.</p>\n<p>She has developed curricula, educational videos and print materials for extension agents, trained extension agents and disseminated food safety knowledge in consumer publications and the media. She uses focus groups and applied research to target the programs and then measures their effectiveness in improving food safety knowledge and behavior.</p>\n<p>Working with the PFSE and USDA, Harrison led the development of the series \u201cSmart Kids Fight BAC!\u201d \u2014\u00a0 an animated video, activity books and teaching guides \u2014 and the book \u201cHe\u2019s BAC!\u201d to teach kids to keep food safe.</p>\n<p>The curriculum significantly increased food safety knowledge of thousands of children and was requested in 27 states. \u201cWash Your Paws, Georgia!\u201d is another of Harrison\u2019s programs. It has taught more than 10,000 children proper hand washing to prevent illness.</p>\n<p>Her curriculum \u201cEnhancing the Safety of Locally Grown Produce\u201d has trained approximately 650 farmers and 150 market managers in five states. The program enhances consumer protection by increasing knowledge and safety practices such as self-inspections, improved cleaning and sanitizing, and better record keeping.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Harrison\u2019s work is nationally recognized and fills a need of providing scientifically-sound food safety information to multiple audiences in very creative ways so that it is well received and utilized. Her passion for food safety is visible in her expertise, leadership and outstanding work developing food safety education programs,\u201d said Hilary S. Thesmar, Vice President of Food Safety for the Food Marketing Institute, in a news release.</p>\n<p><b>Award jurors for 2016<br />\n</b>The NSF Food Safety Leadership Award nominations are judged by an independent panel of jurors.

CRF Frozen Foods of Pasco, WA, voluntarily recalled frozen fruit and vegetable items due to an illness outbreak of listeriosis. There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of Ajinomoto Windsor Inc.\u2019s products.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm498841.htm\">CRF Frozen Foods\u2019 recall</a> is posted on the Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s website.</p>\n<p>Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.</p>\n<p>Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.</p>\n<p>FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers&#8217; freezers.</p>\n<p>Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them.

Prior to that it was responsible for about 80 percent of the fresh produce testing done with federal funds.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_126226\" style=\"width: 416px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2016/05/workers-staking-field-tomatoes.jpg\"><img class=\"hello\" style=\"display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;\"class=\"size-full wp-image-126226\" src=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2016/05/workers-staking-field-tomatoes.jpg\" alt=\"Workers place stakes next to tomato seedlings to support the plants as they mature.\" width=\"406\" height=\"249\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workers place stakes next to tomato seedlings to support the plants as they mature.</p></div>\n<p>But University of Florida Professor Keith R. Schneider told a packed seminar audience that testing so late in the process has \u201cpractically zero predictive value.\u201d Schneider, a produce expert especially known for his work with\u00a0Florida tomatoes, said there may be a place for testing for verification.</p>\n<p>Schneider instead favors the preventive measures that growers are now working to implement under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). He sees the new law as part of an evolution beginning in 1998 when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first published a book of standards for produce.</p>\n<p>The publication soon became known as \u201cThe Green Book\u201d with the produce industry and led to the development of Good Agricultural Policies or GAPs. Schneider, who appeared with Gillian Kelleher, vice president for food safety and quality assurance for Wegmans Foods Markets, said those voluntary measures cut the number of outbreaks involving lettuce, tomatoes and some other produce.</p>\n<p>Then came the deadly 2006 outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 traced back to bagged spinach, which had enormous impact on consumers because most though the product was entirely safe and certainly free of a pathogen found in the intestinal tracks of cattle. More the 200 people from around the nation were sickened and 31 developed the life-threading Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). The outbreak resulted in three deaths,.</p>\n<p>Schneider said the spinach outbreak\u2019s devastating impact on the fresh produce industry was met with almost universal reaction from wholesale buyers such as the big retail and restaurant chains.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe cannot ever let this happen again,\u201d he said</p>\n<p>Schneider said the buyers demanded growers in California and Arizona enter into the \u201cLeafy Green Marketing Agreement (LGMA). Like \u201cThe Green Book\u201d and GAPs, the LGMA\u00a0was also a voluntarily food safety move. Schneider said it took time and money to win the consumers back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can just say: \u201cOur product isn\u2019t going to kill anybody anymore,\u201d he quipped.</p>\n<p>In Florida, where tomatoes were too often found contaminated with Salmonella, growers also responded by writing Tomato-GAPs and Tomato-BMPs (Best Management Practices). He said the tomato growers were reeling at the time, but his data shows improvement as time went on.</p>\n<p>Schneider and Kelleher agree the volunteer standards have for the most part prepared fresh produce growers for the FSMA. \u201cAt least they are going in the right direction, \u201cSchneider told the Summit attendees.</p>\n<p>While the FSMA\u00a0was signed into law in 2011, a five-year period of rule writing was required before most of its elements could go into effect. There were questions from the audience about what growers might expect when officials from the states and FDA begin showing up for the first \u201cpreventive\u201d inspections.</p>\n<p>Schneider said the deliberate pace of the rule writing was \u201cprobably a good thing.\u201d He said there were 15,000 comments on\u00a0the Produce Rule with one that took 172 pages to make its point.</p>\n<p>In response to a question, the University of Florida professor did say there are areas where FDA may find there is \u201cno science\u201d available upon which to make a \u201cscience-based\u201d decision. The question involved whether parts of mechanical harvesting equipment could be deemed to be \u201cfood contact surfaces.\u201d</p>\n<p>Schneider said its unlikely anyone has studied that subject, but it&#8217;s a good bet someone probably will soon.</p>\n<p>While small growers are exempted and large growers are prepared, each of the speakers did express concern about mid-sized growers. Some medium-sized growers, due to low prices, have allowed their fields to go fallow and others will plow them under if prices do not improve.</p>\n<p>The now defunct MDP, which a <em>New York Times</em> editorial writer called \u201ca tiny program that matters,&#8221; ended when Congress at the Obama Administration\u2019s request eliminated it&#8217;s funding. A small USDA office sent the money for testing on to mostly Land Grant universities, which sampled and tested fresh produce from their areas.</p>\n<p>FDA does still sample and test some fresh produce, mostly at the border.</p>\n<p>The 18th annual Food Safety Summit Conference &amp; Expo, which is being held for the first time at the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center in Rosemont, IL, wraps up today.</p>\n<p><b><i>(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click</i></b><b><i> </i></b><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VtY2Ysdln_R\"><b><i>here</i></b></a><b><i>.)</i></b></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/R0zrcTQceks\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/126217/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/126217/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Organic tea recalled nationwide because of Salmonella</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~3/T4OJ_H0tsuI/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/organic-tea-nationwide-recall-of-organic-tea-because-of-salmonella/#comments</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 21:26:42 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[News Desk]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food Recalls]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FDA]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[food recalls]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Frontier Co-op]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[organic]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[organic tea]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Salmonella]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.foodsafetynews.com/?p=126209</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Frontier Co-op of Norway, IA, is voluntarily recalling its Organic Hojicha Tea because of potential contamination with Salmonella bacteria.

Ohio&#8217;s\u00a0routine product sampling program isolated Listeria monocytogenes from True Goodness by Meijer brand frozen organic white sweet cut corn and frozen organic petite green peas.</p>\n<p>Both products were produced by CRF Frozen Foods. Whole genome sequencing showed that the Listeria monocytogenes isolate from the frozen corn was closely related genetically to seven bacterial isolates from ill people, and the Listeria monocytogenes isolate from the frozen peas was closely related genetically to one isolate from an ill person. This close genetic relationship provides additional evidence that the people in this outbreak became ill from eating frozen vegetables produced by CRF Frozen Foods.</p>\n<p>CRF\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm497297.htm\">first recall came on April 23nd</a> for 11 frozen vegetable products.

Oregon Potato Company responded by voluntarily recalling wholesale onion products, prompting downstream customer recalls.

The agency adds that toddlers consuming even one small apricot kernel risk being over the safe level.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden\">\n<div class=\"field__items\">\n<div class=\"field__item even\">\n<p>Apricot kernels contain a compound called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin\">amygdalin</a>\u00a0that converts to cyanide after consumption. Cyanide poisoning can cause nausea, fever, headaches, insomnia, thirst, lethargy, nervousness, joint and muscle aches and pains, and falling blood pressure. In extreme cases, it can be deadly.</p>\n<p>Studies indicate that 0.5 to 3.5 milligrams (mg) of cyanide per kilogram of body weight can be lethal. EFSA\u2019s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain set a safe level for a one-time exposure (known as the Acute Reference Dose, or ARfD) of 20 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. This is 25 times below the lowest reported lethal dose, the agency notes.</p>\n<p>Based on these limits and the amounts of amygdalin typically present in raw apricot kernels, EFSA\u2019s experts estimate that adults could consume three small apricot kernels (370 mg) without exceeding the ARfD. For toddlers, the amount would be 60 mg, which is about half of one small kernel.\u00a0EFSA adds that normal consumption of apricots does not pose a health risk to consumers.</p>\n<p>The kernel is the seed from inside the apricot stone. The kernel is obtained by cracking open and removing the hard stone shell and, therefore, it has no contact with the fruit.</p>\n<p>Most raw apricot kernels sold in the European Union are believed to be imported from outside the EU and marketed to consumers via the Internet. Some sellers promote them as a cancer-fighting food and recommend\u00a0intakes of 10 and 60 kernels per day for the general population and cancer patients, respectively.</p>\n<p>EFSA reports that the agency did not evaluate the claimed benefits of raw apricot kernels for cancer treatment or any other use since it was outside EFSA\u2019s food safety scope of inquiry and\u00a0not part of this scientific opinion.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/4424ax1.pdf\">risk assessment</a> will inform risk managers in the European Commission and Member States who regulate EU food safety, EFSA says. They will decide if measures are needed to protect public health from consumption of raw apricot kernels.</p>\n<p><b><i>(To\u00a0</i></b><b style=\"line-height: 1.5\"><i>sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click </i></b><a style=\"line-height: 1.5\" href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VcL0VsZNPVs\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>here</i></b></span></a><b style=\"line-height: 1.5\"><i>.)</i></b></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/D5ATQbZhb3w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/efsa-warns-of-cyanide-risk-from-eating-raw-apricot-kernals/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/efsa-warns-of-cyanide-risk-from-eating-raw-apricot-kernals/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Product that made people sick in U.S. recalled in Canada by Costco</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~3/Vy6q03nEYQg/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/126184/#comments</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 05:33:38 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[News Desk]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food Recalls]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[CFIA]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Costco]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.foodsafetynews.com/?p=126184</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Costco Wholesale Canada Ltd. is recalling Ajinomoto brand Yakitori Chicken with Japanese-Style Fried Rice from the marketplace due to possible Listeria monocytogenes contamination. \u00a0The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says consumers should not consume the recalled product.

According to the <a href=\"http://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/Shellfish/BiotoxinsIllnessPrevention/Biotoxins\">Washington State Department of Health</a>\u00a0(DOH), the problem comes when the shellfish eat toxin-producing algae and people eat the shellfish.</p>\n<p>DOH&#8217;s website notes that while the biotoxins don&#8217;t harm the shellfish, they can accumulate to\u00a0levels that can cause illness or death in\u00a0humans and other mammals\u00a0who consume them.</p>\n<p>An April 26 report by KCAW radio in Sitka\u00a0said\u00a0the tribe plans to open the lab sometime this\u00a0month if the test samples being sent to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Seattle check out.</p>\n<p>The lab has a plate reader, a\u00a0machine that can analyze for shellfish toxins. Five ounces of shellfish tissue are needed for each test, and lab manager Michael Jamros runs Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assays measuring the toxicity of shellfish samples. The data are then analyzed and the toxin level determined.</p>\n<p>The tribe&#8217;s environmental program manager, Chris Whitehead, came up with the plan for the new lab. He said he realized soon after arriving in Sitka\u00a0in 2013 that the state didn&#8217;t have the kind of warning system DOH provides for those who harvest shellfish in Washington state.</p>\n<p>\u201cNative people have been harvesting clams for thousands of years. A\u00a0lot of the elders I talk to don\u2019t do it anymore because they just don\u2019t know. So, to be able to bring that back and be able to utilize that resource is huge,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_49273\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2012/10/razor_clams-thumb.jpg\"><img class=\"hello\" style=\"display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;\"class=\"wp-image-49273 size-full\" src=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2012/10/razor_clams-thumb.jpg\" alt=\"razor_clams-thumb\" width=\"300\" height=\"207\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Harvesting razor clams.</p></div>\n<p>Whitehead also realized that sending locally harvested shellfish samples off to Anchorage for testing and waiting for results wasn&#8217;t an ideal situation from a public health standpoint. So he gathered together a coalition of tribes and formed the <a href=\"http://www.seator.org/seatt\">Southeast Alaska Tribal Toxins\u00a0network</a>\u00a0to monitor local beaches for toxic algae blooms and then secured $1 million in grants for the next three years.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo those sites will be monitored at the expense of the tribe and the resources that the tribes have every other week. So every tide cycle pretty much,\u201d Whitehead told KCAW.\u00a0The monitors will be checking plankton, identifying harmful species, and recording and sharing the information.</p>\n<p>The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation must prioritize <a href=\"http://dec.alaska.gov/EH/fss/seafood/Shellfish_Home.html\">testing shellfish</a> samples it receives from commercial harvesters over those from subsistence ones, said Patryce McKinney, chief of the department&#8217;s environmental health lab in Anchorage.</p>\n<p>She said\u00a0the lab&#8217;s regulatory fee for doing paralytic shellfish toxin testing for\u00a0recreational harvesters is $125 per sample, while commercial shellfish sample testing is covered by\u00a0cruise ship excise fees.</p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.iser.uaa.alaska.edu/Publications/2015_12-FiscalEffectsOfCommercialFishingMiningTourism.pdf\">recent economic analysis</a> from the University of Alaska-Anchorage, the cost for doing shellfish and other testing for the commercial fishing industry in fiscal year 2014 totaled $649,900.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_43069\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2012/10/musselsDSP-406.jpg\"><img class=\"hello\" style=\"display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;\"class=\"wp-image-43069 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2012/10/musselsDSP-406-300x184.jpg\" alt=\"musselsDSP-406\" width=\"300\" height=\"184\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mussels</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;They (the commercial shellfish industry) don&#8217;t have a choice where they go (for testing).\u00a0Most products are tested before they go into commerce, and some are even tested before harvest,&#8221; McKinney explained, noting that the lab typically sends out same-day preliminary results.</p>\n<p>She said the state-subsidized three-year\u00a0<a href=\"http://dec.alaska.gov/EH/fss/seafood/Docs/2013_Alaska_BivalveShellfish-Marine_%20Biotoxin_Monitoring_Plan.pdf\">pilot program</a> for biotoxin monitoring\u00a0of subsistence-harvested shellfish ended last year\u00a0and resulted in a few remote Alaskan\u00a0communities opting to continue the plan on their own.</p>\n<p>Of the pilot program shellfish samples her lab tested, &#8220;They failed more often than not,&#8221; McKinney noted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s because of the kind of harvest but more the location of the harvests. There are known areas that get high results, and all of these are beaches,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Going forward, the tribe&#8217;s plan is for those who harvest shellfish for personal use in southeast Alaska to send samples to the Sitka lab and get test results back within one business day. If any test results reveal unsafe toxin levels, the tribe will send out a community-wide alert, according to the lab&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.seator.org/Lab\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>The Sitka lab also plans to do testing for commercial shellfish harvesters at some point in the future, which would require FDA certification.\u00a0More information on the lab&#8217;s testing protocols can be found <a href=\"http://www.seator.org/Lab\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><b><i>(To\u00a0</i></b><b style=\"line-height: 1.5\"><i>sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click </i></b><a style=\"line-height: 1.5\" href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VcL0VsZNPVs\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>here</i></b></span></a><b style=\"line-height: 1.5\"><i>.)</i></b></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/JpvFkHA7uD4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/125732/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/125732/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>ConAgra inches closer to sentencing for Peter Pan outbreak</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~3/rcghFI3dUA8/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/conagra/#comments</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 05:01:04 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Dan Flynn]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food Policy & Law]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Foodborne Illness Outbreaks]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lawsuits & Litigation]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ConAgra Grocery Products Company]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Great Value peanut butter]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Judge W.

Louis Sands, requiring the government to conduct an expanded search for victims of a 2006-07 Salmonella Tennessee outbreak traced back to ConAgra\u2019s peanut butter processing plant in Sylvester, GA.</p>\n<p>Sands ordered nationwide newspaper advertisements and other measures so the government could complete &#8220;Victim Impact Statements&#8221; for inclusion in the pre-sentence report. ConAgra made both Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butters at the Sylvester facility.</p>\n<p>The two peanut butter brands were blamed for making at least 425 people across 44 states sick with the outbreak strain of Salmonella T., according to the final report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that the compilation of victim information has been concluded, both the government and defendant desire too move forward to a final resolution including either a single hearing date for both the entry of a guilty plea and sentencing, or alternatively a hearing date for the entry of a guilty please and a sentencing date,\u201d said assistant U.S. attorney Graham A. Thorpe.</p>\n<p>In response to a request from both Thorpe and ConAgra, Judge Sands on April 26 ordered the U.S. Probation Office to disclose the Victim Impact Statements to defense attorneys.

Three in Canada died and one in the U.S. died. All had such severe symptoms that they required hospitalization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2016/05/Rosa-DeLauro-close-Dole-quote.jpg\"><img class=\"hello\" style=\"display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;\"class=\"size-full wp-image-126174 alignright\" src=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2016/05/Rosa-DeLauro-close-Dole-quote.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa-DeLauro-close-Dole-quote\" width=\"406\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p>Dole closed the plant from late January until April 21, but company officials will not say what was done to clean the facility or what they are doing to keep it clean as they move forward.</p>\n<p>The FDA\u2019s internal policies prohibit its staff from commenting on open investigations. However, Dole officials confirmed in late April that in addition to the FDA and Centers for Disease control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the outbreak.</p>\n<p>In A May 6 letter to the FDA, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-CT, said company officials who continued to allow the salad production facility to operate even though they had known since at least 2014 that there was Listeria present acted unconscionably.</p>\n<p>\u201cGiven that consumers have been severely sickened, and even killed, by salads produced at this facility, I urge you to immediately shut down the Dole Springfield plant. Their blatant disregard for the health and safety of American families shows that Dole executives put company profits first, at the expense of consumers, and this type of behavior should not be tolerated,\u201d wrote DeLauro.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fact that Dole officials were aware of a food borne illness contamination in their facility, yet continued to ship out the product, is absolutely unconscionable. People have died, and rightfully the Department of Justice has opened an investigation into Dole\u2019s Springfield plant.</p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, it is more than just foodborne pathogens that the FDA inspection reports point to. FDA reports dating back to March 2014 cite at least sixteen problems that could contribute to food safety issues in the facility.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is an outrage that people had to die in order for Dole to temporarily close this plant for four months during the January Listeria outbreak. \u2026 Dole must be held accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>An FDA spokesman said when agency officials receive such letters from members of Congress they respond to the individual member and do not post a public response, generally.</p>\n<p><b><i>(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click</i></b><b><i> </i></b><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VtY2Ysdln_R\"><b><i>here</i></b></a><b><i>.)</i></b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/bpQbIZ0Y6C0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/congresswoman-wants-fda-to-shut-down-dole-salad-plant/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/congresswoman-wants-fda-to-shut-down-dole-salad-plant/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Salmonella in Organic Pastures raw cream spurs another recall</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~3/1rlwRgupCeg/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/salmonella-in-organic-pastures-raw-cream-spurs-another-recall/#comments</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 03:18:05 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Coral Beach]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food Recalls]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nutrition & Public Health]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[California Department of Food and Agriculture]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[California Department of Public Health]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[food recalls]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mark McAfee]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Organic Pastures Dairy]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[raw milk]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Salmonella]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[unpasteurized milk]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.foodsafetynews.com/?p=126178</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Organic Pastures Dairy Co. of Fresno, CA, is again recalling its raw milk products because of contamination with pathogens.
