After deliberately infecting pregnant mice, they found that the pups were born with brain damage and slightly abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to directly prove that the virus causes birth defects, the study authors write &lt;a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature18296\"&gt;in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The virus appears to have crossed the placenta, restricting the pups\u2019 growth \u2014 and not just in their heads, either, but all over their bodies.
