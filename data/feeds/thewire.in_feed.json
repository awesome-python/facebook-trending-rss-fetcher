Credit: Reuters/Danish Siddiqui/Files</p></div>\n<p>Dear Members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB),</p>\n<p>Two days ago I was sitting with the vice principal of the all girls\u2019 school I attended as a child in Kolkata. She told me how she was aghast at the request of one of the prospective students\u2019 mother to not disclose her educational qualification in front of her husband, when they come for a formal interview for admission. She had a masters in psychology from Aligarh Muslim University. &#8220;He thinks I have only studied up to class 10. If he finds out, he will divorce me,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>While the aftershocks of the opposition to the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/2003/08/10/stories/2003081000221500.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Shah Bano case</a>\u00a0continue to haunt Muslim women in the form of the <a href=\"http://admis.hp.nic.in/himpol/Citizen/LawLib/c177.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Muslim Women\u2019s bill</a>, as an Indian Muslim woman and a student of Islamic feminism and Human Rights Law I am amazed that little has changed since 1985 as far as the involvement of an organisation of your repute in matters concerning rights of Muslim women in India is concerned. Fully aware of the fear of many, including me, of mistaking the demand of codification with that of a demand of unification, I believed that educated members of the board would stand for and with Shayara Bano and her gender and demand that \u2018Triple Talaq\u2019 needed to be banned, made unlawful!</p>\n<p>Muslim women are expected to live and abide by religious norms and their conformity to religious values is viewed as a basis of judging the identity of their community as a whole, as discussed by Zoya Hassan<strong>\u00a0</strong>in her book<strong>,\u00a0</strong><em>Forging Identities: Gender, Communities and the State in India</em>. More often than not, they are discriminated against by patriarchal codes of religious laws and expected not to rise against the status quo in the name of protecting community identity. This community identity has emerged as a formidable force and what is evident today is a tension between two fronts: the male dominated Muslim leadership\u2019s desire to ensure that rights remain in the domain of a \u2018collective communal existence\u2019 and not a \u2018function of democratic citizenship\u2019 on one hand, and the demand for rights and justice for women on the other. Thus, in the wake of the rising political right and communal tensions and lynchings, the uncodified Muslim Personal Law in India \u2013\u00a0which deals with issues such as marriage, divorce, maintenance, inheritance, succession, adoption and custody of children\u00a0\u2013\u00a0has become a vital symbol of minority identity, the defense of which\u00a0\u2013\u00a0right from the overturning of the Shah Bano judgement\u00a0\u2013\u00a0has resulted in the subordination of Muslim women in India to the perceived interests of the Muslim community. The tussle between enactment of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) by the political right, governing heterogeneous communities as one, on one hand, and the insistence on maintenance of status quo, fearing the loss of their religious identity, by male leaders of the religious minorities on the other, has left Muslim women as the worst affected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thewire.in/2016/04/26/womens-rights-activists-rally-in-support-of-shayara-bano-31568/\" target=\"_blank\">Shayara Bano</a>, like her predecessor, Shah Bano has approached the apex court demanding the protection of a right which is not only constitutionally guaranteed to her, but for those opposing her, including the AIMPLB, it is imperative to know that her demand is not Unislamic at all. The board which claims to be the protector of Muslim Personal law (MPL) in India, and which is now going to be party to the case and contest her claim, should have done enough earlier to ensure that women like Shayara did not have to face what they are facing in the first place. Your claim that Muslims are content with the Shariah as it is practiced in India today has no basis, with no data to prove this claim. On the contrary, the <a href=\"https://bmmaindia.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan</a>\u2019s (BMMA) study, under the leadership of its founders Zakia Soman and Dr Noorjehan Safia Niaz, covering 4,500 women across ten Indian states is proof enough that <a href=\"http://thewire.in/2015/08/20/muslim-women-want-reforms-in-personal-laws-study-reveals-8886/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Muslim women</a> are demanding a codification of the largely uncodified body of Muslim laws in India. With over 80% respondents saying there needs to be a reform in the current MPL, over 75% also believed that the age of marriage for girls should not be on attainment of puberty but should be eighteen years and above, contrary to what you have been supporting. Over 80% of those surveyed were of the opinion that adoption should be made legal under MPL. Organisations like BMMA are also oblivious to the fact that their demand for reforms may be wrongly misappropriated by the political right, the ruling BJP, and thus is very vocal in clarifying that codification in no way is a demand for UCC. For instance, while the study shows that out of all the women surveyed, 92.1% were in favour of a total ban on the &#8216;Triple Talaq/oral divorce&#8217;, the solution suggested was in the form of &#8216;Talaq-e-Ahsan&#8217; to be the alternative, with majority of those surveyed wanting arbitration to be mandatory before divorce.</p>\n<p>If the divorce to Shayara Bano is declared illegal, will it be a defeat for the community? Or is the worry more about Muslim men not being able to unilaterally divorce their wives as and when they wish to?</p>\n<p>BMMA, in its draft <a href=\"https://bmmaindia.com/category/bmmas-draft-muslim-family-law/\" target=\"_blank\">Muslim Family Act</a> calls for a complete ban on &#8216;Triple Talaq&#8217; (Oral repudiation of marriage by merely pronouncement of the term \u2018Talaq\u2019 or divorce thrice by the husband) and calls for only the &#8216;Talaq-e-Ahsan&#8217; method of divorce. I have had the chance to compile case studies of women from across the country who have been divorced unilaterally by their husbands, sometimes even on the phone and thus am aware of ground realities of this evil myself. BMMA seeks a complete ban on &#8216;Triple\u00a0Talaq&#8217; and provide relief to specially women belonging to poor economic backgrounds.</p>\n<p>You at the AIMPLB on the other hand, refuse to take a firm stand on the issue. Thus, while you recommend the &#8216;Talaq-e-Ahsan&#8217; method described above, in your model &#8216;<em>Nikahnama&#8217;</em>, the husband is \u2018instructed\u2019 to merely \u2018avoid\u2019 using the &#8216;Triple Talaq&#8217; method of divorce. The board insists that the &#8216;Triple Talaq&#8217; method is not a legal evil but merely a social one and hence does not call for a complete ban.</p>\n<p>Maintenance of status quo in the name of not interfering in the \u2018divine\u2019, even though the S<em>hariah</em> as practiced in India is man-made law, has been the stand taken by the AIMPLB whenever confronted by issues which directly affect Indian Muslim women.

Credit: PTI</p></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/1707\" target=\"_blank\">recent verdict</a> by the arbitral tribunal constituted within the framework of the UN Convention on the Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS) is a singular travesty of justice and is\u00a0 \u00a0correctly seen as a victory for Italy. Italy has shown superior navigational skills through the deep waters of international arbitration. A reading of the text clearly shows that India had weakly defended its position. The natural question to ask is <a href=\"http://thewire.in/2016/05/04/the-international-tribunals-ruling-on-the-italian-marines-is-a-setback-for-india-and-justice-33708/\" target=\"_blank\">did India deliberately choose to put up a weak case</a>, or is it sheer incapability? If a choice was made, what prompted such a decision?</p>\n<p><strong>The incident and Italy\u2019s response </strong></p>\n<p>The first thing to understand about this case is that the Italian ship <em>Enrica Lexie</em> fled away after shooting and killing two Indian fishermen. If they had fired by mistake, they should have stopped and extended help to the fishing boat rather run away. The Indian Navy had to send a Dornier to \u2018persuade\u2019 <em>Enrica Lexie</em> to come back to Kochi. The Italian ship had claimed that it had carried out a successful anti-piracy action after it was fired upon by pirates. The INS <em>Kabra</em>, when sent to check whether the Italian ship was fired upon found no bullet marks on it. I personally remember officials in the Italian embassy telling me that afternoon that it was a Greek ship that killed the fishermen. Even now, if you talk to the embassy, it takes the line that the shots were fired by another ship. A few weeks later, Staffan de Mistura, the Italian special envoy dealing with the matter, told me at Thiruvananthapuram that according to him the ship was \u2018tricked into\u2019 coming back to Kochi and that it could have comfortably reached Port Said in a few hours. In short, from the onset, Italy started with a lie.</p>\n<p>Secondly, from the beginning Italy took an aggressive stand based on an erroneous interpretation of the law. Italy was not interested in seeking a diplomatic resolution. This became evident when a formula was informally suggested to Italy. The background is as follows: the then Italian ambassador had approached me for help. At that time the marines were in Kerala under the custody of the local police. The ambassador wanted to know whether he could go and see the Kerala chief minister, to which I let him know that it might be difficult. I then suggested to the ambassador the following formula:</p>\n<p><em>The state of Kerala will frame charges for homicide not amounting to murder; the two marines might get some years in prison; after they have spent some time in jail, they could be transferred to Italy to complete the sentence under the agreement signed a month before the shooting incident that provided for foreign nationals undergoing a prison sentence in another country to go back home to complete the sentence. </em></p>\n<p><strong>The failed formula</strong></p>\n<p>The ambassador liked the formula and asked me to find out whether Kerala would agree to it. I told him that I could sound out the chief minister via a telephonic conversation, but to take it further I would need to go and talk to him in person <em>after the Ambassador had given to me in writing that the Italian government accepted the formula and requested me to proceed further.</em></p>\n<p>I spoke to the chief minister from the Italian embassy and proposed the formula. His immediate reaction was positive, but he needed more time to decide. For good measure I told the chief minister that some Malayalis in Rome were feeling threatened to the extent that an Indian friend married to an Italian had stopped wearing a sari outside her house.</p>\n<p>But, the Italian ambassador checked with Rome about my formula and got a flat and stern rejection. If Rome had agreed the formula might have worked and the marines might have got back to Italy by 2014. When I had advanced the formula, the union government was inclined to go by the advice of the state.</p>\n<p><strong>The Indian response</strong></p>\n<p>Now coming to the Indian side, the matter could have been settled if the external affairs ministry (MEA) was left free to handle it. But the home ministry came in the way, we do not know why. Perhaps, there was an erroneous assumption that any speedy settlement might reflect adversely on Sonia Gandhi.</p>\n<p>As for the legal aspects, the MEA\u2019s legal and treaties division (L&amp;T) had made a strong case that the incident had nothing to do with UNCLOS and that it should be dealt with under the Indian Penal Code. But the basis on which Italy claimed jurisdiction was outlined Article 97 of UNCLOS, which says that \u201cin the event of an incident of navigation which gives rise to the penal responsibility of any person in the service of the ship, no penal proceedings may be instituted against such a person except before the judicial or administrative authorities either of the flag State or of the State of which such person is a national\u201d.</p>\n<p>Shooting unarmed, innocent fishermen and killing them is not an \u201cincident of navigation,\u201d it is a crime. Since UNCLOS does not apply, and the incident occurred within India\u2019s contiguous zone, the culprits tried to run away, and the victims were Indian nationals, it follows that India has jurisdiction over the matter.</p>\n<p>Although the L&amp;T had given its note immediately after the incident, it seems the system of government in India was unable to make use of it.</p>\n<p>Last year, I talked to a retired IPS officer who as part of the National Investigation Agency had dealt with this case. He told me that India had no jurisdiction. When I asked him about the note from L&amp;T he replied that he had never seen it. To my question why he did not ask for a note, there was no reply. This outlines the systemic lack of coordination in the government.</p>\n<p><strong>The Supreme Court\u2019s actions</strong></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court also contributed significantly to the confusion in two ways. Italy argued incorrectly that as Kerala had not signed the UNCLOS, it had no locus standi in the matter. The Supreme Court accepted that argument and stopped the proceedings in the Kerala high court. The fact of the matter is that since India had signed the UNCLOS, the Kerala was only acting on behalf of the union of India.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the court complicated the matter further by saying that although it was seized of the matter it was willing to consider Italy\u2019s plea that India had no jurisdiction in the matter. One may assume that in the Indian system, the L&amp;T note would not have reached the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p><strong>The victims</strong></p>\n<p>It is also important to discuss the compensation paid to the bereaved families of Jeslestine, 45, and Pinku, 22, the fishermen killed by the marines as the discourse in the media has ignored them and focused on the Italians.</p>\n<p>De Mistura had contacted me to ask for my help with this incident when deputed as the special envoy. I did not tell him of the formula that his government had rejected. My intention was to persuade him to pay some compensation to the families of the victims. Initially, he refused on the grounds that offering a compensation would imply Italy accepted the charge of its marines having shot the fishermen. I told him that the shooting was a fact. It was in that context that he told me that the ship should have sailed off to Port Said had it not been intercepted. Finally, he agreed to pay 30 lakh rupees as compensation, which India managed to have raised to one crore rupees.</p>\n<p>I had advised de Mistura not to involve his lawyers in the process of compensation and not to seek any written undertaking from the families. He had agreed. But his lawyers made the family sign a paper that said they forgave the marines in the name of Christ and were withdrawing their plaint, a move which later earned the displeasure of the court.</p>\n<p>What is the way out? Having virtually surrendered our claim for jurisdiction, there is no point in keeping the marines here. The arbitral tribunal is likely to rule formally that India has no jurisdiction. Let the marines go to Italy and let us learn a lesson from our follies at many levels.</p>\n<p><em>K.P.

Credit: Manvender Vashist/ PTI</p></div>\n<p>In a move that may stoke a political controversy, the Ministry of Human Resources and Development (MHRD) has directed its subsidiary organisation National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language (NCPUL) to introduce yoga classes in around 500 of its educational centres. The MHRD also asked the NCPUL to prepare its centres to celebrate International Yoga Day on 21 June, 2016. The order has become a source of friction between the MHRD and some NCPUL executive board members who oppose the directive on the grounds that yoga classes may cause unnecessary disorder in the NCPUL centres, most of which are located in <em>madrasa</em>s or minority institutions.</p>\n<p>The NCPUL issued a circular on 29 March, 2016, directing all its centres to comply with the MHRD order. Speaking to <em>The Wire, </em>the assistant director of academics at the NCPUL Shama K. Yazdani, who issued the circular to its centres, confirmed: \u201cWe issued a circular to our centres after the MHRD order. The order instructed us to publicise Yoga Day in our centres.&#8221; When asked whether the NCPUL has also been directed to hold compulsory yoga classes, Yazdani said there was no such compulsory requirement, but refused to divulge further information on the MHRD order.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://muslimmirror.com/eng/mhrd-to-ncpul-start-yoga-classes-at-your-centers/\" target=\"_blank\">report in <em>Muslim Mirror</em></a>, Yazdani is quoted as saying: \u201cIn fact, we have received a circular from MHRD to make special arrangement [sic] on International Yoga Day. The circular also directs [us] to start yoga classes at NCPUL centres across the country.\u201d</p>\n<p><b>Opinion divided within the NCPUL</b></p>\n<p>An NCPUL employee who wished to remain anonymous told <em>The Wire</em> that the MHRD order was issued to comply with an earlier directive of the Ministry of AYUSH to introduce yoga in all publicly-funded educational institutions of India. He said the MHRD order contained an advisory note listing the health benefits of yoga, by the union MHRD minister Smriti Irani. According to him, the order contains a list of instructions that explains how to perform various <em>yogasanas.</em> For example, it recommends <em>namaskar mudra </em>and various recitations like &#8220;<em>Om Shanti</em>.&#8221; It also recommends 45-minute classes everyday.</p>\n<p>An autonomous body under the MHRD, the NCPUL was established in 1996 to promote Urdu. But over time it expanded and introduced technical and vocational courses like computer applications, business accounting and graphic designing to increase its students&#8217; employability.</p>\n<p>The MHRD order is therefore odd, according to the NCPUL employee, because it requires the NCPUL to function outside its mandate.</p>\n<p>Many in the NCPUL feel similarly, that the MHRD order\u00a0is unprecedented. One staff member who wished to remain anonymous said, \u201cOne such order to observe Yoga Day came last year as well. But this year, the order contains a clear and detailed list of instructions. The very fact that the MHRD wants the NCUPL to introduce yoga classes in its centres makes it compulsory. How can one disobey the order?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many of NCPUL&#8217;s executive board members have also not responded well to the MHRD order. Tariq Anwar, board member and Nationalist Congress Party leader, said: \u201cI am not against yoga but I oppose the imposition of it in NCPUL centers. The MHRD should have first tried to interest the NCPUL students in yoga. Interested students could then come forward themselves and join yoga classes. They should have that choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Similarly, board member and Vice-Chairman of the NCPUL Muzaffer Hussain questioned NCPUL\u2019s Director Irteza Karim\u2019s intentions: \u201cYoga is a Hindustani tradition, but people should exercise their discretion to practice it. Such imposition of it makes the MHRD order look suspect. The NCPUL could have chosen to write a strong letter against such an imposition. But the present director is bent on projecting himself as\u00a0<em>Hindutva ka thekedar </em>(Hindutva\u2019s agent). He was recently appointed by the NDA government and has openly publicised positions in favour of the BJP. The NCPUL has become a dysfunctional body \u2013 almost a symbolic one. The present director has made no efforts to strengthen the institution from the time he has joined. We want him to do his job instead of pandering to the whims of the government.\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite several attempts, <em>The Wire</em> could not reach Karim, who is presently travelling outside India. Karim, who was appointed as the director in June 2015, was in the midst of a controversy earlier this year when the <a href=\"http://thewire.in/2016/03/20/ncpul-urdu-writers-declaration-form-25324/\" target=\"_blank\">NCPUL issued a declaration form</a> that required Urdu writers who wanted financial aid from the institution to affirm that their work would not criticise the government. This form was highly criticised by the literary community as attacking the right to free speech. Later, the NCPUL withdrew the controversial clause.</p>\n<p>Karim had then\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/urdu-writers-asked-to-declare-my-book-not-against-the-govt-nation/\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>The Indian Express</em></a>: \u201cIf a writer wants financial aid from the government, then of course the content cannot be against (the government). NCPUL is a government organisation and we are government employees.

Credit: Flickr</p></div>\n<p>Following the model of several developed countries, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has proposed that police officers wear body cameras and police vehicles be fitted with dashboard cameras, in order to enhance the monitoring of traffic offences and vehicular movement and make roads safer. It has also suggested that a Traffic Fund be created for financing such infrastructure projects.</p>\n<p>The MHA made these suggestions at a meeting of a group of ministers earlier created by the central government to guide reforms for the road transport sector. It has demanded that the dashboard and body cameras be installed promptly, subject to budget availability.</p>\n<p>It has further suggested that &#8220;Special Police Officers&#8221; take photographs and videos of traffic violations, and that private citizens be empowered to help eradicate violations, by being allowed to upload photographs and videos of violations on traffic police websites.</p>\n<p>If the MHA\u2019s proposals are approved, they will help eradicate not only traffic violations but also corrupt practices by police officers on the roads. Police personnel would have to think twice before taking bribes, since cameras linked through the Global Positioning System would be monitoring and recording all their movements.</p>\n<p>The MHA has stressed the use of technology because a <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/jumping-red-light-get-slapped-with-rs-15-000-fine-under-proposed-traffic-law/story-Ss7QYDXGHr7ZcrVk4PFVVP.html\">major hike has been proposed</a> in penalties for traffic offences, and it does not want the new high fines to become a tool in the hands of the police to extort money from traffic violators.</p>\n<p>In order to further decrease the likelihood of corruption, the MHA has also suggested that only traffic police personnel of the rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector or higher be allowed to check for violations and impose penalties. And to prevent offenders from unnecessarily contesting penalties, it has called for higher fines for frivolous challenges.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Committee is conscious of the fact that with enhancement of penalties there is a strong likelihood of increased corruption among enforcement agencies. It is hence proposed [sic] to empower only a certain category of officers to impose penalties and over a certain time frame have a mechanism in place to document all activities of the enforcement agencies to ensure transparency,\u201d the Ministry said.</p>\n<p>The United States is currently <a href=\"https://www.einvestigator.com/police-body-cameras-the-pros-and-cons-for-law-enforcement-and-citizens/\" target=\"_blank\">evaluating the use of body cameras</a>, in response to complaints of police personnel using excessive force.</p>\n<p><strong>Traffic Fund</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure the funds needed for the proposed infrastructure, the MHA has demanded that a section for the creation of a Traffic Fund be incorporated in the Motor Vehicles Act. It has pointed, as an example that justifies its suggestion, to the provision that exists in the Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances Act for the National Fund for Control of Drug Abuse.</p>\n<p>It has suggested that the Traffic Fund be created from governmental contribution, 50% of fines collected, sale proceeds of seized vehicles, and other income, such as that earned through corporate social responsibility, provided it is approved by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.</p>\n<p>The fund will allow for the purchase of body and dashboard cameras, closed circuit television camera systems, automatic number plate recognition cameras, traffic app-enabled smartphones and bluetooth penalty devices, as well as be used for the development of traffic-related apps, road signs and dividers, and for compensating enforcement personnel in case of injury or loss of life during duty.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thewire.in/2016/05/13/home-ministry-proposes-technology-driven-measures-for-road-safety-35654/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>African Scientists a Step Closer to Testing for TB in a Matter of Minutes</title>\n\t\t<link>http://thewire.in/2016/05/13/african-scientists-a-step-closer-to-testing-for-tb-in-a-matter-of-minutes-35447/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://thewire.in/2016/05/13/african-scientists-a-step-closer-to-testing-for-tb-in-a-matter-of-minutes-35447/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 03:00:44 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Gerhard Walzl]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[World]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[biomarkers]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[biosignatures]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[blood tests]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[clinical trials]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[healthcare workers]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[HIV/AIDS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[tuberculosis]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[World Health Organisation]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://thewire.in/?p=35447</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[According to the WHO, 1.5 million people died from TB in 2014.

According to the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organisation</a>, 1.5 million people died from TB in 2014. The c</em><em>hallenges in tackling the disease include the facts that people are tested too late and that the turnaround for most tests is long. To remedy this a point-of-care rapid diagnostic test for TB has been developed by a multinational team of scientists led by researchers at Stellenbosch University in South Africa.\u00a0One of its co-inventors, Professor <strong>Gerhard Walzl</strong>, spoke to The Conversation Africa\u2019s health and medicine editor Candice Bailey.</em></p>\n<p><strong> How have TB tests been done up until now and what are the challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>There are three main tests that are currently in use.</p>\n<p>A culture test \u2013 the most sensitive \u2013 requires people to produce a sputum sample that is sent to a centralised laboratory where a culture test is done. A positive result shows up after ten days. A confirmed negative result takes up to 42 days.</p>\n<p>The problem with this test is that it is only available in centralised laboratories, which means patients must make several trips to a hospital or health facility to get their results. And it is very expensive.</p>\n<p>Then there is the sputum microscopy test. This is widely used in Africa. It requires the sputum slides of each patient to be individually checked.</p>\n<p>The test is inexpensive. But it is labour intensive, which means that only a limited number of smear tests can be assessed a day. In addition, it only has a 60% sensitivity rate.</p>\n<p>On top of this, the test poses particular challenges for children and for people living with HIV.</p>\n<p>In the case of young children, samples need to be taken from their stomachs as they cannot follow instructions to produce a good quality sputum sample. This requires the use of a nasal tube, which is not pleasant for the child or the health-care worker.</p>\n<p>The test also isn\u2019t effective for people living with HIV. This is because their sputum often has low levels of the bacteria, which can lead to a false negative test result.</p>\n<p>There is also a molecular test that detects bacterial DNA in the sputum sample. This test only takes two hours to produce a result and although it speeds up the detection of TB, it is not widely available to people in rural areas as instruments are placed in a centralised manner.</p>\n<p><strong> How will your test change this? </strong></p>\n<p>If <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27146200\" target=\"_blank\">our test</a> is accepted after clinical trials are completed it will be able to provide almost immediate results. People will be able to be diagnosed and start treatment in a single visit to a health-care facility.</p>\n<p>The test is done with blood obtained from a finger prick and can make a TB diagnosis in less than an hour. The diagnostic test is a hand-held, battery-operated instrument that will measure chemicals in the blood of people with possible TB. This test will not have to be done in a laboratory and health-care workers will be able to perform it with minimal training.</p>\n<p>It is a low-cost screening test and has the potential to significantly speed up TB diagnosis in resource-limited settings.</p>\n<p><strong> At what stage is the test? </strong></p>\n<p>The test is still in development. We have patented the biosignature, which identifies the levels of chemicals in the blood of a patient. A biosignature consists of a combination of chemicals and indicates a disease state. This signature was discovered by African scientists. The inventors included South African, Cameroonian and Ethiopian scientists.</p>\n<p>The test\u2019s accuracy and efficacy will be tested in five African countries over the next three years. We will recruit 800 people who have TB symptoms from Namibia, the Gambia, Uganda, Ethiopia and South Africa.</p>\n<p>Clinical research sites will be set up or strengthened in all five countries. And participating countries will be able to use the data generated from this project.</p>\n<p>We are still trying to improve the signature by adding additional markers. In addition, we would like to optimise and fine tune the device to enable it to measure the signature on a strip similar to a pregnancy test or a glucose test strip.</p>\n<p><strong> Why is the test important for South Africa? </strong></p>\n<p>South Africa has the highest TB rates in the world. Each year between 450,000 and 500,000 people develop TB. This gives the country an incidence rate of <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr15_annex04.pdf?ua=1\" target=\"_blank\">834 infections</a> for every 100,000 people. On the rest of the continent, the incidence rate is between <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/\" target=\"_blank\">300 and 600 infections</a> for every 100,000 people. In <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.TBS.INCD\" target=\"_blank\">China</a> the incidence is 68 for every 100,000 people and in most European countries it is less than ten for every 100,000 people.</p>\n<p>One of the challenges in South Africa is that people in remote areas with high TB incidence still do not benefit from newer developments in TB testing. As a result they face long diagnostic delays and often need to come back to clinics on several occasions before they are diagnosed.</p>\n<p>This test will mean that health-care workers with minimal training can use the test at grassroots level and get immediate access to screening test results.</p>\n<p>It would also reduce the cost of testing for TB. Our test would initially cost US$2.50 per test. With commercialisation that price could drop significantly. Currently the culture test costs $45 per test while the DNA sample test costs $12 per test.</p>\n<p><strong> How does this test fit into the bigger picture of dealing with TB? </strong></p>\n<p>The test would be used best as a screening test. This is because it can identify people who need further investigation and can screen out those who don\u2019t. So far we have been able to identify 70% of patients who do not need further testing.</p>\n<p>The World Health Organisation <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/publications/Final_TB_Screening_guidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">has identified</a> a screening test as important for high-prevalence areas, for those who are in contact with people who have TB, those living with HIV, homeless people, immune-compromised people and those living in areas with poor access to diagnostic services.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/59285/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><em>Gerhard Walzl\u00a0is Head of the Immunology Research Group at the Division of Molecular Biology &amp; Human Genetics, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University.</em></p>\n<p><em>This article was <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/african-scientists-a-step-closer-to-testing-for-tb-in-a-matter-of-minutes-59285\" target=\"_blank\">originally published</a> on </em>The Conversation<em>.</em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thewire.in/2016/05/13/african-scientists-a-step-closer-to-testing-for-tb-in-a-matter-of-minutes-35447/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Watch: Pinjra Tod and Differential Hostel Policies in India</title>\n\t\t<link>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/watch-pinjra-tod-and-differential-hostel-policies-in-india-35641/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/watch-pinjra-tod-and-differential-hostel-policies-in-india-35641/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:11:51 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Wire Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Gender]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[DCW]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Delhi Commission for Women]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[female hostellers]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[hostels]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Pinjra Tod]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://thewire.in/?p=35641</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Members of the Pinjra Tod campaign Shambhawi Vikram and Avantika Tiwari talk to The Wire about the problems faced in hostels, the movement, challenges and where it's going. ]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Members of the Pinjra Tod campaign Shambhawi Vikram and Avantika Tiwari talk to <em>The Wire</em>\u00a0about the problems faced\u00a0in hostels, the movement, challenges and where it&#8217;s going.\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"fb-video\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thewire.in/videos/1010769488997381/\" data-width=\"850\" data-show-text=\"false\">\n<div class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\">\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/thewire.in/videos/1010769488997381/\"><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thewire.in/videos/1010769488997381/\">In conversation with Pinjra Tod</a>Live chat with Pinjra Tod: Break the Hostel Locks</p>\n<p>Posted by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thewire.in/\">TheWire.in</a> on Thursday, 12 May 2016</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Pinjra Tod (literally meaning \u2018break the cage\u2019) is a campaign that started in August last year around colleges and universities in Delhi, opposing discriminatory policies for women hostellers. Female students typically face rigid curfew times, higher rents, stringent regulations (often leading to moral policing) and almost completely different experiences of living in universities from their male counterparts, all wrapped in the explanation of \u201csafety\u201d. Even in access to university facilities, such as libraries and laboratories, the gender bias shows up \u2013 female students are often mandated to be in their room much before these facilities close.</p>\n<p>The campaign has continued to grow with time. They have collected experiences of women students not just in Delhi but from all over the country, all facing similar oppressive conditions. In a report compiled for the Delhi Commission for Women, some of the <a href=\"http://thewire.in/2016/04/27/safety-or-moral-policing-the-unapologetic-gender-bias-of-indian-hostels-31964/\">experiences of hostellers in Delhi</a> have been released, along with recommendations on how these issues can be tackled. In response to the report, DCW has issued notices to all registered universities in Delhi, asking them to provide data on their policies and hostel conditions and explain the differential regulations.</p>\n<p>In conversation with <em>The Wire</em>, Tiwari and Vikram, both part of the Pinjra Tod campaign since its inception, talk about how the movement came into being, the issues women in hostels face, the challenges and hesitance they saw (including from other female students) and where they plan to go from here.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/watch-pinjra-tod-and-differential-hostel-policies-in-india-35641/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Freedom Under Fire: SC Pulls Up Centre, States on Drought Again; Gujarat Textbook Has Nehru Explaining &#8216;Bharat Mata&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/freedom-under-fire-sc-pulls-up-centre-states-on-drought-again-gujarat-textbook-has-nehru-explaining-bharat-mata-35608/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/freedom-under-fire-sc-pulls-up-centre-states-on-drought-again-gujarat-textbook-has-nehru-explaining-bharat-mata-35608/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:53:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jahnavi Sen]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Rights]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[AFSPA]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bharat Mata ki Jai]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[disability rights]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[drought]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FCRA]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Gujarat]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jawaharlal Nehru]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Supreme Court]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Teesta Setalvad]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[transgender property rights]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://thewire.in/?p=35608</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A round-up of news, both bad and good, on the rights front from India.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A round-up of news, both bad and good, on the rights front from India.</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_35624\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/52228952.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-35624 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/52228952.jpg?resize=400%2C300\" alt=\"File photo of a drought hit area.

The embattled head of state is facing a serious threat of impeachment. The start of the Olympic Torch Relay is usually a ceremonial event but the unusual political situation in the country could not be ignored. Rousseff was mindful of reminding her country\u2019s citizens and the world of the possible ramifications for the Rio de Janeiro Games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I am certain that a country whose people know how to fight for their rights and to protect their democracy is a country where the Olympics will have great success in the coming months,\u201d she was reported as saying by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reuters</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The message was clear; political instability could boil over to the organisation of an event that was supposed to establish Brazil as an emerging world power.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Rio was awarded the hosting rights for the Games in 2009, the country saw it as a sign of great things to come. The then President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva was enjoying immense popularity as he oversaw the second term of his tenure. The optimism in his voice is a far cry from the mood brought by a corruption scandal that has implicated politicians on both sides of the divide. His words upon winning the bid reflected the positivity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cToday is the day that Brazil gained its international citizenship. Today is the day that we have overcome the last vestiges of prejudice against us. I think this is the day to celebrate because Brazil has left behind the level of second-class countries and entered the ranks of first-class countries. Today we earned respect. The world has finally recognized that this is Brazil\u2019s time.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But which Brazil\u2019s time is it now? As the country battles a political crisis, who is it that stands to gain from the hosting of the Olympics? The Workers\u2019 Party (PT) which was in power when Rio won the bid but is likely to be ousted by the time the Games begin? Or is it the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) whose politicians Eduardo Paes and Luiz Fernando Pezao are Rio\u2019s Mayor and Governor, respectively?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hosting of the\u00a0games themselves is not under doubt. But the political wrangling has severely impacted the mood ahead of the Olympics. As Dave Zirin wrote for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earlier this week, there\u2019s muted hype around the Olympics in Rio with less than three months to go. When democracy itself is at stake in the country, people could be forgiven for taking their eyes off a sporting spectacle \u2013 even if it\u2019s the Olympics. In this case, sport cannot be the opium of the people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, there is political capital to be had from the successful organisation of the Olympics. The torch relay is particularly significant in this context. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) views excellence, friendship and respect as integral components of Olympism. The Olympic Games stand for a world that brings people together in peaceful harmony. The values of the Olympic movement, however, would seem to hold little water in the current scenario.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The essentialist conception of Olympism is misguided too. Professor Kevin Wamsley at the Western University (Canada) was much closer to the truth when he wrote that the Olympic ideology is a, \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">metaphorical empty flask to be filled by the next political, economic, educational opportunist.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opportunism inherent within the Olympic movement can be seen in the origins of the Olympic Torch. To draw a mythical connection with the Ancient Olympic Games, the Torch is lit in Olympia (Greece) before travelling to the host country. However, the flame did not make its first appearance until the 1936 Games in Berlin. The German dictator Adolf Hitler\u2019s belief in the Greek lineage of the pure Aryan race led him to present a connection to the land of the modern Olympics when he oversaw the hosting of the Games. The propaganda at the Games was geared to establish the legitimacy of Hitler\u2019s dictatorship and the Olympic Torch proved to be a convenient symbol.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nazi propagandist and filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl also appropriated the flame in her 1938 film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olympia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as she engaged in the promotion of Aryan sportspersons. Since, the torch has been a worthy object for advancing political interests. For example, Australia\u2019s attempt to right the historical marginalisation of the Aboriginal community found an expression in Cathy Freeman lighting the torch at the 2000 Sydney Games Opening Ceremony.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as the flame goes on a 94-day relay throughout Brazil, what is the message that it could possibly carry? In a country deeply divided politically, economically and socially, how do the Olympic values of friendship and respect survive? Although the Olympic movement emphasises peace and reconciliation, how does that become possible when a president stands on the brink of impeachment, the country is experiencing its worst economic downturn for decades and the rich engage in corrupt means to enlarge their wealth and influence?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olympic values cannot provide the answer. In fact, they are part of the problem. The media-corporate nexus that drives the Olympic movement has also chosen to attack the Workers\u2019 Party selectively for its part in the corruption scandal. As it has turned out, those trying to wrest power are not squeaky clean. Sample this: the current vice-president, Michel Temer, from the opposition PMDB is the elites\u2019 choice for replacing Rousseff. But he has been convicted of breaking campaign finance laws. This is not about corruption. This is, as some have said, an attempt at coup.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Also read:\u00a0<a href=\"http://thewire.in/2016/03/25/a-coup-is-in-the-air-the-plot-to-unsettle-rousseff-lula-and-brazil-25893/\" target=\"_blank\">The plot to unsettle Rousseff, Lula and Brazil</a></strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Olympics are implicated in this fight for power as Brazil wants to be seen as pro-business and market friendly to the global stakeholders. The media-corporate nexus sees this as in opportunity to push its agenda and the corruption scandal was there to be exploited. However there is a concerted effort to keep the Olympics \u2018out of it\u2019 while attempts are made to oust a legitimately elected government.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can be particularly seen in the case of Marcelo Odebrecht, who was sentenced for 19 years in jail two months ago. Odebrecht\u2019s eponymous construction company was responsible for the building of multiple 2014 World Cup and the Rio Games venues. But he was jailed for his involvement in the Petrobras scandal that has claimed other politicians too. To this day, his dealings in the Olympics construction business remain unscrutinised. The media itself has kept mum on the nature of the dealings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to claim that Odebrecht\u2019s business activities for the Olympic venues definitely involved criminal actions. But it seems rather remarkable, as Zirin noted</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that the construction magnate has escaped scrutiny over this. The special significance of the Olympics to Brazil has probably meant that any dealing involved with the Games is not worthy of investigation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as the elites seek to displace the elected government, they recognise an opportunity to celebrate the new dispensation when the Olympics begin. It will be an occasion to present a \u2018new Brazil\u2019. Whether the new Brazil will be true to the ethos of democracy is seemingly a minor concern. In the name of fighting corruption and promoting business interests, a whole set of other dangers are set to engulf Brazilians.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surely, the IOC would like to ensure that its marquee event is not beholden to games of political trickery? However,\u00a0it has maintained in public that these issues would not affect the Rio Games. In fact, it could be argued that the various corporate sponsors stand to gain from the elites seizing power in Brazil. The IOC has equated its objectives with those of its sponsors in the past. Therefore, it would benefit from the establishment of a government that prioritises business interests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reuters</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> report recently revealed that the government tourism department that is responsible for the overseas promotion of the Rio Games has seen three different heads in the last month or so. Of course, this has ensured that the buzz around the Games has been relatively underwhelming. Furthermore, the flame relay has been going on for over a week but the media reaction to it remains surprisingly low-key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is remarkably different from the media coverage of the protests that took place ahead of the FIFA Confederations Cup when people took to the streets in order to protest against corruption and poor delivery of public services. The IOC would of course prefer to garner more positive interest. But a more serious issue is up for debate now and the Olympics are being deliberately distanced from it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this scenario, it is useful to question why the media and corporate industry continue to underplay the impact of the current crisis on the Olympics. Rousseff remained steadfastly clear on the need for political stability and democracy if the Games were to go ahead smoothly. But those on the other side of the political divide, while themselves battling allegations of corruption, are on the path to remove an elected government by underhand means just a few months before the biggest sporting spectacle in the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One fears the meaning the Olympics will be given, if and when the coup comes to fruition. Till now, it has been seen as separate from the political sphere. It is meant to be a spectacle that brings Brazilians together in a celebration of their country\u2019s values. But the likelier outcome, considering the current scenario, looks to be heading in an altogether different direction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Olympics will probably be held successfully and the current opposition will use it to justify its actions. It will not be a celebration of the Olympic Games and its values. Rather, it is likely to a celebration of a \u2018new\u2019 Brazil. A new Brazil where democracy will be much weaker than before. A new Brazil where excellence, friendship and respect might be hard to come by.</span></p>\n<p><em>Priyansh\u00a0is a Chevening Scholar studying the sociology of sport at Loughborough University, United Kingdom.</em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/why-is-nobody-questioning-the-brazilian-crisiss-impact-on-the-olympics-35425/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Russia&#8217;s Communist Party Is Growing Again but Can It Be a Potential Vehicle of Social Change?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/russias-communist-party-is-growing-again-but-can-it-be-a-potential-vehicle-of-social-change-34998/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/russias-communist-party-is-growing-again-but-can-it-be-a-potential-vehicle-of-social-change-34998/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:32:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Fred Weir]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[World]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Boris Yeltsin]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Communist Party]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Freud]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Fromm]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Gennady Zyuganov]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Moscow's State University for the Humanities]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NATO]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Russia's CP]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Soviet Union]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[United Russia party]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vladimir Putin]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://thewire.in/?p=34998</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[In the past two election cycles, the CP increased its vote from about 12 to 20%, and could be set to make major gains this time around. ]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>In the past two election cycles, the CP increased its vote from about 12 to 20%, and could be set to make major gains this time around.</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_35611\" style=\"width: 625px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CP-Russia.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-35611 size-full\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CP-Russia.jpg?resize=615%2C431\" alt=\" Supporters of the Russian communist party attend a rally.

Credit: Reuters</p></div>\n<p><strong>Moscow:</strong>\u00a0With the collapse of the USSR, it was generally assumed that the failed state&#8217;s main architect, the Communist Party (CP), would gradually shuffle off to a well-deserved berth in history&#8217;s dustbin.</p>\n<p>That didn&#8217;t happen. At first, amid the savage economic transition of the 1990&#8217;s millions of older Russians, motivated largely by nostalgia for the Soviet welfare state, rallied to the old party. In 1999, the party&#8217;s huge parliamentary fraction came within sight of impeaching <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/16/world/drive-to-impeach-russian-president-dies-in-parliament.html\" target=\"_blank\">then-President Boris Yeltsin</a>.</p>\n<p>Predictions that the CP would fade away as all those militant pensioners died off have not panned out either. The hyper-popular President Vladimir Putin has stolen much of the communists&#8217; populist thunder by regularly raising pensions and civil service salaries and presided \u2013\u00a0until recently \u2013\u00a0over one of the most impressive economic expansions in Russian history. Putin also co-opted the rhetoric and powerful <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2016/0129/Maybe-the-Soviets-weren-t-so-bad-Russian-nostalgia-for-USSR-on-the-rise\" target=\"_blank\">symbolism of old superpower</a>, as seen in this week&#8217;s massive Victory Day parade, replete with marching troops, newly-minted Stalin medallions and flowing hammer-and-sickle banners.</p>\n<p>Despite all that, the old CP is actually growing and appears ready to mount a serious challenge to the ruling <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/politics/331706-united-russia-renews-leadership-sees/\" target=\"_blank\">United Russia party</a> in September&#8217;s parliamentary elections. In the past two election cycles, the CP increased its vote from about 12 to 20%, and could be set to make major gains this time around.\u00a0\u00a0The party has lately pulled off some surprise upsets in<a href=\"http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0427-communists-beat-ruling-united-russia-party-in-irkutsk-region-governors-election/\" target=\"_blank\"> recent regional polls </a>as well.</p>\n<p>In defiance of all expectations, large numbers of youthful and often well-educated new activists are moving into the old party, and starting to rejuvenate its complexion and its prospects. The CP has some 160,000 members, about 40% of whom are under 35, according to Yaroslav Listov, the party&#8217;s chief of youth policy.</p>\n<p>The leadership remains overwhelmingly gray \u2013\u00a0consider this gallery of the party&#8217;s nearly <a href=\"https://kprf.ru/dep/gosduma/deputies\" target=\"_blank\">100 current Duma deputies</a>, with it&#8217;s smattering of youthful faces \u2013\u00a0but the party&#8217;s demonstrations and other public events reveal a much more youthful vibe. And conversations with young activists suggest they are far less concerned with the great achievements of the Soviet epoch and the bread-and-butter issues that animate older members, and far more interested in the ideological core of the old Bolshevik party, which involves radical egalitarianism and uncompromising anti-capitalism.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Liberals declare that Putin has created a kind of Soviet-lite regime, and ask why we communists aren&#8217;t happy with it?&#8221; says Nikita Popov, a 26-year old political science graduate and internet news editor. &#8220;But there is less equality than ever in this country. There is a mutant type of capitalism, which enriches the friends of Putin, while the majority are gradually being impoverished and losing their rights. When Putin pretends to sympathise with communism, he&#8217;s just playing to simple people. In fact, he is domestically pursuing a liberal course, slashing social benefits and expanding the economic power of big business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Popov and his friends are derisive of <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2016/0414/A-kinder-gentler-Putin-President-speaks-softly-on-Russian-call-in-show-video\" target=\"_blank\">Putin&#8217;s &#8220;hands-on&#8221; management style</a>, in which the Kremlin leader holds big nationally-televised electronic town hall meetings, in which he addresses \u2013\u00a0and solves on the spot \u2013\u00a0the problems of average Russians who phone in to complain of unpaid wages, bad roads or rapacious bureaucrats.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is just PR smoke-and-mirrors,&#8221; says Popov. &#8220;Sooner or later, something&#8217;s going to break. I&#8217;m personally ready for revolution, just like in 1917.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The fact that Russia is mired in its second year of deep economic recession may help to focus minds. Polls show that Russians tend to be left-wing in their political instincts, perhaps due to the Soviet experience or the country&#8217;s longer history of collectivism, and the communists speak to that in times of trouble more effectively than other parties can, Popov insists.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy to ignore a party that&#8217;s over a century old, once led Russia to superpower status, and is coming back despite all the forces arrayed against it, says Grigory Azhogin, a party activist at Moscow&#8217;s State University for the Humanities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Here in Moscow you don&#8217;t see how bad things are. But I&#8217;m from a small mining city, where most mines and factories have been shut down,&#8221; he says. &#8220;People know the present authorities are corrupt, they&#8217;re not interested in listening to the people. For most Russians nowadays, this is the &#8216;period of survival&#8217;. It will be followed by political mobilisation, and who are people going to turn to if not the CP?&#8221;</p>\n<p>As in the old days, the CP is organised into local cells, which meet regularly, discuss party policy, and plan activities. For some young Russians, alienated by Western culture but also put off by the corruption and what they see as the shallow values of the Putin regime, the party cell provides a vital personal support network and a forum to explore alternative ideas.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I actually came to the party by reading Western literature, like Freud, Fromm and Marcuse. I want to study more, and I found this circle of people who are completely enthusiastic about the same things,&#8221; says Konstantin Kopelov, a law student. &#8220;These people are my comrades. We talk about everything, music, theatre, movies, radical politics, whatever is going on. We are spiritual kin, and we are searching together for the way forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Under its venerable leader, Gennady Zyuganov, the party has been careful to avoid confrontation with the Kremlin. That has led a lot of critics to dismiss it as &#8220;Putin&#8217;s pocket communist party,&#8221; and it has indeed seemed all-too-willing to accept the perks that go with being part of the establishment. When tens of thousands of middle class <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2011/1210/Russia-protests-Moscow-rocked-by-biggest-since-fall-of-USSR\" target=\"_blank\">Russians took to the streets</a> in 2011 to protest alleged mass fraud by the ruling United Russia party\u00a0, the party was slow to join in, even though it had its own catalogue of grievances over alleged dirty tricks and vote-stealing by the Kremlin party. And when the street protests wound down, the CP managed to avoid the fate of liberal and other leftist groups, who were <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2015/1231/How-one-Russian-became-an-object-lesson-for-all-would-be-protesters\" target=\"_blank\">hounded by mass arrests</a>, subjected to <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2012/1030/Prospect-of-show-trial-stirs-some-Russians-memories-of-Stalinism\" target=\"_blank\">political trials</a>, and in some cases\u00a0 driven into exile.</p>\n<p>That makes some long-time observers cynical about the CP&#8217;s potential as a vehicle for genuine social change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the Putin era the CP has become completely integrated into the system,&#8221; says Boris Kagarlitsky, a veteran left-wing intellectual. &#8220;It has been said that &#8216;the CP is not so much a political party anymore, as it is a licensed monopoly to provide opposition services to the public.&#8217; That sums it up pretty well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Listov, the party youth chief, insists that perception is wrong. For example, he says, the fact that the CP strongly supports the Kremlin&#8217;s current foreign policy is because Putin has come around to the CP&#8217;s point-of-view about the West, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When Putin came to power, he tried his best to be a partner with the US. We warned that wouldn&#8217;t work, that they would only exploit Russian weakness to expand NATO and isolate us,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Now Putin has learned through hard experience that the West can&#8217;t be trusted. He won&#8217;t give us any credit, of course, but it&#8217;s our policy not his.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unlike many European former communist parties, Russia&#8217;s CP has never fully embraced parliamentarism, where parties alternate in power according to the results of elections. Russia&#8217;s CP continues to believe that social revolution will be necessary to return the country to the path of socialism. And younger communists seem more emphatic about this than their elders.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are not thinking of revolution as a change of one leader by another,&#8221; says Kopelev, the law student. &#8220;For us it&#8217;s a social transformation through mass action, and participating in elections is just one aspect of that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Kremlin has been worried enough about the CP, with its solid and durable base of support, to try about a decade ago to replace it with an artificial but totally loyal left-wing party, <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0227/p06s01-woeu.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fair Russia</a>. But that did not enjoy much electoral success, leaving the <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/politics/332617-communists-address-putin-with-own/\" target=\"_blank\">pro-Putin United Russia</a> party scrambling in this election cycle to outflank the Communists&#8217; &#8220;anti-crisis program&#8221;\u00a0with populist measures such as raising the minimum wage and increasing pensions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our biggest problem is that the ruling party keeps stealing our ideas,&#8221; says Listov. &#8220;Of course they&#8217;re not solid or systematic about it, it&#8217;s just populism. But it shows what they are afraid of. People are hurting, and they know who is the most reliable defender of living standards and social equality in this country. And we are not going away.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/russias-communist-party-is-growing-again-but-can-it-be-a-potential-vehicle-of-social-change-34998/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Fake Encounters Sowed the Wind and India is Reaping the Whirlwind</title>\n\t\t<link>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/fake-encounters-sowed-the-wind-and-india-is-reaping-the-whirlwind-35458/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/fake-encounters-sowed-the-wind-and-india-is-reaping-the-whirlwind-35458/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:28:34 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Prem Shankar Jha]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Government]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Law]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Police]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Amit Shah]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Assam]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[dacoits]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Encounters]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ishrat Jahan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kashmir]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Khalistan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Narendra Modi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nirmala Sitharaman]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Punjab]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Satish Verma]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tamang]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[terrorism]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[V.P.

The first was that it had \u2018created a charade\u2019, of an innocent girl being killed in cold blood by a brutalised police, when it knew from its own intelligence inputs that she had been a member of the Lashkar-e Taiba cell that had been sent from Pakistan to kill chief minister Narendra Modi. As my <a href=\"http://thewire.in/2016/05/05/police-encounters-are-the-dirty-side-of-indian-democracy-33787/\">article in The Wire showed last week </a>this was pure political jousting.</p>\n<p>But in the furore that followed Sitharaman\u2019s second, more serious, allegation slipped into peoples\u2019 minds through the cracks created by the first. This was that by unleashing the CBI on the case, and allowing it to interrogate officers and men of the Gujarat police endlessly in their search for evidence with which to discredit the Modi government, the UPA had divided and demoralised the police and security agencies, and harmed the country\u2019s security.</p>\n<p>To make this accusation Sitharaman glossed over the fact that the CBI had had to be brought in because the reaction of the Gujarat government to affidavits presented to the Gujarat High Court by two \u2018whistleblowers\u2019 in the government, S.P. Tamang, chief metropolitan magistrate of Ahmedabad, and Satish Verma, member of the Special Investigation Team set up by the Gujarat high court after it received Tamang\u2019s report, showed that it had no intention of indicting its own police personnel.</p>\n<p>Both had presented evidence to the court that the four had been killed in cold blood at least six hours earlier, and that whatever the other three might have been, Ishrat Jahan <em>could not possibly have been</em> a Lashkar terrorist.</p>\n<p><strong>Debate on faked encounters</strong></p>\n<p>When Gandhinagar took no action it left the Centre with two choices: turn a blind eye, or turn the case over to the CBI. It started out to do the former but in 2009, with faked encounters in Punjab, Assam and Kashmir already a subject of anguished debate in the country and media empowered by satellite TV and internet, this option was closed. Embarrassing Modi was a bonus.</p>\n<p>Why did Gandhinagar make itself complicit in the killings? The short answer is that by 2009 faked encounters had become a part of India\u2019s unwritten code of criminal justice. When the Ahmedabad CBI court dismissed the CBI\u2019s charges against former home minister Amit Shah, he did not say \u201cGod and our courts are just, I have been vindicated\u201d. He said , \u201cthese accusations were politically motivated. There have been far more encounters in other states. Gujarat has had the fewest encounters, and also has one of the best records in maintaining peace.\u201d Why, he asked in short, were we singled out?</p>\n<p>However repugnant one may find his reasoning, it would be less than just to dismiss it out of hand, because \u2018encounters\u2019 have been the Indian State\u2019s way of dealing with dangerous criminals and insurgents since well before independence. In the 1920s Sultana Daku was caught and hanged by the British under due process of law, but large numbers of others simply disappeared. After independence, in its half century long bid to clear the Chambal ravines the Madhya Pradesh Police <a href=\"http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130407/jsp/7days/story_16756788.jsp#.Vy6jMeJ96Uk\">killed more than 500 dacoits</a>. A majority, police sources told me then, were killed after being captured. It was to avoid this fate that others surrendered.</p>\n<p>In 1980 and 1981, during the chief ministership of V.P. Singh, the UP police killed more than 2,000 dacoits in Uttar Pradesh. The newspapers of the time were rife with accusations of fake encounters and the deaths of innocents. But that campaign did curb the menace of dacoity in the state and open the way for its development.</p>\n<p><strong>Integral part of counter insurgency</strong></p>\n<p>In more recent years fake encounters have become an integral part of counter insurgency operations in Punjab, Kashmir and the North-East. In Punjab, in particular, this policy was forced upon the police by the acute shortcomings of the criminal justice system, and by the insurgents practice of killing judges, and the families of high profile policemen to paralyse the this criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>The insurgencies have all but ended, but the practice of letting the police be the judges and executioners of persons considered too dangerous to allow back onto the streets, has taken on a life of its own. Today, dozens of bodies are being recovered from the state\u2019s irrigation canals every week. <a href=\"http://punjabnewsexpress.com/punjab/news/mystery-shrouds-floating-dead-bodies-in-punjab-canal-nhrc-takes-notice--48716.aspx\">According to Inderjit Singh Jaijee, the human rights activist who brought this to light</a>, many are farmers who have committed suicide, but the majority are what he terms \u2018missing people\u2019. At a time when Punjab is being overwhelmed by drug smugglers with powerful political patrons, the possibility that many of these are captured drug smugglers cannot be ruled out.</p>\n<p>Initially Kashmir suffered less from the disease of fake encounters than Punjab. But, contrary to what Kashmiris had expected, fake encounters, extortion and other crimes committed by the police multiplied after 1996, when the elected government shifted the responsibility of \u2018mopping up\u2019 the remaining \u2018terrorists\u2019 from the security forces to the police. Today it is their frequent misuse of power in the rural areas, and continuation of the bestial practice, also adopted in Punjab, of awarding prize money to those who bring in the heads of alleged terrorists, that is mainly responsible for the resurgence of terrorism in South Kashmir.</p>\n<p>In Gujarat, the growing disquiet in civil society was not stoked, much less manufactured, by the Congress. It became the focus of civil society\u2019s disquiet because none of the conditions that had made people condone the shortcuts employed by other state governments existed there. Gujarat did not face an insurrection, and the handful of home grown and imported terrorists who came there after the 2002 riots had not even tried to kill judges or policemen\u2019s family members.</p>\n<p><strong>Turf wars between smugglers</strong></p>\n<p>It had a large and variegated Muslim population with a prosperous middle class component. The communal riots that it had experienced every few years since 1969 had been triggered by turf wars between rival gangs of smugglers and illicit liquor vendors, and not religious passion. Had the riots of 2002 not taken place the state would in all probability, have remained entirely free of terrorism and encounters, whether genuine or fake.</p>\n<p>The Godhra train burning and the riots that followed changed everything for they were the very first to be covered by television. Previously people had only read circumscribed reports. This time millions actually saw the burnt bogey of the Sabarmati express and the corpses being carried out from it. Nearly 2,000 people died in the riots that followed, and for the first time the killing was fanned by pure communal hatred.</p>\n<p>Without waiting for an enquiry Modi and his cabinet jumped to the conclusion that the Godhra train burning was the work of Muslim terrorists and adopted a pro-active policy of prevention <em>in anticipation of</em> terrorist reprisals.</p>\n<p>The custodial killings that occurred between 2002 and 2005 ,for which 32 police officers and men await trial today, were the outcome of that policy. They were therefore not only morally indefensible, but actually increased the threat of a future communal insurrection by showing Muslim youth how casually their fundamental right to life could be taken away from them.</p>\n<p>Nirmala Sitharaman is right when she says that the controversy over the Gujarat encounter killings has demoralised the security apparatus of the country and seriously weakened it\u2019s security. But curiously enough, the officers and men indicted for them blame the Modi government, and not the Congress for their plight.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanzara&#8217;s letter</strong></p>\n<p>Their monumental sense of betrayal was captured by D.G. Vanzara, director-general of Gujarat\u2019s\u00a0anti-terrorism force and widely known as its \u2018encounter specialist\u2019, in the <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Read-DG-Vanzaras-letter/articleshow/22262722.cms\">letter of resignation</a> from the India Police Service, that he wrote from jail on September 1 2013. Forfeiting all his post-retirement benefits Vanzara wrote:</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>To the best of my knowledge, nowhere in any part of the country, such a big number of police officers were/are arrested and continuously being kept in the jails for such a long period of time except in the state of Gujarat. The most notable part of the whole episode is that they are made to suffer in the jails, inspite of the fact that they had been, and are, loyal soldiers of this government who fought incessant war against Pakistan inspired terrorism with complete honesty, integrity and sincerity without falling prey to any of the mundane temptations&#8230;. </em></p>\n<p><em>With the passage of time, I realized that</em> <em>this government was not only not interested in protecting us but it also has been clandestinely making all efforts to keep me and my officers in the jail so as to save its own skin from CBI on one hand and gain political benefits on the other\u2026</em>..</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>I, therefore, would like to categorically state in the most unequivocal words that the officers and men of Crime Branch, ATS and Border Range, during the period of years between 2002 to 2007, simply acted and performed their duties in compliance of the conscious policy of this government</em> &#8230; <em>we</em> <em>have simply implemented the conscious policy of this government which was inspiring, guiding and monitoring our actions from the very close quarters.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Vanzara\u2019s letter contains no tinge of remorse, but also none of communal rancour:</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>A monstrous episode of Godhra train burning and equally horrible post-Godhra riots in Gujarat provided a pretext to Pakistan based terrorist outfits like Let, JeM and D gang under the direct supervision of ISI, to &#8220;convert Gujarat into another Kashmir&#8221; by exploiting the sentiments of the muslims all over the world.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Listing 14 bomb blasts, five assassination attempts and two fidayeen attacks on the Rath Yatra and the Swaminarayan temple at Akshardham, he concludes: <em>\u201cI can say with pride that my officers and men not only successfully prevent(ed) Gujarat from becoming another Kashmir, but were also instrumental in providing a solid atmosphere of durable peace and security in the state\u201d. </em></p>\n<p>The bulk of the letter is a violent diatribe against the Modi government, and Amit Shah in particular, for having abandoned his police force when it most needed their support.</p>\n<p><em>\u201c</em><em>This government suddenly became vibrant and displayed a spur of sincere activities only when Shri Amitbhai Shah, former MOS, Home, was arrested by CBI. It (engaged) Shri Ram Jethmalani, the most learned, senior most and highest paid advocate of India &#8230; and got him released on regular bail within (the) record time of 3 months of his imprisonment.</em><em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>In contrast, when I, along with Rajkumar Pandian and Dinesh M.N, was arrested by the CID Crime, forget about providing the legal services, nobody from the government bothered even to provide a lip service to us or to our family members.\u00a0</em><em> (The) Gujarat police &#8230; used to be one of the finest &#8230; in the country till the coronation of this government in Gandhinagar. Today the same proud police &#8230; stands totally shattered and demoralized (by)&#8230;.. the continuous betrayal of jailed police officers since last six years\u201d.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Gujarat is not the only state in which the police feel betrayed. Within weeks of the end of the Khalistan insurgency in 1993 the Punjab police was assailed by a spate of indictments for carrying out fake encounters. The feeling of betrayal this generated in the police was highlighted when a senior superintendent of Police, A.S Sandhu, threw himself in front of a train to express his protest.</p>\n<p><strong>Re-instating indicted policemen</strong></p>\n<p>Today the Modi government is frantically trying to make amends by bailing out and re-instating indicted police officers. P.P. Pandey, police commissioner of Ahmedabad in 2004, was not merely released but is now the director general of police in Gujarat. Former assistant commissioner of police ( crime) in Ahmedabad, N.K. Amin, has been made the superintendent of Police for Mahisagar district.</p>\n<p>Vanzara, who was released on bail in December 2014 on condition that he did not enter Gujarat, has been allowed to do so . He was greeted with flowers on his return to his village by no less eminent a person that DGP P.P Pandey, and is now being wooed by the BJP to join politics, while still being indicted for murder.</p>\n<p>Modi does not seem to realise that the further the government goes down this road the more will India become a country that is not only without law, but one that flaunts its disregard for the very concept of law. When this realisation sinks in abroad, India will become not only an economic but also a political pariah.</p>\n<p>This must not happen. The first requirement for containing and repairing the damage that has already been done is for all political parties to admit their culpability and jointly resolve never again to allow anyone in police custody to be killed, or punished in any other way, than through the due process of the law. Existing laws, like the National Security Act, allow incarceration for long periods. Prisoners deemed to be too dangerous to be incarcerated in their home state can be sent to jails in distant parts of the country. If it is deemed necessary to protect judges and witnesses, trials can also be held in these locations, and conducted in camera.</p>\n<p>None of this involves rocket science. If it hasn\u2019t been done so far\u2014if government after government has continued to take the easy route of killing inconvenient prisoners, it is because clever lawyers have made a fine art out of subverting justice by raising procedural issues that make trials last forever. As Pakistan is showing with its 21<sup>st</sup> constitutional amendment and military tribunals, this too can be got around, although at some cost in terms of fairness and equity. But some legal process, however restricted, is a huge improvement over sanctioned, extra-judicial murder.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/fake-encounters-sowed-the-wind-and-india-is-reaping-the-whirlwind-35458/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Education Hasn&#8217;t Diminished India\u2019s Preference For Boys</title>\n\t\t<link>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/education-hasnt-diminished-indias-preference-for-boys-35483/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/education-hasnt-diminished-indias-preference-for-boys-35483/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:15:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Tanay Sukumar]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Education]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Women]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[abortion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Census]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Census 2011]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[female foeticide]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[female literacy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[first-born children]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[higher education]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[pregnancies]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[sex ratio]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[urbanisation]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://thewire.in/?p=35483</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The sex ratio of children ever-born (that is, including children who died at birth or later) to all women was 895 in rural areas but 878 in urban areas.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The sex ratio of children ever-born (that is, including children who died at birth or later) to all women was 895 in rural areas but 878 in urban areas.</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_35553\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35553\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3677733159_2e2c7bec4b_b.jpg?resize=1024%2C685\" alt=\"Haritha, a pupil, and her mother look at a map of England in a Chennai classroom, 2009.

This, for a Parsi living outside the cocoons of Mumbai and Gujarat is in itself quite amazing, and for the people of Delhi, where Parsis are such a tiny minority, a total revelation.</p>\n<p>The original inspiration for these exhibitions came from an academic exhibition and conference held at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London, called \u201cThe Everlasting Flame: Zoroastrianism in History and Imagination,\u201d from October to December 2013. This was followed by two exhibitions of a totally different kind in Mumbai, in December of the same year, for the World Zoroastrian Congress titled \u201cAcross the Oceans and Flowing Silks from Canton to Bombay 18th\u00a0to 20th\u00a0Centuries\u201d and \u201cNo Parsi is an Island\u201d.</p>\n<p>Although people did go and see these exhibitions, they were minuscule in number. Shernaz Cama, who was the coordinator of the SOAS exhibition and belongs to PARZOR \u2013 a UNESCO initiative for the preservation of Parsi Zoroastrian culture \u2013 wanted the reach of the exhibitions to be much broader. Meanwhile, the ministry of minority affairs asked if they could promote a Parsi initiative. Cama immediately suggested mounting exhibitions on Parsis. The National Museum, the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) and the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) were asked to make dates available and the curators to choose their locations.</p>\n<p>The results are happily here for all to see.</p>\n<p>What is Zoroastrianism? Who are the Parsis?</p>\n<p>Having been born and brought up in Delhi, these were questions I was often asked, even though Parsis had begun to weave themselves into the fabric of the city. I remember giving the oft-quoted, and in all probability mythical story, of refugees from Iran landing in Gujarat between the 8th\u00a0and the 10th\u00a0centuries and hence speaking Gujarati and wearing the sari Gujarati style. Growing up, one had one\u2019s <em>Navjot</em> (initiation ceremony), learnt by rote prayers in a language that was dead, discovered a bit more when on holiday in Bombay to meet relatives \u2013 and that was about it.</p>\n<p>These exhibitions have finally given us as a community an understanding of where we came from, who we were, what we have made of ourselves over these centuries, and above all where we are headed.</p>\n<p><strong>A vast expanse of time and space</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cThe Everlasting Flame\u201d at the National Museum is a visual narrative of the history of Zoroastrianism.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_35493\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-35493 size-full\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fire-Temple.jpeg?resize=300%2C168\" alt=\"The Fire Temple. Credit: Shernaz Italia\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Fire Temple. Credit: Shernaz Italia</p></div>\n<p>The most interesting feature of the exhibition perhaps, for non-Parsis, is the replica of a Fire Temple \u2013 the inner sanctum (where non-Parsis are not allowed), the objects used, the clothes a priest wears and of course the fire. Playing softly in the background, like a hypnotic chant, are the prayers.</p>\n<p>The first exhibit is a tablet from 2100 BC. Interestingly, it tells of payment to women in \u201cPearls of Barley\u201d. So, was there egalitarianism then? The Cyrus Cylinder, which comes much later, is now considered the first Declaration of Human Rights; yet, there is this tablet and barley is a grain used to this day.</p>\n<p>The exhibition takes one through the various Persian empires \u2013 Achaemenian, Parthian, Sassanian. At their prime they were larger than the Roman, Egyptian and Greek empires. Yet hardly anything is known about them. There are over 300 objects spanning several centuries and originating from an area stretching across Europe, Central Asia, India and China.</p>\n<p>On exhibit from The Hermitage museum in St. Petersburg are murals from the excavations at Penjikent near Samarkand, and at Samarkand itself. The Hermitage has been conducting these excavations since 1947. Many of the paintings, murals and artefacts painstakingly restored are devoted to the epic of Rostam. Also on exhibit is a series of paintings called the \u201cAmbassador\u2019s Paintings\u201d that show an unusual depiction of Navroze.</p>\n<p>The exhibition features ancient manuscripts from the British Museum; exquisitely calligraphed and illustrated copies of the Shahanameh; coins that date back to ancient Persia, Akbar and Jahangir; terracotta plates and figurines; remnants of pottery; engraved silver and bronze plaques; bowls; vases; horns; plates, and of course, the majesty of Persepolis.</p>\n<p>There are beasts real and imagined, elegant columns, graceful arches, and staircases ending in the sky. The exhibition covers a vast expanse of time and space.</p>\n<p><strong>From monochrome to colour</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_35480\" style=\"width: 283px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jhabla.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35480\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jhabla.jpeg?resize=273%2C184\" alt=\"A jhabla on display.

Credit: Shernaz Italia</p></div>\n<p>After these spectacular exhibits, we enter a room called \u201cThe Parsi Salon\u201d or the \u201cRed Salon.\u201d (Finally some familiarity!) Confronting us are original <em>garas</em>, or saris with Chinese embroidery on Gaggi silk \u2013 family heirlooms in most Parsi houses \u2013 <em>jabhlas</em>, a smock-like blouse that all of us wore as children, and sets of traditional Persian <em>shalwar</em> and <em>kamiz</em> that have been worn from ancient times into the present. Surrounding the rich costumes are commissioned artworks by famous practitioners of the J.J. School of Art, mainly portraits of the rich and famous.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_35603\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-35603 size-medium\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Parsi-Salon.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"The Red Salon.

Credit: Shernaz Italia</p></div>\n<p>Oddly enough, it is this room that has also drawn criticism by some for being out of sync with the rest of the exhibition. The main reason for this is that the aesthetics of Zoroastrianism are austere, spare, and monochromatic. But here in this room, we are suddenly surrounded by colour and modern aesthetics. The room has been a hit with visitors, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Painted encounters</strong></p>\n<p>The NGMA features two exhibitions of paintings, called \u201cPainted Encounters, Parsi Traders and the Community\u201d and \u201cNo Parsi is an Island\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cPainted Encounters\u201d is for me a kind of visual translation of Amitav Ghosh\u2019s <em>River of Smoke</em>, which describes Parsi trade with China. Curated by Pheroza J. Godrej and Firoza Punthakey Mistree, the works, numbering over two hundred, take us from the emergence of the Parsi traders to their presence as a force to reckon with in the early colonial world. Traditionally, Zoroastrianism, and indeed Zoroastrians, had never been exclusive. They not only welcomed people into their faith but also respected others following their own. The Persian Empire actually opened up the Silk Route from Persia, through central Asia and India, up to China. In the 18th\u00a0and early 19th\u00a0centuries, the Parsi merchant with an innate ability to shift comfortably between several languages and firmly ensconced within the British Raj, expanded trade from India to China, West Asia and Europe. Parsi traders comprised one of the most important mercantile communities, developing links with the European traders very early on. They were also instrumental in building the dockyards and ships to facilitate that trade. Canton was the end point.</p>\n<p>The exhibition starts with pictures of clippers, mainly carriers of opium over the seas to Canton, and of the factories \u2013 called Hongs \u2013 at Canton or Guanghzou. Some of the paintings in the collection are by William Daniell, characterised by his precision and eye for detail. He depicts the boats of the Chinese boat people that supplied the Hongs with food, vegetables and fruit, transporting them out to the clippers that waited to take them back to Bombay. We have here outstanding panoramic views \u2013 detailed maps, exteriors of buildings, interiors of Courts of Justice, the Pearl River delta \u2013 and paintings on glass, ivory inlaid with gilt, paper and canvas, as well as pictures of Surat and Bombay, as they were then.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_35482\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Opium-Factory-at-Ghazipur.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35482\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Opium-Factory-at-Ghazipur.jpg?resize=630%2C361\" alt=\"Opium factory at Ghazipur.

We view homes of Chinese merchants in intricate detail. There are also descriptions of the food these merchants served at banquets, such as this one: \u201cBird\u2019s nest soup with plover eggs, jellies of every kind, roast suckling pig, roast duck, shark\u2019s fin, abalone, sea cucumber, jelly fish, sea food of every kind, ribs delicately prepared with apricots, squabs, duck eggs, snow fungus, winter melon and roasted snails\u201d.</p>\n<p>There are portraits of the merchants, lithographs of the opium factory at Patna (it is actually at Ghazipur), and household items \u2013 beds, chests and the blue and white porcelain of Canton.</p>\n<p>After this extravagant journey, we return to India, to Surat, where it all began for the Parsis in the 17th\u00a0century, when they became brokers and commission agents for the Dutch and British. This beginning comes to life in the exhibited paintings of early brokers, a Dutch cemetery, an old British factory and early Bombay.</p>\n<p>It is very hard to dispute the close association between the Parsis and the city of Bombay, which bears clear testimony to their contribution.</p>\n<p>The last part of the exhibition concerns the early Parsis of Bombay \u2013 the Wadias, the Jejeebhoys, the Petits, the Readymoneys and the Tatas. Beautiful portraits of them and their families, and paintings of their homes and clothes, are a fitting tribute to them.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_35500\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2816.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-35500\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2816.jpg?resize=750%2C500\" alt=\"Portraits.

She asked them whether they were interested in taking the narrative forward. Nancy, who calls herself a \u201cCultural Parsi,\u201d said they would be happy to do so, but emphasised that they were not interested in portraying a limited, insular understanding of the Parsi community. This was how the title \u201cNo Parsi is an Island\u201d was conceptualised. Ironically enough, Pheroza, Nancy and Ranjit later had an argument over this title with other curators, who rather liked the idea of Parsis being an island!</p>\n<p>The exhibition allowed the curators to think about how artists of Parsi origin negotiated the interior world of that community and the cosmopolitan landscape that was opening up. It thus depicts the artists as working in contexts wider than just their art, giving glimpses of how they intervened in civic activism and the conversations in which they partook, such as those between the largely-forgotten Adi Davierwalla and Piloo Pochkhanawala.</p>\n<p>After the British took over post the 1857 revolt, much thought was put into meaningfully and gainfully employing the masses and inculcating within them a European way of thinking. Art schools comprised one of the mediums through which this was done. Foremost amongst the new art schools was the Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy School of Art in Mumbai, which holds pride of place to this day. Amongst the first to be trained at J.J. School of Art was Pestonjee Bomanjee, who enrolled as a sculptor under John Lockwood Kipling, the father of Rudyard. The friezes at the entrance of Crawford Market building, now almost invisible because hidden by vendors\u2019 wares, were designed by J. L. Kipling and executed by his students. From the 2nd\u00a0half of the 19th\u00a0century to the present, artists of Parsi origin have participated actively in the domains and debates of Indian art, the three curators of this exhibition themselves being prominent amongst them.</p>\n<p>Across both these exhibitions, we can see that westernisation took root and grafted itself rather easily into the Parsi thought process. Bomanjee\u2019s paintings are often ethnographic depictions of Parsis of that time \u2013 their clothes, customs and homes.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the existence of a large collection of Parsi portraits can be attributed to the wealth gained by Parsi traders during the 19th\u00a0century in Canton, and also documents their evolving tastes at the time. As they emulated the British, subtle changes in their fashion, lifestyle, furniture, Cantonese porcelain, and business style came about.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_35503\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2836.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-35503\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2836.jpg?resize=750%2C500\" alt=\"A view of the exhibits.

Credit: Shernaz Italia</p></div>\n<p><strong>Threads of Continuity</strong></p>\n<p>The title of the exhibition at the IGNCA &#8220;Threads of Continuity,&#8221; which is curated by Cama, Ashen Lilaowala, Dadi Pudumjee and Kritika Mudgal, evokes the very heart of Zoroastrianism by referring to the sacred thread called <em>kasti</em>. \u201cThreads weave together the material and the spiritual in a cosmic Aiwyaonghana or bond of unification,\u201d says Cama.</p>\n<p>The cosmic tree of life at the centre of the exhibition is made of 72 threads that signify the 72 chapters of the <em>Yasna,</em> the text that forms the basis of the Zoroastrian \u201cFaith in Action\u201d culture, of which the Zoroastrian tenet of \u201cHumata, Hukta, Huvarashta,\u201d or \u201cGood Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds,\u201d is the guiding force. As we walk through the exhibition, it becomes apparent that while some threads are physical and tangible, many others are metaphorical. All of them bind Zoroastrians to their past and will, hopefully, guide their future.</p>\n<p>Beyond the tree of life, we find the section on Cyrus the Great, whose tomb was desecrated by Alexander\u2019s soldiers and on which was the poignant inscription: \u201cO men, I am Cyrus, son of Cambyses, founder of the Persian Empire\u2026 Grudge me not these few feet of land to lay my body as I was once the Master and Emperor of Asia.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting items following this section is a picture and reproduction of a water harvesting system called the Badgir. Another outstanding replica is of the statue of Darius with a missing upper body. The pleats on his robe are inscribed along the right-hand side in cuneiform in three official languages of the empire, Persian, Elamite and Babylonian, and along the left-hand side in Egyptian hieroglyphs. The king is wearing a Persian dress with a dagger in his belt.</p>\n<p>From Yazd, Iran, we come to the present day. Most strikingly, we view the original <em>firman</em> signed by Abdul Fazl and stamped with the royal seal, granting land as a gift to the first Dastoor Meherjirana at Fatehpur Sikri during Akbar\u2019s reign. We also view images of Parsi homes, establishments and <em>garas,</em> and portraits of the rich and famous.</p>\n<p>A flame sparked by a Bronze Age prophet has burned through known history. A civilisation and its tradition have endured, its thread unbroken.</p>\n<p>It is a community that is now at a crossroads, faced with choices about which route to take. The Zoroastrians have been just one thread in the tapestry of humanity, yet their pioneering spirit has made them a vital part of the warp and weft. A philosophy that has always respected all creation, not just man and woman, and that values compassion and justice above all, can only continue to offer the promise for a better life.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thewire.in/2016/05/12/threads-of-continuity-three-exhibitions-on-parsi-life-and-culture-35466/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n\n<!-- Dynamic page generated in 0.532 seconds. -->\n<!-- Cached page generated by WP-Super-Cache on 2016-05-13 12:13:16 -->\n",
