But too many athletes seem oblivious to that fact, as the constant stream of positive drug tests in sports attests.</p>\n<p>Houston Texans offensive tackle Duane Brown got caught up in the drug testing trap last fall, when he was suspended for 10 games by the NFL for violating the league&#8217;s performance-enhancing drugs policy. But he beat the rap, getting the suspension <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Texans-Duane-Brown-wins-appeal-of-PED-7391332.php\" target=\"_blank\">overturned on appeal</a> by claiming he ate too much meat on a trip to Mexico.</p>\n<p>Yeah, right, Mexican meat made him test dirty. Well, actually, maybe it did. Brown had tested positive for the steroid-like substance clenbutrol, but won his appeal by presenting evidence that some meat produced in Mexico and China was contaminated with the substance. He produced receipts showing he ate at least 10 hamburgers and two steaks during his weeklong vacation there last fall.</p>\n<p>Now, that was a good excuse. Other athletes have tried creative excuses for positive drug tests, but unlike Brown, they didn&#8217;t have any evidence to support their claims. Here are 10 world-class athletes with really whack excuses for testing dirty and no receipts to back them up.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Mark Bosnich</strong>. The goalkeeper for Chelsea&#8217;s soccer team was suspended for nine months in 2002 after testing positive for cocaine. He explained that, yes, he had used the drug, but only to teach his wife a lesson. &#8220;I told her that for every line of cocaine she took, I would take two, and that&#8217;s exactly what I did.&#8221; Years later, he admitted he had a bad cocaine habit.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Melky Cabrera</strong>. The San Francisco Giants outfielder tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs in 2012, was suspended for 50 games, and went to extraordinary lengths to explain it away. Cabrera paid someone $10,000 to create a fake website selling fake products, then claimed he accidentally ingested performance-enhancing drugs via a fictional product obtained on the website. Major League Baseball and the FBI managed to trace the website back to Cabrera.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Richard Gasquet</strong>. The French tennis player tested positive for cocaine in May 2009 and dropped out of a tournament because of the positive test. But that didn&#8217;t stop him from trying to claim he came up dirty because he made out with a woman who had snorted some at a local nightclub.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Ben Johnson</strong>. The Canadian sprinter won Olympic gold in 1988 only to see it stripped away after he tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. He claimed someone had spiked his energy drink. He was suspended for three years, during which time he admitted injecting steroids, and was later hit with a lifetime ban after failing a drug test again in 1993.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Tyler Hamilton</strong>. The U.S. cyclist was nailed for blood doping in 2004, but tried to blame the foreign blood on a &#8220;vanishing twin&#8221; he had absorbed into his own body before birth. Tyler tested positive for blood doping numerous times. The cycling teammate of Lance Armstrong eventually admitted to doping and wrote a book about its prevalence in the world of cycling.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Floyd Landis</strong>. Landis won the 2006 Tour de France, but was disqualified after testing revealed high levels of testosterone. First he blamed the test results on drinking too much whisky the night before, but when doctors said that was impossible, he went full brazen: &#8220;The levels that I&#8217;ve had during the tour and all my career are natural and produced by my own organism.&#8221; Landis later &#8216;fessed up to continual doping and also outed Lance Armstrong and other top riders as dopers.</p>\n<p><strong>7. LaShawn Merritt</strong>. Merritt won Olympic gold as a sprinter in 2008, but was suspended for two years after failing three drug tests in 2009 and 2010. He blamed a penis-enhancement medication called ExtenZe. &#8220;Any penalty I may receive for my actions will not overshadow the embarrassment and humiliation that I feel inside.&#8221; Indeed.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Dennis Mitchell</strong>. The American sprinter and 1992 Olympic gold medal winner as part of the 400-meter relay team tested positive for high levels of testosterone in 1998. His defense was that his maleness was up because he had five beers and had sex with his wife five times the night before. &#8220;It was her birthday. The lady deserved a treat,&#8221; he explained.</p>\n<p><strong>9. North Korea Women&#8217;s Soccer Team</strong>. At the 2011 World Cup, five members of the team tested positive for steroids. Their handlers&#8217; explanation was that the players had been struck by lightning and had to resort to a traditional Chinese remedy involving deer musk glands to recover. The authorities weren&#8217;t buying it; the players were suspended and the team was banned from the 2015 World Cup.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Javier Sotomayor</strong>. The Cuban high jumper won the gold at the 1999 Pan American Games, but was stripped of his prize after testing positive for cocaine. Sotomayor suggested he was set up by someone trying to make Cuba look bad, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro seconded that notion, blaming the &#8220;Cuban-American mafia.&#8221; Sotomayor was suspended for a year, then tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug in 2001, effectively ending his career.</p>\n<p><em>[This article first appeared on <a

He put the gun that was used in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin for sale on GunBroker.com \u2014 with a starting bid of $5,000. The post was followed by a personal statement by Zimmerman which read, in part:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Prospective bidders, I am honored and humbled to announce the sale of an American Firearm Icon. The firearm for sale is the firearm that was used to defend my life and end the brutal attack from Trayvon Martin on 2/26/2012. The gun is a Kel-Tec PF-9 9mm. It has recently been returned to me by the Department of Justice. The pistol currently has the case number written on it in silver permanent marker. Many have expressed interest in owning and displaying the firearm including The Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C. This is a piece of American History.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>The auction page was terminated right before bidding was set to start.\u00a0This is just the latest in the\u00a0painful episode of a human scum\u00a0striving\u00a0to\u00a0remain in the spotlight. From domestic violence 911 calls to road rage shooting incidents to selling artwork, we take a look back at Zimmerman&#8217;s most scum-worthy moments since he walked free from killing unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</p>\n]]><p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/5_times_george_zimmerman_proved_hes_total_human_scum/\">Read More...</a></p></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/5_times_george_zimmerman_proved_hes_total_human_scum/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>&#8220;Smashing&#8221; Sanders: Billy Corgan rips Bernie on Alex Jones&#8217; radio show</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/smashing_sanders_billy_corgan_rips_bernie_on_alex_jones_radio_show/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/smashing_sanders_billy_corgan_rips_bernie_on_alex_jones_radio_show/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 20:35:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Antoaneta Roussi]]></dc:creator>\n\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Social]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Media]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Life]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[All Salon]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Alex Jones' show]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bernie Sanders]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill Corgan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[KKK]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Smashing Pumpkins]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.salon.com/?p=14493888</guid>\n\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Corgan said he can't believe it's \"OK\" that a socialist is seriously running for president]]></description>\n\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"620\" height=\"412\" src=\"http://media.salon.com/2016/05/Bill-Corgan-Screenshot-620x412.jpg\" class=\"attachment-lg_horizontal wp-post-image\" alt=\"Bill Corgan Screenshot\" />\n<p>Billy Corgan\u00a0had strong words for Bernie Sanders when he appeared again\u00a0on the radio show of noted conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. In\u00a0<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/64926-billy-corgan-compares-social-justice-warriors-to-the-kkk/\" target=\"_blank\">an\u00a0interview\u00a0</a>\u00a0last month, the Smashing Pumpkins frontman\u00a0spoke\u00a0about &#8220;social justice warriors,&#8221; being similar to the KKK. This time his focus was on politics, as <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/65426-billy-corgan-disses-bernie-sanders-on-conspiracy-theorist-radio-show/\" target=\"_blank\">Pitchfork reported.</a></p>\n<p>As a\u00a0picture of Sanders\u00a0photoshopped as KFC&#8217;s Colonel Sanders with a bucket of chicken\u00a0emblazoned with the Soviet hammer and sickle played across the screen, Corgan said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I can\u2019t believe that we\u2019re even having this discussion, if you can understand when I say that to you humbly. To be talking in America in 2016 about Mao is a good idea, and a socialist is running for president and that\u2019s OK, and we\u2019re going to go back to these kind of crazy tax rates where we\u2019re going to completely disempower the innovators in the country because the new class, the new technocratic class wants to keep their position and they want to keep anybody else from coming in the game\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s just crazy to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Corgan\u00a0further expanded on his ideas about the current presidential race, including his feelings on protesters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have no respect for what these people are doing. I don&#8217;t. They&#8217;re shutting down free speech, they&#8217;re shutting down processes that&#8230; I just don&#8217;t get it. To me, it&#8217;s antithetical to the society that I believe in. As I said on Alex&#8217;s show, they&#8217;re eventually going to come after me. It&#8217;s just the way history works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Corgan also spoke\u00a0about the proliferation of drones, Facebook refusing to shut down pages\u00a0advocating violence against Trump, George Orwell&#8217;s &#8220;1984&#8221;\u00a0and &#8220;Animal Farm,&#8221; the importance of free speech, and more.\u00a0He also emphasized\u00a0that when he was talking about race and racism with regard to social justice movements, he was not targeting particular groups and that he outwardly condemns racism.

Burney, who is asthmatic, says that, in the officer\u2019s grip, he\u00a0was scared for his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cI felt like Eric Garner because I couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d says Burney, 18, referring to an incident that took place last Thursday. \u201cAnd I felt like I was going to die that day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Burney says that he needed to use the restroom immediately, and grew frustrated when the officer, who the school police union and district have <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160512_Student_accuses_school_police_officer_of_assault.html\">identified</a> as Jeffrey Maciocha, blocked his way because\u00a0he did not have\u00a0a pass. \u201cI really had to go bad,\u201d says Burney who, according to his mother,\u00a0has been hospitalized previously for asthma and has bladder problems. \u201cWe had words. I threw an orange at the wall out of frustration because I really had to go to the bathroom.\u201d\u00a0In a letter to parents, Principal Gregory Hailey put forward a somewhat a different account, saying that Burney \u201cgrew angry and threw an orange in the direction of the school police officer, causing the officer to restrain the student.\u201d</p>\n<p>The incident became public on Monday after the Philadelphia Student Union, a youth organizing group of which Burney is a member, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/165916479\">posted</a> a short video recorded by another student online.\u00a0Neither the School Police Association of Philadelphia nor Maciocha could be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>Much\u00a0is disputed, and the video only captured a few seconds of the incident, after the officer already had Burney on the ground. What isn&#8217;t disputed is that Burney suffered a concussion. But the School District of Philadelphia suggested that he\u00a0was to blame.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we know is that the student suffered a concussion from hitting his forehead on the floor,\u201d said District spokesperson Fernando Gallard. \u201cHe admitted to the nurse that he voluntarily smacked his forehead on the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Burney says that he did bang\u00a0his head on the ground but did so because \u201cI felt like I was going to die.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gallard said that the principal witnessed the officer restraining Burney, and that it wasn&#8217;t a chokehold, though the principal\u00a0did not witness the actual takedown.</p>\n<p>As for\u00a0Burney&#8217;s claim that he was punched, Gallard says\u00a0that the nurse found no abrasions around Burney\u2019s cheeks or eyes.\u00a0But Burney\u2019s mother, Joy Burney, says that her son\u2019s face indeed showed signs of assault, and that the school nurse gave him ice for his face. She says that the inflammation was still clear enough two days later that doctors at the emergency room X-rayed his face to make sure there were no fractures. <strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a student and he was treated as though he was a criminal in the street,\u201d says Joy Burney, \u201cfor committing the crime of wanting to use the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>School officials&#8217; behavior after the incident does not inspire confidence in their impartiality. The\u00a0student witness to the incident who recorded the brief video says that a second school police officer deleted it from his phone shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI felt like they wanted to cover it up,\u201d said the student, who spoke to Salon on the condition that their name not be used. It didn\u2019t work. One of the student&#8217;s\u00a0friends suggested that he check his Google backup. And there it was. The Philadelphia Student Union\u00a0<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/165916479\">posted it online</a> on Monday.</p>\n<p>Gallard, the school district spokesperson, confirms that the officer deleted the video: The student punched \u201cdelete,\u201d he emailed, and the officer hit the \u201cconfirm\u201d button. The officer appears to have\u00a0gone beyond what district policy allows.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe SPO did ask the student to erase the video,\u201d Gallard emailed. \u201cWe do not have a practice or policy regarding that. There is a policy in BFHS that prohibits the use of phone while in the school.\u201d</p>\n<p>It seems unclear from the very brief video whether Burney was placed in a chokehold. Gallard says that it clearly shows he was not, while the Student Union says that it shows that he was. Whatever the truth about the punches and the chokehold, however, the witness says that the takedown was excessive.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrian\u2019s a smaller guy, and the officer&#8217;s really big,\u201d said the student. \u201cI feel like he could have used way less force and restrained him just as effectively.\u201d</p>\n<p>Or maybe, he could have not restrained him at all.</p>\n<p>The School District says that an investigation is underway and that the officer has been transferred to a non-school site. But on Tuesday, Benjamin Franklin Principal Gregory Hailey sent a letter home to parents\u00a0putting forward the school police officer\u2019s perspective as \u201cthe facts.\u201d</p>\n<p>That struck Joy Burney as not exactly impartial.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was strange to me is it said these are &#8216;the facts&#8217; and then at the end of it said it&#8217;s still under investigation, and that this officer was removed,\u201d said Burney. \u201cHow are these facts if it\u2019s still under investigation?\u201d</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Pennsylvania\u00a0Auditor General Eugene DePasquale released an audit highlighting the district\u2019s ongoing financial crisis, and\u00a0also found that nearly half of all school police in a sample they reviewed had not been subjected to a full criminal background check. Philadelphia public schools, long struggling, spun into crisis after the previous governor, Republican Tom Corbett, deeply slashed education funding.</p>\n<p>Joy Burney is angry and wants justice for her child. She says that he is a good kid, and was in his ROTC uniform at the time he was assaulted. She wonders why they couldn\u2019t have just let him use the bathroom, and then written him up for not having a pass.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not one of those children. This is something I want to stress. Because I don\u2019t want it to look like this is just another black kid acting out\u2026he has never been in trouble,\u201d she says,\u00a0sounding as though she is\u00a0on the verge of tears. \u201cI\u2019m just irate. And I\u2019m not sitting down on this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear what\u2019s next for Brian. He works outside of school doing convention registration work for a temp company, and likely won\u2019t be returning to school any time soon.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to school until I feel comfortable, until I feel safer,\u201d says Burney. \u201cIf something happens to me they\u2019re going to allow it to happen.\u201d</p>\n]]><p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/i_felt_like_i_was_going_to_die_philly_students_allege_police_assault_over_bathroom_visit/\">Read More...</a></p></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/i_felt_like_i_was_going_to_die_philly_students_allege_police_assault_over_bathroom_visit/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Top 2 hedge fund managers bankroll Hillary Clinton and Rahm Emanuel, after making $1.7 billion each in 2015</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/top_2_hedge_fund_managers_bankroll_hillary_clinton_and_rahm_emanuel_after_making_1_7_billion_each_in_2015/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/top_2_hedge_fund_managers_bankroll_hillary_clinton_and_rahm_emanuel_after_making_1_7_billion_each_in_2015/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:18:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Norton]]></dc:creator>\n\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[All Salon]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[1 percent]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hedge funds]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Inequality]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[James Simons]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[kenneth griffin]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Rahm Emanuel]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.salon.com/?p=14493624</guid>\n\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Hedge fund managers James Simons and Kenneth Griffin have poured millions into the corporate Dems' campaigns]]></description>\n\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"620\" height=\"412\" src=\"http://media.salon.com/2016/05/hillary-clinton-rahm-emanuel-620x412.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-lg_horizontal wp-post-image\" alt=\"Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shares a laugh with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel during an event in Chicago\" />\n<p><em>Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with Mayor Rahm Emanuel at an event in Chicago, Illinois on June 11, 2014  (Credit: Reuters/Jim Young)</em></p>\n<p>James Simons and Kenneth Griffin were the world&#8217;s top two hedge fund managers in 2015. Each made $1.7 billion last year alone, and have used their massive wealth to bankroll the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Rahm Emanuel, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/10/hedge-fund-managers-salaries-billions-kenneth-griffin-james-simon\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>.</p>\n<p>Simons is the 50th richest person in the world, according to Forbes. The mathematician has made an estimated $15.5 billion as CEO of the Renaissance Technologies hedge fund, and is individually richer than many countries.</p>\n<p>He donated $13 million to support Ted Cruz&#8217;s failed presidential campaign, before jumping ship to back Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>Simons has pumped more than $2 million into Clinton&#8217;s campaign to date. And his family office, Euclidean Capital, has poured more than $7 million into supporting Clinton, the Guardian noted.</p>\n<p>Many other financial executives have joined Simons in funding Clinton. Powerful figures on Wall Street who formerly backed failed Republican candidates have instead <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/05/09/hillary_clinton_is_wall_streets_preferred_candidate_financial_execs_pouring_millions_into_her_campaign_to_defeat_trum/\" target=\"_blank\">thrown their weight behind the Democratic presidential front-runner</a>, hoping she can defeat presumed GOP nominee Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>Kenneth Griffin, the other top hedge fund manager in 2015,\u00a0is the founder and CEO of Citadel. He has an estimated $7.5 billion, making him the richest man in Illinois.</p>\n<p>Griffin calls himself a \u201cReagan Republican\u201d and insists the rich have \u201cinsufficient influence\u201d on U.S. politics.</p>\n<p>He donated more than $3 million to former Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, all of whom dropped out of the race.</p>\n<p>Griffin was also the biggest donor to Rahm Emanuel, who was re-elected for a second term as Chicago mayor, the Guardian highlighted.</p>\n<p>Emanuel is often seen as a symbol of the Democratic Party&#8217;s increasingly neoliberal, pro-corporate tendencies. When he endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, her opponent, self-declared democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, insisted he did not want Emanuel&#8217;s endorsement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to thank Rahm Emanuel for not endorsing me,&#8221; Sanders <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/03/12/ahead-illinois-primary-sanders-thanks-chicago-mayor-rahm-emanuel-not-endorsing-him\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;I don\u2019t want the endorsement of a mayor shutting down schools and firing teachers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Chicago mayor has faced bitter backlash from the left for closing 50 public schools and encouraging privatization. Griffin, on the other hand, complained that this wasn&#8217;t enough, and wished the candidate he funded had instead closed 125 public schools.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Simons and Griffin each made as much money as 112,000 Americans working full-time on the federal minimum wage.</p>\n<p>Together, the world\u2019s top 25 hedge fund managers made $13 billion in 2015, more than the entire economies of numerous countries, including the Bahamas and Nicaragua.</p>\n<p>These findings were published by Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine this week.</p>\n<p>The world&#8217;s richest 1 percent of people have as much wealth as the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35339475\" target=\"_blank\">rest of the world combined</a>, according to a study by Oxfam.</p>\n<p>The richest 62 people have as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population \u2014 3.6 billion people.

But one of the ads, featuring actress Klara Kristen, stands out from the titillating crowd. It&#8217;s a riff on the &#8220;upskirt&#8221; photos that are popular in the creepier corners of the internet, where misogynistic voyeurs share pictures they took up the skirts of unsuspecting women in public places.</p>\n<p>But unlike the real-life upskirt photos, where the creepers in question try to avoid detection from their targets, this photo shows Kristen looking directly at the photographer. And while she&#8217;s not smiling, she doesn&#8217;t seem angry, either. Maybe more intrigued&#8230;.perhaps<em> aroused</em>. &#8220;I flash in my Calvins,&#8221; the ad reads, suggesting that, even though she&#8217;s not supposed to admit it, Kristen <em>wants</em> you to look, you naughty boy.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-version=\"7\">\n<div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 62.4537037037% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFNCgKdRC4K/\" target=\"_blank\">Take a peek: @karate_katia, photographed by @harleyweir for the Spring 2016 advertising campaign. #mycalvins</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\">A photo posted by Calvin Klein (@calvinklein) on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2016-05-09T22:45:13+00:00\">May 9, 2016 at 3:45pm PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\" async=\"\" defer=\"defer\"></script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ad generated\u00a0a churn of moral outrage from all sides of the political spectrum.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Calvin Klein is marketing to perverts,&#8221;\u00a0<a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/05/12/calvin-klein-is-marketing-to-perverts/\" target=\"_blank\">a New York Post headline reads</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/fashion/calvin-klein-fire-controversial-upskirt-underwear-ad-article-1.2634590\" target=\"_blank\">People on social media</a> denounced the ad as &#8220;disgusting&#8221; and accused Calvin Klein of pandering to &#8220;pedophiles,&#8221; even though the actress is an adult woman in her 20s.</p>\n<p>In other words, the ad was a smashing success, doing exactly what it was no doubt intended to do: Paint the brand as sexy and daring.\u00a0By invoking sexual harassment, they can also market themselves as the brand to wear to signal that you&#8217;re a &#8220;chill girl&#8221;, i.e. the kind of girl desperately wants guys to know that she&#8217;s totally cool with you being gross and disrespectful to women, unlike those uptight feminists who are always yammering on about consent. (Neat trick of a sexist culture, convincing so many women that they need to have low self-esteem to be cool.)</p>\n<p>All of which is hilarious because, clothing-wise, Calvin Klein is anything but daring and sexy. On the contrary, they are the go-to brand when you need clothes that are conservative and unassuming, for those times you want to look nice without drawing any undue attention to your outfit, such as for job interviews or meeting your partner&#8217;s parents. It&#8217;s like Ann Taylor or the Banana Republic, except somehow even more boring. The gap between their oversexed marketing and the actual appeal of their clothes continues to be equal parts baffling and comical.</p>\n<p>Because generating feminist outrage is part of their marketing plan, I fully admit to hesitating before jumping into the fray. But sometimes the desire not to give the trolls what they want is outweighed by the need to\u00a0push back against egregious sexism, of the sort that is on display in this ad.</p>\n<p>So here we go: This ad is not actually daring at all. It is mired in one of the oldest and lamest\u00a0excuses for sexual harassment and abuse there is, which is that women secretly want it. Misogynists love to argue that\u00a0women\u00a0are afraid to act on our desires for fear of being called a slut, so we\u00a0<em>need</em> men to force \u00a0 us in order to realize our desires.</p>\n<p>This myth pops up time and time again, to justify everything from sexual harassment to rape. Women are told that we secretly love cat-calling and public voyeurism, but only pretend not to be flattered in order to &#8220;play the victim&#8221;. Rape victims are frequently told that they secretly wanted it, but are only &#8220;crying rape&#8221; afterwards to conceal their supposedly slutty ways.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many of you guys in your own experience with women have learned that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018yes\u2019 if you know how to spot it?,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/15/rush-limbaugh-consent_n_5824582.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rush Limbaugh complained recently on his radio program</a>.\u00a0\u201cIt used to be used as a clich\u00e9.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes, it did, but not because women who said no were secretly saying yes. It was because it was a more sexist time, and\u00a0society allowed this excuse to men who wanted to rape women and get away with it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to say that time has passed, but it clearly has not, and not just because a conservative crank like Limbaugh waxes on about what liars women supposedly are. For instance, &#8220;pick-up artist&#8221; communities online frequently use variations of the &#8220;no means yes&#8221; clich\u00e9 in order to justify and encourage each other to force sexual activity on women who have explicitly told them no.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are three concepts that are common through most PUA schools of thought: Anti-Slut Defense, Last Minute Resistance and Buyer\u2019s Remorse \u2013 and they\u2019re all toxic as fuck,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2013/06/trouble-pick-up-artists/\" target=\"_blank\">dating coach Harris O&#8217;Malley wrote</a> in a critique of the &#8220;pick-up artist&#8221; movement. &#8220;All three are based on the idea that\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2012/11/women-casual-sex-pleasure/\">women may\u00a0<em>want\u00a0</em>sex\u00a0</a>but they\u2019re socially conditioned to pretend that they\u00a0<em>don\u2019t</em>\u00a0for fear of appearing to be a slut.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He goes on to catalog some of the chilling behaviors that this &#8220;no means yes&#8221; philosophy is used to justify, including lying to women, bullying them for sex, and whipping your penis out and making her feel guilty if she doesn&#8217;t want to touch it. Some even argue that you should pressure and bully a woman for sex until she physically fights you off, and only then will you grudgingly accept that this could be a real &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>\n<p>All of which is why this Calvin Klein ad should not be regarded as rebellious or daring. On the contrary, it&#8217;s deeply conservative, in that it plays off old-fashioned and bigoted ideas about women being mendacious cock teases who\u00a0only pretend not to want it and therefore need to be forced.</p>\n<p>If they wanted to be genuinely daring, advertisers would make ads that portray women\u00a0as autonomous beings who both know what they want sexually and aren&#8217;t afraid to ask for it. Instead, we&#8217;ve got an ad that simply titillates while flattering the prejudices of the most retrograde misogynists out there. Rush Limbaugh probably loves this ad. What&#8217;s sexy about that?</p>\n]]><p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/sorry_calvin_klein_but_women_are_not_flattered_by_sexual_harassment/\">Read More...</a></p></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/sorry_calvin_klein_but_women_are_not_flattered_by_sexual_harassment/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>9/11 commission bombshell: Saudi officials supported attackers, says panel member</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/911_commission_bombshell_saudi_officials_supported_attackers_says_panel_member/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/911_commission_bombshell_saudi_officials_supported_attackers_says_panel_member/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Norton]]></dc:creator>\n\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[All Salon]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[9/11]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[9/11 commision]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[john lehman]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[President George W.

Lehman said in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/911-commission-saudi-arabia-hijackers?CMP=twt_gu\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> with the Guardian.</p>\n<p>He says at least five Saudi regime officials were strongly suspected of being involved in the al-Qaeda support network.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur report should never have been read as an exoneration of Saudi Arabia,\u201d Lehman said, referring to the 9/11 commission&#8217;s 2004 final report that minimized the Saudi regime&#8217;s alleged role.</p>\n<p>Although tepid, the 9/11 commission did criticize the closely U.S.-allied\u00a0theocratic Saudi monarchy for <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/01/06/saudi_arabia_funds_and_exports_islamic_extremism_the_truth_behind_the_toxic_u_s_relationship_with_the_theocratic_nation/\" target=\"_blank\">sponsoring the fundamentalist Wahhabi interpretation of Islam</a> embraced by extremists. It also acknowledged the Saudi royal family\u2019s ties to charity groups that supported al-Qaeda before 9/11, but claimed there was no evidence of links to the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>\n<p>Lehman, a Republican who served as secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration and is now an investment banker, says the report didn&#8217;t go far enough.</p>\n<p>He has joined several other commission members in calling on the Obama administration to promptly declassify the secret 28 pages of a congressional report that detail foreign support for the 9/11 al-Qaeda attackers.</p>\n<p>Former Sen. Bob Graham, who chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee during and after the 9/11 attacks, has repeatedly said these pages show Saudi involvement.</p>\n<p>This is the first sign of a public split among the 10 9/11 commissioners, reports the Guardian, in an explosive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/911-commission-saudi-arabia-hijackers?CMP=twt_gu\" target=\"_blank\">story</a> written by Philip Shenon, the author of &#8220;The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In April, the former chairman and vice chairman of the 9/11 commission praised oil-rich Saudi Arabia as a close &#8220;ally of the United States in combating terrorism&#8221; and asked the Obama administration to reconsider releasing the 28 pages, claiming they contain &#8220;raw, unvetted&#8221; information that could be misinterpreted.</p>\n<p>In reality, the U.S. government&#8217;s own <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/03/08/satire_is_dead_when_france_honors_the_theocratic_saudi_monarchy_for_countering_extremism_and_fighting_terrorism/\" target=\"_blank\">secret documents</a>, released by whistleblowing journalism organization Wikileaks, admit that \u201cSaudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qa\u2019ida, the Taliban, LeT, and other terrorist groups\u201d; and \u201cdonors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.\u201d</p>\n<p>The European Parliament has said the same, reporting \u201cSaudi Arabia has been a major source of financing to rebel and terrorist organisations since the 1970s.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Saudi regime also uses its vast oil wealth to buy influence. U.S. media outlets have recently devoted more and more attention to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/saudi-arabia-continues-hire-politically-connected-american-lobbyists-public-relation-firms/\" target=\"_blank\">investigating the millions of dollars</a> the Saudi monarchy spends on its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/04/20/saudi-government-has-vast-network-of-pr-lobby-firms-in-u-s/\" target=\"_blank\">vast network of public relations and lobby firms</a> in D.C.</p>\n<p>Of the 19 Sept. 11 attackers, 15 were citizens of Saudi Arabia. Zacarias Moussaoui, a convicted 9/11 plotter, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/03/politics/9-11-attacks-saudi-arabia-involvement/\" target=\"_blank\">confessed in sworn testimony</a> to U.S. authorities that members of the Saudi royal family funded al-Qaeda before the attacks. The Saudi monarchy strongly denies this.</p>\n<p>The chairman and vice-chairman of the 9/11 commission claimed the only Saudi regime official implicated was Fahad al-Thumairy, a former diplomat in the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles. Al-Thumairy was deported from the U.S. but was never charged with a crime, even after being suspected of supporting two Saudi hijackers who lived in San Diego before the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>\n<p>Lehman said he does not believe the Saudi royal family itself supported the 9/11 attack, but noted the investigation after 9/11 was on the Saudi ministry of Islamic affairs, which sponsored Thumairy in the U.S. and &#8220;has long been suspected of ties to extremist groups,&#8221; the Guardian reported.</p>\n<p>In the interview cited by the newspaper, Lehman said the commissioners&#8217; claims that only one Saudi government employee was \u201cimplicated\u201d is \u201ca game of semantics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey may not have been indicted, but they were certainly implicated,\u201d Lehman said. \u201cThere was an awful lot of circumstantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another commissioner, former Democratic congressman Tim Roemer of Indiana, told the Guardian he wants the 28 pages released, adding, when it comes to the Saudis, \u201cwe still haven\u2019t gotten to the bottom of what happened on 9/11.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another panel member who asked to remain anonymous also called for the declassification, and suggested that the commission did not adequately investigate the alleged involvement of the Saudi regime.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we were tough on the Saudis, but obviously not tough enough,\u201d the commissioner told the Guardian. \u201cI know some members of the staff felt we went much too easy on the Saudis. I didn\u2019t really know the extent of it until after the report came out.\u201d</p>\n<p>The commissioner recalled that investigators said the final report underplayed or ignored evidence that Saudi officials, especially lower-level ones, were part of an al-Qaeda support network.</p>\n<p>Another commissioner, former Nebraska Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey, joined Lehman in filing affidavits in 2015 in support of a lawsuit brought against the Saudi government by the families of Sept. 11 victims.</p>\n<p>\u201cSignificant questions remain unanswered concerning possible involvement of Saudi government institutions and actors,\u201d Kerrey <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2015-02-06/news/58843446_1_cozen-lawyers-cozen-o-connor-saudi-government\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> at the time.</p>\n<p>The 9/11 commission\u2019s right-wing executive director, former Bush official and historian Philip Zelikow, was particularly adamant about resisting the notion that the Saudi regime was involved in the attacks, the Guardian reported.</p>\n<p>Zelikow reportedly fired a staffer who protested limits on the Saudi investigation.

Instead of his latest directorial effort, everyone is talking about the decades-old allegations that he sexually molested his daughter, Dylan Farrow, when she was a little girl.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The timeline goes something like this: The Hollywood Reporter recently ran a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/woody-allen-interview-he-wont-889678\" target=\"_blank\">cover story</a> about Allen in which it not only avoided asking him directly about his daughter&#8217;s allegations against him, but also allowed him to portray his marriage to Soon-Yi Previn\u2014who, lest we forget, was his stepdaughter before becoming his wife\u2014in what can only be described as extremely <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/woody-allen-soon-yi\" target=\"_blank\">questionable</a> terms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was an uproar about THR&#8217;s cowardice, after which the magazine, to its credit, contacted Allen&#8217;s estranged son, Ronan Farrow and asked him to write a reply. Farrow&#8217;s subsequent, explosive <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> criticized THR for its handling of the whole business and demanded that Dylan Farrow&#8217;s allegations be taken seriously. A day later, Allen was finally <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/woody-allen-rape-joke-ronan-farrow-1201772505/\" target=\"_blank\">confronted</a> about the piece while shilling for his new movie at the Cannes Film Festival. He brushed them aside.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This whole fracas says a great deal about both our media culture and our broader entertainment industry. Little of what it reveals is good.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a modicum of positive news to take away from the Allen storm. In an earlier age, THR would likely have been allowed to let its interview with Allen stand as its sole, final word on the subject of his life. Those days are over. The directness of the scrutiny that social media provides means that no publication can pull up the drawbridge anymore. The outcry about the way that THR conducted the interview and ran its story is a sign of progress in and of itself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet: THR did publish that interview. It did run that story on its cover. It did allow Allen to wax on about his marriage in grotesque, unchallenged ways. It did avoid confronting Allen about his daughter&#8217;s allegations against him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">THR should be commended for running Farrow&#8217;s piece, especially given that it contained a direct attack on its editorial judgment. But it is nevertheless pretty extraordinary that the publication had to essentially be guilted into airing Farrow&#8217;s side of the story at all. His sister spoke up publicly <a href=\"http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/\" target=\"_blank\">just two years ago</a>. In the intervening years, the Bill Cosby scandal has provided the world with mountains of direct evidence of the ways in which powerful men are able to silence the women they have harmed\u2014and none of those women were Cosby&#8217;s children. It is astonishing that, given all of this, it took Ronan Farrow&#8217;s public shaming to reintroduce the subject of Allen&#8217;s alleged crimes into the discussion surrounding him. It is equally astonishing that, even after Farrow opened the subject up again, it took the assembled journalists at Cannes <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-woody-allen-cannes-ronan-farrow-20160511-snap-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">another full day</a> to question Allen about what his own son had written about him. Shouldn&#8217;t Dylan Farrow&#8217;s own words have been enough?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After it ran the Farrow op-ed, THR was <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-woody-allen-says-he-893105\" target=\"_blank\">banned</a> from attending an event where Allen was speaking, which should give you a clue about why things unfolded the way that they did. Run a fawning interview that soft-pedals the terrible allegations against Allen? He&#8217;ll grant you a cover story. Question him in any significant way? Find yourself cut off.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am sympathetic to the pressures that journalists face when dealing with aggressive publicists who threaten to torpedo a story if certain questions are raised. These are not easy things to contend with. It&#8217;s also no simple task to ask a legendary figure about highly sensitive portions of his personal life. But sometimes you just have to suck it up and do your job. What good is it to be allowed in a room with Woody Allen if you can only do it in a compromised, grossly tainted way?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The question of whether people should continue watching Woody Allen&#8217;s movies is something that everyone has to answer for themselves. The question of how major stars and production companies can still work with him is another, separate minefield. The question of whether or not the allegations that his own children have leveled against him should occupy a central part of how we think about him\u2014and, crucially, how journalists approach him\u2014is something that requires no such introspection. The charges against Allen should never be allowed to stray from our collective consciousness again. Hopefully The Hollywood Reporter and the rest of the entertainment press will remember that in the future.</p>\n]]><p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/hollywoods_unforgivable_woody_allen_cowardice_what_the_controversy_at_cannes_really_proves/\">Read More...</a></p></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/hollywoods_unforgivable_woody_allen_cowardice_what_the_controversy_at_cannes_really_proves/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Donald Trump could be &#8220;the actual last president of the United States&#8221; says Johnny Depp</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/donald_trump_could_be_the_actual_last_president_of_the_united_states_says_johnny_depp/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/donald_trump_could_be_the_actual_last_president_of_the_united_states_says_johnny_depp/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:19:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Antoaneta Roussi]]></dc:creator>\n\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Social]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[All Salon]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016 presidential elections]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Johnny Depp]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[presidency]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.salon.com/?p=14493353</guid>\n\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Johnny Depp said the U.S. presidency 'won't work' if Donald Trump is elected]]></description>\n\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"620\" height=\"412\" src=\"http://media.salon.com/2015/05/australia-depps-dogs.jpeg1-620x412.jpg\" class=\"attachment-lg_horizontal wp-post-image\" alt=\"Johnny Depp\" />\n<p><em>FILE - In this Jan. 25, 2015 file photo, actor Johnny Depp attends the premiere of the feature film \"Mortdecai\" in Los Angeles.

Every day, colleagues at news organizations forwarded me the emails blasted out by Allen&#8217;s powerful publicist, who had years earlier orchestrated a robust publicity campaign to validate my father&#8217;s sexual relationship with another one of my siblings. Those emails featured talking points ready-made to be converted into stories, complete with validators on offer \u2014 therapists, lawyers, friends, anyone willing to label a young woman confronting a powerful man as crazy, coached, vindictive. At first, they linked to blogs, then to high-profile outlets repeating the talking points \u2014 a self-perpetuating spin machine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote><p>The open CC list on those emails revealed reporters at every major outlet with whom that publicist shared relationships \u2014 and mutual benefit, given her firm&#8217;s starry client list, from Will Smith to Meryl Streep. Reporters on the receiving end of this kind of PR blitz have to wonder if deviating from the talking points might jeopardize their access to all the other A-list clients.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Asked about his son&#8217;s essay, Allen <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/woody-allen-on-ronan-farrow-cannes-rape-joke.html\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly said</a>,<em>\u00a0</em>&#8220;I never read anything about me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Any of these interviews I do, anything.

And heaven knows the Facebook shares number on his piece suggests that there&#8217;s a wide audience\u00a0of liberals who want to hear that\u00a0our main problem is we&#8217;re so smart we mistakenly think others are, too.</p>\n<p>But as pleasurable as it is to hear that people who disagree with you are just idiots, this easy dismissal of the intelligence of millions of people lacks for intellectual rigor, which is deeply unfortunate for someone trying to posit that their problem is they&#8217;re just too smart for the little brains of the world.</p>\n<p>The problem with calling people stupid is that it&#8217;s satisfying, but ultimately meaningless. For one thing, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to measure it.\u00a0It&#8217;s easy to dismiss Trump as a buffoon, but his likely retort to that is hard to argue: He did manage to score the nomination of a major political party and rally millions to his side, which is more than Chait has done with himself.</p>\n<p>The problem is &#8220;intelligence&#8221; is hard to define, and therefore hard to measure. I, for instance, am good at a lot of things that require intelligence: Pithy jokes, analyzing politics, explicating movies and TV shows, Mario Kart, bar trivia. But put me in front of a computer and ask me to program in Python, and I would seem like a screaming moron.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t because I lack in native intelligence, but simply is a measure of where I chose to put my energies.\u00a0That, in turn, is a measure of things that are far more meaningful than this abstract notion of intelligence: My priorities, beliefs, and desires.</p>\n<p>All of which is to say that the reason Chait\u00a0misread Trump voters is not that he overestimated their intelligence, but that he simply didn&#8217;t understand what their beliefs and desires are.</p>\n<p>None of which is to\u00a0<em>defend</em> people who voted for Trump. I have little doubt that most of the are small-minded, petty\u00a0people who take special delight in his racism and misogyny. In fact, if you follow the online communities of Trump supporters, it&#8217;s impossible to conclude anything else. <a href=\"http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2016/05/03/trumplords-celebrate-the-donalds-big-victory-by-yelling-about-cucks-on-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">Many of them delight in calling the opponents &#8220;cucks&#8221;</a>, a gross term derived from racist porn. They are <em>the worst</em>.</p>\n<p>But once you understand their values system, then voting for Trump\u00a0makes perfect sense and isn&#8217;t really stupid at all.\u00a0The main clutch of Trump supporters are white men who openly enjoy the sense of superiority and various social privileges they get from being white men. (Surely Chait can understand that desire to feel superior to huge groups of people.) They like racist jokes and want to believe women were put here as a servant class just for them. They believe in &#8220;English only&#8221; and oppose immigration because it&#8217;s pleasing\u00a0to be automatically privileged by something as arbitrary as where you were born.</p>\n<p>(Female Trump supporters are fewer in number, but\u00a0those that exist are not stupid, either. They just like Trump&#8217;s racism so much that they put up with his misogyny.)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s ugly, but it&#8217;s not particularly opaque. \u00a0These folks wanted to stick it to the Republican establishment they believe isn&#8217;t doing enough to stand up for white and male dominance. Say what you will, but in nominating Trump, they successfully achieved what they set out to do.</p>\n<p>And sure, the Trumpian strain of bigotry does churn out an astonishing array of false beliefs, beliefs that are so contrary to reality that it&#8217;s hard not to wonder if you have to be short a few cards in the deck to believe them, such as the &#8220;birther&#8221; conspiracy theories and\u00a0that Mexican immigrants are all coming here to rape and murder us. These beliefs are false, and it&#8217;s tempting to dismiss them as the hobbyhorses of people who are straight-up stupid.</p>\n<p>But the reality is that holding false but self-serving beliefs is surprisingly common, and intelligence is no prophylactic against it. Liberal enclaves, like the ones that Chait no doubt lives in, are absolutely brimming with smart people who believe false things: That vaccines are dangerous, that it&#8217;s unhealthy to eat GMOs or gluten, that Bernie Sanders still has a chance.</p>\n<p>I doubt anyone would deny that Chait himself is an\u00a0intelligent man, but he just published a lengthy article devoted to a false but self-serving belief that Trump voters are morons.</p>\n<p>Chait also,\u00a0<a href=\"http://the-orbit.net/almostdiamonds/2016/05/11/jonathan-chait-pc-liberal-responsibility-trump/\" target=\"_blank\"> as blogger Stephanie Zvan pointed out</a>, holds a false belief that is quite popular with Trump supporters: That &#8220;free speech&#8221; is under serious threat\u00a0because of the dread &#8220;political correctness&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In Chait\u2019s writing, the urge to protest speaking and writing that treats marginalized groups as less deserving of rights and basic human decency is a powerful force that will stifle free speech, tear our political and educational institutions apart, and concentrate power in the hands of a small group of complainers,&#8221; she notes. It&#8217;s a belief that Chait holds fiercely to, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/punch-drunk-jonathan-chait-takes-on-the-entire-internet-1682078451\" target=\"_blank\">despite a yawning lack of evidence</a> that white dudes holding reactionary views struggle to get their voices heard in 21st century America.</p>\n<p>The mythological beast of &#8220;political correctness&#8221; that keeps Chait living in terror, Zvan argues, &#8220;looks very much like the hideous yoke to which Donald Trump so bravely refuses to bow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Trump\u00a0has openly campaigned on the promise of standing up to &#8220;political correctness&#8221;, airing out all manner of bigoted opinions that used to be kept to whispers out of fear of liberal reaction. It&#8217;s exactly the strike for &#8220;free speech&#8221; that Chait has been demanding, and now he&#8217;s complaining about it.

He&#8217;s right, of course. Hillary Clinton will almost certainly be the next president. I&#8217;ve <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/donald_trump_is_a_legitimate_threat_democrats_must_stop_being_in_denial_about_the_billionaires_popularity/\" target=\"_blank\">argued</a> Trump is a bigger threat than he ought to be, or than reasonable people think he will be, but ultimately he \u2013 and the Republican Party \u2013 have a near-insurmountable Electoral College <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/05/03/republicans_are_facing_an_electoral_disaster_in_november_and_its_not_donald_trumps_fault/\" target=\"_blank\">problem</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, though, this general election will be as ugly as any in recent memory. Trump is a one-trick pony: He&#8217;ll do what he does, namely sling mud and hurl insults. I doubt it will be enough to turn the election,but make no mistake: It will have an impact. The fact is, Clinton is deeply unpopular, as unpopular as any major party candidate we&#8217;ve seen with the lone exception of Trump.</p>\n<p>A Reuters/Ipsos <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKCN0Y21TN\" target=\"_blank\">poll </a>released on Wednesday is a reminder of just how close a Trump-Clinton contest <i>could </i>be. Among likely U.S. voters, Trump&#8217;s numbers are surging. He&#8217;s now virtually tied with Clinton, with 40 percent saying they&#8217;d back Trump and 41 percent saying they&#8217;d back Clinton. Last week Trump trailed Clinton by 13 points in this same poll, an indication of how much Republicans have rallied behind Trump since he became the presumptive nominee.</p>\n<p>To be clear: It&#8217;s still early in the process, and the Democrats have yet to rally behind a candidate. This survey is a soft measure of the political winds at the moment; it&#8217;s nothing to panic over if you&#8217;re a Clinton supporter \u2014 although it is a sign of the\u00a0looming battle.</p>\n<p>Against the backdrop of what will be a nasty general election fight, it&#8217;s intriguing to consider what might have been. We know Joe Biden was close to pulling the trigger and running for president. Were it not for the sudden loss of his son, Beau Biden, he very likely would have.</p>\n<p>Biden&#8217;s popularity is as high as it&#8217;s ever been right now, so it&#8217;s easy to forget how weak a presidential candidate he was in 2008. In this climate, however, Biden may well have cruised to the nomination. Although his record in the senate is spotty at best, he has become decidedly more progressive in recent years. The liberal base of the party would likely have responded better to Biden than they have to Clinton. That a candidate like Bernie Sanders, a relatively unknown self-identified democratic socialist, could push Clinton to the brink is an indicator of how wide open the race really was. At the very least, this was Biden&#8217;s last and best chance to become president.</p>\n<p>Now there are more reasons to speculate about what could have been. According to a Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-223104\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>, if Biden did enter the race, he was sold on Elizabeth Warren as his Vice Presidential nominee:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cBiden, a senior Democratic official said, first mentioned Warren as a possible running mate during his earliest strategy sessions with a team of advisers that included friends Mike Donilon, Steve Richetti and Ted Kaufman&#8230;And Biden broached the idea, almost matter of factly, to Warren during a much-hyped lunch meeting at the vice president&#8217;s residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory last September. Biden, according to a person briefed on details of the meeting, told Warren he wanted her to be his running mater &#8216;during the conversation&#8217; but didn&#8217;t explicitly ask her to commit to the slot or endorse his candidacy.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A Biden-Warren ticket would unquestionably defeat Trump in a landslide. Clinton may do so anyhow, but Biden&#8217;s popularity, particularly among blue-collar Democrats, would remove all doubt. Indeed, assuming Trump was still the GOP nominee, this might have been the most lopsided general election in modern American history with Biden or a comparably popular Democrat at the top of the ticket.</p>\n<p>For her part, Warren has been careful not to make any endorsements. Ideologically aligned with Sanders, progressives hoped Warren would put her stamp on the Vermont senator. But she&#8217;s refused to do so, perhaps because she wants to preserve any leverage she might have when Clinton becomes the nominee. There&#8217;s a vanishingly slim\u00a0chance Clinton may ask Warren to join the ticket at the convention, but that remains <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren-ticket-222652\" target=\"_blank\">highly unlikely</a>.\u00a0Frankly, I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s a wise move for Warren, who could accomplish more in the Senate than she could in the vice president&#8217;s office. And even if Clinton taps Warren as her VP pick, there&#8217;s no reason to suppose that would solve Clinton&#8217;s unfavorability problem.</p>\n<p>In any event, the news that Biden would have chosen Warren as his running mate has to make Democrats wonder how much different the landscape would look had Biden thrown his hat in the ring. Again, Biden is a flawed candidate, but running against Trump and the dumpster fire that is the GOP right now, his path to the White House would be\u00a0wide and unimpeded.</p>\n]]><p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/the_democratic_ticket_that_would_have_been_a_slam_dunk_joe_biden_wanted_elizabeth_warren_as_his_vp/\">Read More...</a></p></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/the_democratic_ticket_that_would_have_been_a_slam_dunk_joe_biden_wanted_elizabeth_warren_as_his_vp/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Paul Krugman goes &#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221; on the GOP nominee and his advisers: &#8220;Truly, Donald Trump, you know nothing&#8221;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/paul_krugman_goes_game_of_thrones_on_the_gop_nominee_and_his_advisers_truly_donald_trump_you_know_nothing/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.salon.com/2016/05/12/paul_krugman_goes_game_of_thrones_on_the_gop_nominee_and_his_advisers_truly_donald_trump_you_know_nothing/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:49:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Eric Kaufman]]></dc:creator>\n\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Business]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[All Salon]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Larry Kudlow]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Paul Krugman]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Stephen Moore]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The New York Times]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[William Kristol]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.salon.com/?p=14493249</guid>\n\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Trump's a know-nothing advised by know-nothings, so it's not a stretch to imagine how little he knows]]></description>\n\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"620\" height=\"412\" src=\"http://media.salon.com/2015/07/paul_krugman6-620x412.jpg\" class=\"attachment-lg_horizontal wp-post-image\" alt=\"Paul Krugman\" />\n<p><em>Paul Krugman       (Credit: AP/Heribert Proepper)</em></p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/send-in-the-clowns/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog%20Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">his New York Times blog</a> Wednesday, Paul Krugman mocked Donald Trump for trying to rectify his ignorance by inviting into the fold two advisers more ignorant than he is &#8212; Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[Y]ou might have thought that he would try to signal his independence from the establishment by, say, turning to some business economist,&#8221; Krugman wrote. &#8220;Instead, he turned to the usual suspects from the right-wing noise machine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kudlow is to economics what William Kristol is to political strategy,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;[I]f he says something, you know it\u2019s wrong.&#8221; After listing the many pronouncements Kudlow&#8217;s made that turned out to be demonstrably wrong, Krugman turned to Moore, &#8220;who has a similarly awesome forecasting record,&#8221; including a monumental misreading of jobs numbers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of course, Moore remains the chief economist at Heritage.
