But <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00117/full\">a new small study</a> suggests that embracing a wide variety of <a href=\"http://time.com/4121973/the-50-new-healthiest-foods-of-all-time-with-recipes/\">healthier behaviors</a> at once, including changes to diet and exercise, may be even more beneficial.</p>\n<p>What the researchers found in a recent study, <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/out-with-the-old/?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fhealth&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=health&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">the New York <em>Times</em> reports</a>, was that people who changed several aspects of their life to be healthier saw bigger improvements in their mood and stress levels compared to people in other trials who changed just one part of their lifestyle. The study was very small, with only about 30 college students. Half of them went about their days as normal, while the other half changed their behaviors significantly, by doing exercises in the morning, including stretching and resistance training, and attending an hour-long session in meditation and stress reduction. A couple times a week they also increased the intensity of their workouts and learned about sleep and nutrition, and they met with instructors to discuss personal challenges and were encouraged to partake in random acts of kindness.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Before they started the interventions, men and women in the study underwent physical and cognitive tests, including graduate comprehension exams, as well as brain scans. A few weeks later they repeated the tests and brain scans and the researchers found that the control group performed the same, but the students with intensive behavior changes were more focus and reported improved happiness and memory.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">&#8220;<span class=\"s1\">Our findings suggest that making multiple lifestyle changes at once can lead to both larger and more numerous benefits than typically observed when focusing on just one thing at a time,&#8221; says study author Michael Mrazek of the University of California Santa Barbara. &#8220;We found parallel and enduring improvements in more than a dozen different outcomes that truly matter in our lives&mdash;strength, endurance, flexibility, focus, reading comprehension, working memory, self-esteem, happiness, and more.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Mrazek says it may be that each lifestyle change supports all the others, and that reinforcing lifestyle changes with other behavior tweaks may make the overall goal more sustainable. &#8220;<span class=\"s1\">Exercising regularly makes it easier to sleep. Sleeping well makes it easier to meditate. Being mindful makes it easier to choose healthy foods,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If you try to force a change like drinking less coffee without also addressing other relevant aspects of your life like sleep, you&#8217;ll likely find that it&#8217;s hard to make the new coffee habit stick.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">But is it possible to sustain so many lifestyle changes? And is it really better to transform all behaviors at one time&mdash;over smaller changes one after the other? Unfortunately those questions still remain. The study is too small to make any definitive conclusions on how to best achieve a healthier life, and some researchers are skeptical of the findings.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;I think that this interpretation is way overblown,&#8221; says Russell A. Poldrack, an </span><span class=\"s1\">Albert Ray Lang Professor of Psychology at </span><span class=\"s1\">Stanford University</span><span class=\"s1\">. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t see how the study tells us anything about different ways to give up bad habits, since it did not compare different interventions, just a single multifaceted intervention versus a very weak control. All it says is that changing lots of things at once can have an effect, but we don&rsquo;t really know where that effect is coming from. In addition, the sample size is far too small for us to make any strong conclusions.&#8221; Poldrack was not involved in the study. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">More research will be needed to best understand the most successful ways to improve health and wellbeing. &#8220;O<span class=\"s1\">ur findings suggest truly remarkable changes are possible if you&#8217;re willing to put in the work,&#8221; says Mrazek.</span></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4327812&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-tomatoes.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-tomatoes.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">healthiest foods, health food, diet, nutrition, time.com stock, tomatoes, fruits</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Why Fears Over Folic Acid and Autism Need to be Properly Understood</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/4327645/folic-acid-autism-pregnancy-b12-folate/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:32:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alexandra Sifferlin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Autism]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[b12]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[folate]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[folic acid]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[folic acid autism]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[folic acid benefits]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Pregnancy]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4327645</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Why folate is still essential for pregnant women<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4327645&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-4327645\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/4327645/folic-acid-autism-pregnancy-b12-folate/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p class=\"p1\">Experts are questioning a study that suggests a link between high levels of folic acid in <a href=\"http://time.com/4250947/pregnancy-timelapse/\">pregnant women</a> and a greater risk for <a href=\"http://time.com/4220366/universal-screening-autism-babies/\">children with autism</a>. Taking the <a href=\"http://time.com/3763271/gnc-supplements-nutrients-food/\">nutrient</a> folate during pregnancy can prevent neural development defects early on, but a recent study suggested that there may be risks to taking too much, suggesting a higher risk for autism if a mother has four times the recommended amount of folate. However, experts, including the study authors, are saying: &#8220;Not so fast.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The study, which was a presentation at an autism research meeting, did not find a causal link between taking folic acid and autism. What the study actually found was pretty specific. The researchers took blood tests of <span class=\"s1\">close to 1,400 </span>mothers between one to three days after they gave birth and found that about 10% of the mothers had very high levels of folate, beyond recommended amounts, and that these women were also more likely to have a baby that would later be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.</p>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">That doesn&#8217;t mean that pregnant women should stop taking folic acid. <a href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/13/study-finds-folic-acid-may-decrease-risk-for-autism/\">Other studies</a> have even suggested it can lower the risk for autism. Folate is critical to maintaining proper growth, and on May 10, the United States Preventative Services Task Force <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Announcements/News/Item/public-comment-on-draft-recommendation-statement-and-draft-evidence-review-folic-acid-supplementation-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects\">released a draft update</a> to its existing recommendations on folic acid, and once again the group is advising all women who are planning or capable of getting pregnant take a daily supplement of 0.4 to 0.8 mg of folic acid.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&ldquo;We have long known that a folate deficiency in pregnant mothers is detrimental to her child&rsquo;s development. But what this tells us is that excessive amounts may also cause harm. We must aim for optimal levels of this important nutrient,&#8221; study</span><span class=\"s1\"> author M. Daniele Fallin, director of the Bloomberg School&rsquo;s Wendy Klag Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities said in a statement. The study findings were presented at the </span><span class=\"s1\">2016 International Meeting for Autism Research in Baltimore.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The authors of the study are also anxious that their study is not misunderstood. &#8220;There&#8217;s this danger that the message would be that folate supplementation is bad. And that&#8217;s not at all what we saw,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/on-folate-and-autism/482307/\">Fallin told the Atlantic</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new study is an early finding and more research is needed. The researchers say more focus should be placed on understanding the optimal dosing for women for the greatest health benefit.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4327645&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rx-prescription-bottle-health-illo.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rx-prescription-bottle-health-illo.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">TIME.com stock health rx prescription bottle drugs</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Entr\u00e9e the Bowl</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/4327436/entree-the-bowl/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov -0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Mandy Oaklander]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Recipes]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4327436</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4327436&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4327436&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/lukas-volger-bowl-cookbook-vegetarian-bibimbap-pho.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=100\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/lukas-volger-bowl-cookbook-vegetarian-bibimbap-pho.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=100\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">lukas-volger-bowl-cookbook-vegetarian-bibimbap-pho</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Abortion Rates Reach Historic Low in Developed Countries</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/4327211/abortion-rates-developing-developed-countries/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:32:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Katie Reilly]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[abortion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Reproductive Health]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4327211</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[But the rate of abortion has stayed consistent in developing countries<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4327211&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-4327211\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/4327211/abortion-rates-developing-developed-countries/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>Abortion rates in developed countries <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30380-4/abstract\">are at a historic low</a>, according to a new report, mostly due to increased use of contraception.

In developing countries, that percentage has declined from 39% between 1990 and 1994 to 28% between 2010 and 2014. In developing countries, that proportion increased from 21% to 32% of pregnancies during the same time periods.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The stability of abortion rates in the developing world raises safety concerns, according to the report.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&ldquo;Estimates of the proportion of abortions that are unsafe are under development but we already know nearly 300 million dollars are spent each year on treating the complications from unsafe abortions,&rdquo; said co-author Bela Ganatra. &ldquo;The high rates of abortion seen in our study also provide further evidence of the need to improve and expand access to effective contraceptive services. Investing in modern contraceptive methods would be far less costly to women and society than having unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The analysis also found that the frequency of abortion appears to be roughly the same in countries with restrictive <a href=\"http://time.com/4244904/women-justices-rally-to-defense-of-abortion-providers-in-supreme-court-oral-arguments/\" target=\"_blank\">abortion laws</a> as it is in countries where the practice is legal. <span class=\"s1\">The abortion rate in countries where abortion is illegal or allowed only to save a woman&rsquo;s life is 37 abortions per 1000 women, while the rate in countries where the practice is legal is 34 abortions per 1000 women.</span></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4327211&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/abortion-report.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/abortion-report.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Pro-Choice Supporters Rally In DC Against Restrictive Abortion Laws</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>What Teen Girls Should Eat to Reduce Breast Cancer Risk</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/4326798/breast-cancer-diet-teen-girls-fruit/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 22:30:02 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Park]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[anti cancer diet]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Breast Cancer]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Cancer]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[diet]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Diet/Nutrition]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[foods that fight cancer]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[preventing cancer]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[teens and cancer]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4326798</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Eating more fruits from a younger age may help ward off cancer <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4326798&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-4326798\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"http://time.com/4326798/breast-cancer-diet-teen-girls-fruit/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>Fruits and vegetables are staples in a healthy diet, and that includes one aimed at preventing cancer. Many studies have documented the lower risk of various cancers among people who eat more fresh produce, and avoid things like red and processed meat.</p>\n<p>But the majority of those studies have focused on adults, and it&rsquo;s becoming clear that many of cancer&rsquo;s drivers start early in life, with genes and even with childhood exposures to potential carcinogens.</p>\n<p>To investigate this further, Maryam Farvid, a research associate at Massachusetts General Hospital and a visiting scientist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and her colleagues decided to study how diet during adolescence might affect cancer risk. In a <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/cgi/doi/10.1136/bmj.i2343\">study reported in the <em>BMJ</em></a>, they plumbed the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study, a massive survey of nurses who filled out questionnaires on their diet and were followed for various health outcomes, including cancer.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n\n<p>About half of the 90,000 women who participated in the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study also answered questions about their typical diet while they were teens. Those who reported eating nearly three servings of fruit a day on average had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who ate half a serving of fruit.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=\"http://time.com/4142592/with-early-breast-cancer-treatment-less-may-be-more-studies/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"item-title\">With Early Breast Cancer Treatment, Less May be More: Studies</span></a></p>\n<p>Certain fruits seemed to confer the biggest protection against breast cancer &mdash; apples, bananas and grapes were associated with the greatest reduction in risk while kale and oranges in adulthood also contributed to reduced breast cancer risk.</p>\n<p>Farvid says that apples, bananas and grapes contain fiber, which could help to lower cancer risk; they are also high in flavonoids, which act as antioxidants to combat damage to cells that can trigger abnormal growth.

In the study, Farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk; that may be because fruit&rsquo;s anti-cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit, which is stripped out of juice. In the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, however, government nutritionists equated servings of whole fruit with fruit juice. &ldquo;We recommend whole fruit and not fruit juice,&rdquo; says Farvid, &ldquo;because maybe one of the most important ways that fruit decreases risk of breast cancer is through fiber, and even natural fruit juice often has no fiber in it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In another <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/cgi/doi/10.1136/bmj.i2314\">study also published in the <em>BMJ</em></a>, a separate group of researchers found that among 22,000 Danish women, those who added two alcoholic drinks a day on average increased their risk of developing breast cancer by 30% over five years. The added risk of cancer, however, was counterbalanced by a lower risk of heart disease.</p>\n<p>Taken together, the results show how critical diet can be in modulating risk of breast cancer. While challenging, changing diet can be a relatively easy way to alter a woman&rsquo;s breast cancer risk equation, beginning even at a young age.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4326798&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-tangerines.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=100\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-tangerines.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=100\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">healthiest foods, health food, diet, nutrition, time.com stock, tangerines, citrus</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>\u2018Club Drug\u2019 Ketamine Provides Hope in Fight Against Depression</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/4326167/depression-ketamine/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 19:19:30 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Addiction]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[antidepressant]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Antidepressants]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Brain]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Depression]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[depression treatments]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[drug addiction]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ketamine]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[mental health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mental Health/Psychology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[psychiatry]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Research]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[treating depression]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4326167</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Ketamine is remarkably good at erasing away the worst symptoms of depression\u2014but there's a catch<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4326167&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-4326167\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"http://time.com/4326167/depression-ketamine/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scientists are increasingly convinced that ketamine, a popular &ldquo;club drug,&rdquo; may be a viable treatment option for people who suffer from depression. The drug could hold particular promise for people who are suicidal, according to the results of one small study.</span></p>\n<p>Depression is so common that people in the U.S. spend about $11 billion each year to relieve their symptoms. Most antidepressants work by adjusting the brain chemicals that can affect our mood, and while some are effective, the drugs are far from perfect. They typically take up to two months to work, and even then, only 30% of people will respond to any given drug. That leaves most people to cycle from one prescription to the next until, hopefully, one starts to lift their feelings of hopelessness and helplessness.</p>\n<p>But beginning in the 1990s, researchers started studying a compound called ketamine that seems to sweep away <a href=\"http://time.com/4193144/depression-screening-adults/\">depressive symptoms</a> with almost miraculous ease and speed. &ldquo;Honestly, it was unlike anything I had ever seen when I first saw its effects four years ago,&rdquo; says Dr. Dawn Ionescu, a staff psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital. &ldquo;We were seeing patients who were depressed for years and tried many different medications, sometimes even electroconvulsive therapy, and nothing worked. But a single infusion improved their depression within hours.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Ketamine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an anesthetic and for treating certain types of pain. In just the right doses, however, it can trigger hallucinatory and out-of-body experiences, which also makes it a popular club drug.</p>\n<p>As more studies are starting to show, ketamine can also be a highly effective way to lift mood. But giving people with depression doses of ketamine could also set them up for addiction; while it rebalances certain brain chemicals pertaining to mood, ketamine also triggers dopamine, a substance with direct links to the reward system. Hits of ketamine make the brain crave even more of the drug, and since depression is a chronic condition that requires consistent treatment, a drug that has the potential to cause dependence is far from ideal.</p>\n<p>Still, two recent papers add stronger evidence to the idea that ketamine could be a new option for treating depression.</p>\n<p>In one study, published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature17998.html\"><em>Nature</em></a>, researchers led by Carlos Zarate from the National Institute of Mental Health used animals to figure out how ketamine works in the brain and how it affects depression. They studied ketamine, as well as the byproducts it releases after it&rsquo;s broken down by the body, to understand how the drug affects depression. They found that ketamine leads to the side effects of dependence and dissociative thinking by blocking a brain pathway called NMDA, which affects mood. But they also made an important discovery about one of ketamine&rsquo;s byproducts&mdash;one metabolite in particular&mdash;which remain in the body for days after the drug is taken. This metabolite appears to trigger the antidepressant effects of ketamine, but without the side effects and addictive potential.</p>\n<p>That explains why previous studies found that ketamine&rsquo;s ability to relieve depression occurred so quickly and lasted for days, often up to a week. Zarate is particularly encouraged by the fact that the metabolite he found doesn&rsquo;t seem to activate the pathway that&rsquo;s responsible for ketamine&rsquo;s addictive effects as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"http://time.com/4030506/fish-omega3-depression/\"><span class=\"item-title\">Eating Fish May Lower Your Risk for Depression</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"2\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4879654090001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://ti.me/1WpFM28\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4879654090001\"></object></div></div><div class=\"clearvideofloat\"></div></p>\n<p>That means that if drug developers can find a way to mimic the metabolite, and provide it in just the right dose, ketamine could become an appealing treatment. Theoretically, it could even be used early in a person&rsquo;s depression history, and, because it acts quickly, might save millions of people from unnecessary suffering.</p>\n<p>That may be especially true of people with severe depression who also experience suicidal thoughts. In a small separate <a href=\"http://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2016/aheadofprint/15m10056.aspx\">study</a>, published this year in the <a href=\"http://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2016/aheadofprint/15m10056.aspx\"><em>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</em></a>, Ionescu found that among 14 people with depression and suicidal thoughts, a few infusions of ketamine helped them to lessen their suicidal ideations considerably after three weeks. While there is still debate over whether suicidal thoughts are part of depression or in a separate category, having a compound that could address them is critical. &ldquo;Suicide is the only top 10 cause of death that is <a href=\"http://time.com/4304621/suicide-rate-cdc-women/\">increasing</a>, not decreasing,&rdquo; says Dr. Charles Nemeroff, chairman of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami and chair of the American Psychiatric Association task force on biomarkers and novel treatments. &ldquo;Most of that is due to untreated, under-treated or treatment-resistant depression.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We definitely need to understand the addictive potential and side effects of ketamine more before it becomes a prime time treatment for depression,&rdquo; says Ionescu. &ldquo;But what we&rsquo;re excited about is the fact that we may have something that is helping very sick patients in a relatively short period of time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nemeroff is equally encouraged by the findings, but warns that the number of patients studied in ketamine trials is still small, and the sample may not be representative of all people with depression. Most of the people currently in ketamine trials are there as a last resort; they&#8217;ve failed other antidepressant therapies, including numerous medications and electroconvulsive therapy.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s also concerned about the growing number of ketamine clinics that are popping up around the country, where people with depression can receive infusions of ketamine via IV. Some of those clinics aren&rsquo;t run by psychiatrists or mental health professionals, he says, but by anesthesiologists and pain physicians who may not have as refined training about how best to use ketamine for depression. &ldquo;I worry about how well people are screened, and because this is a drug of abuse, whether people are screened for drug abuse as well,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p>Even though doctors can prescribe ketamine for depression off label, huge questions still remain about how much of the drug to give, and for how long, says Nemeroff. There is also no data on the safety or efficacy of using ketamine long-term. &ldquo;If we give ketamine to someone who is suicidal, and they&rsquo;re no longer suicidal, do we let them go? What happens the next day or two days later? Does the suicidality come back? These are the kinds of questions we need to know the answer to,&rdquo; says Nemeroff.</p>\n<p>Some of those answers may come from a trial that Johnson &amp; Johnson is conducting on a type of ketamine they&rsquo;ve developed as an intranasal medication. That study will provide more data on what dose might help people with depression, how long the drug should be given and whether there are long-term side effects. If those results are positive, then groups like the American Psychological Association will need to help doctors decide who might benefit most from the drug by coming up with guidelines for how best to administer the medication. &ldquo;It would be terrific to have new targets to treat depression,&rdquo; says Nemeroff. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying that I want us to be cautious.&rdquo;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4326167&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-548327743.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-548327743.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">548327743</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Scientists Get Closer to Understanding How Zika Causes Birth Defects</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/4326686/zika-birth-defects-study-pregnancy/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 19:09:39 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alexandra Sifferlin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[birth defects]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[microcephaly]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Zika]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Zika symptoms]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Zika virus]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4326686</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Three new studies look at how the virus behaves in mice<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4326686&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-4326686\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/4326686/zika-birth-defects-study-pregnancy/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>Health officials have said for some time now that they are <a href=\"http://time.com/4292697/zika-birth-defects-microcephaly/\">confident that Zika causes the birth defect microcephaly</a>.

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found that the Zika virus enters a pregnant mouse&#8217;s bloodstream and reaches the placenta where it multiplies. It then spreads to the fetuses and infects the brain cells of the mouse&#8217;s fetuses.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vnfv/ncurrent/full/nature18296.html\">another study</a> published in the journal <em>Nature</em>, researchers infected mice with Zika and found that the virus infected the fetuses and restricted growth. They also observed signs of microcephaly in the mice. In a <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(16)30084-4\">third study</a> published in the jounal <em>Cell Stem Cell</em>, researchers infected a mouse fetus and observed rapid virus multiplication and brain development issues similar to those seen in microcephaly, the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-zika-birth-defects-20160510-story.html\">Los Angeles <em>Times</em> reports</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p>Mouse models do not directly translate to humans and cannot offer definitive conclusions about how the virus reacts in a pregnant woman. Still, a mouse model is considered the first step in understanding this process and can help inform vaccine and drug development. Simultaneously, <a href=\"http://time.com/4209537/zika-birth-defects/\">researchers are also studying</a> pregnant women and families of infants born with microcephaly to understand more about the virus and some of the risk factors for infection and birth defect development.

It turns out that mental work can deplete people of energy, causing their bodies to crave a re-boot&mdash;often in the form of <a href=\"http://time.com/4322930/how-junk-food-wrecks-your-body/\">food</a>. However, a small <a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Exercise_Following_Mental_Work_Prevented.97536.aspx\">new study</a> reveals that a good way to combat the office munchies is<a href=\"http://time.com/4019563/exercise-work-desk/\"> exercise</a>.</p>\n<p>It may seem counterintuitive, but <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18725427\">emerging research</a> is suggesting that exercise actually makes people feel less hungry, possibly due to better regulation of the hormones associated with hunger. In a recent <a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Exercise_Following_Mental_Work_Prevented.97536.aspx\">study</a>, published in the journal <em>Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise</em>, researchers found that people who exercised after doing mental work&mdash;like the work we all do at the office each day&mdash;ate fewer calories compared to people who did mental work and then remained sedentary.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p>In the study, researchers randomly assigned 38 college students to either complete a graduate entrance level exam and then spend 15 minutes resting, or complete the exam and spend 15 minutes doing <a href=\"http://time.com/4098207/interval-training-hiit/?iid=sr-link1\">high intensity interval training</a> (HIIT) on a treadmill. The men and women also separately spent 35 minutes relaxing as a control condition. Afterwards, the men and women in the study were told they could eat as much pizza as they wanted.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=\"http://time.com/4311373/interval-training-benefits/?iid=sr-link1\">The Case For the One-Minute Workout Is Getting Stronger</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The researchers found that the people who did mental work and rested ate an average of 100 calories more than when they simply relaxed, suggesting that working our brains expends energy and makes us hungry. Conversely, the people that exercised after mental work didn&#8217;t eat more calories, even though they used more energy working out. &#8220;Exercise has the ability to increase available fuel sources in the body that may signal to the brain: &#8216;Here is the energy source I need, I don&rsquo;t need to replenish it through food,'&#8221; says study author William H.

That could explain why people often don&#8217;t want to eat immediately after exercise, he says: exercise might be enough of a reward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s the distraction that buffers the desire for food,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I think this will be highly applicable to a number of individuals who perform sedentary tasks that are mentally demanding but not physically demanding.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The study sample is very small, but it&#8217;s not the first to look at the connection between work and eating more food. Similar studies will need to be done to determine how great a role exercise plays in keeping appetite in check, as well as how much exercise is needed to curb hunger.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4325142&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/health-weight-exercise-3.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/health-weight-exercise-3.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">TIME.com stock photos Weight Loss Health Exercise Weights</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Zika Virus: What Symptoms Should You Look Out For?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/4322775/zika-symptoms-mosquito-virus/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 14:39:21 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alexandra Sifferlin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[symptoms of Zika]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[virus Zika]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Zika]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Zika symptoms]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Zika virus]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4322775</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Zika can feel like other common ailments\u2014if you get symptoms at all<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4322775&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-4322775\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/4322775/zika-symptoms-mosquito-virus/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>Mosquito season is just around the corner, which means the U.S. and other countries are <a href=\"http://time.com/4304851/how-the-united-states-is-bracing-for-zika/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter\">ramping up mosquito control</a> in an attempt to contain the rapidly spreading <a href=\"http://time.com/4318624/zika-virus-and-birth-defects-what-you-need-to-know/\">Zika virus</a>.</p>\n<p>But as <a href=\"http://time.com/4319115/what-you-need-to-know-about-zika/?xid=homepage&amp;pcd=hp-magmod\">TIME recently reported in our cover story</a>, authorities still expect the U.S. to see some locally transmitted cases of the virus this summer. One challenge is that it can be difficult to track the exact number of people infected with Zika, because the symptoms are similar to other diseases&mdash;and the vast majority of those who are infected don&#8217;t show any symptoms at all.</p>\n<p>For those who do develop symptoms, the most common ones that characterize a Zika infection are red eyes, joint pain, rash and fever. If a person has a rash with or without a fever and another one of the four symptoms, that is considered a probable case of Zika. Still, there are other ailments that can cause similar symptoms, like the flu or other mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p>Right now, the people at risk of getting infected are those who travel to one of the over 40 countries with ongoing Zika virus transmission. Should a person start having symptoms of the virus within two weeks of traveling to an affected region, it may be a good idea to see a doctor and determine whether to be tested. All pregnant women who travel to regions with Zika should be tested regardless of whether they have symptoms, health experts advise. Pregnant women are especially vulnerable since Zika is now proven to cause microcephaly, a birth defect, in infants. Partners of pregnant women should also be aware that the virus can be sexually transmitted, which is why health officials are advising men to abstain or use contraception for six months if they have been exposed and don&#8217;t want to pass it on. Women who may have been exposed should wait at least eight weeks before trying to get pregnant.</p>\n<p>Currently, only state and federal laboratories can test for the virus and sometimes results can take weeks to get back.
