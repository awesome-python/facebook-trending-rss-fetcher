Wherever he goes, people tell him he\u2019s visiting the region\u2019s equivalent of Silicon Valley: \u201cOur community is the Silicon Valley of the Left Bank of Paris, our community is the Silicon Valley of Tel Aviv.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKitchener-Waterloo and the Toronto area really are a Silicon Valley, second only maybe to the actual Silicon Valley. A place that celebrates the idea that failure is something to be, if not encouraged, at least accepted,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a word for failure. It&#8217;s called experience. The only way to make these innovations in the world is to accept these frustrations and setbacks.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/silicon-valleys-singularity-university-calls-on-canadian-innovators\">Silicon Valley\u2019s Singularity University calls on Canadian innovators</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/business-insider/how-to-live-forever-tech-that-will-keep-you-young-and-beautiful\">How to live forever: Tech that will keep you young and beautiful</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/business-insider/11-hilariously-wrong-predictions-about-the-internet\">11 hilariously wrong predictions about the Internet</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>Waterloo\u2019s major frustration and setback, of course, would be BlackBerry Ltd.\u2019s decline. Once one of the world&#8217;s leading handset makers, it has gone from selling more than 12 million handsets each quarter to about 700,000, after it was dethroned by Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone.</p>\n<p>But if Kurzweil is right, we shouldn\u2019t worry too much about such things, since new technological wonders \u2014 including indefinitely prolonged life \u2014 are much closer than most people think.</p>\n<p>Kurzweil has a long and colourful resume. He invented the flatbed scanner, the text-to-speech machine and the musical synthesizer, making the first one capable of reproducing the sounds of musical instruments like the grand piano.</p>\n<p>Lately, he&nbsp;is best known as a public intellectual, writing best-selling books such as The Singularity is Near and How to Create a Mind that make predictions about advances in artificial intelligence and human health. He has made accurate predictions on topics ranging from growth in Internet usage and wireless communications, pegging his accuracy rate at 86 per cent (a figure disputed by critics).</p>\n<p>That track record makes people more willing to listen to the predictions he\u2019s making now, many of which sound more like the plot of a science fiction movie than reality.</p>\n<p>Kurzweil believes that two decades from now, our bloodstreams will be filled with robots the size of blood cells fighting diseases and improving our cognitive functions, allowing humans to radically extend their life spans.</p>\n<p>By 2029, he predicts humans will be unable to tell if they are conversing with a machine or another human, known as the Turing test for artificial intelligence. Fifteen years beyond that, he says&nbsp;humans will merge their intelligence with machines in an event known as the singularity.</p>\n<p>Google, for one, is listening to what he has to say, putting him in charge of a team working on machine intelligence and natural language understanding. Kurzweil said the difference between himself and his critics \u2014 and one of the main reasons predictions about technological progress usually turn out to be completely wrong \u2014 is that he works on the assumption the pace of change will be exponential, not linear.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis trickle of applications now coming into practice will be a flood over the next decade,\u201d Kurzweil said. \u201cThese technologies will be another 1,000 times more powerful in 10 years, one million times more powerful in 20 years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kurzweil said investors are often frustrated when hyped technology, from e-commerce during the dot-com bubble of the early \u201800s to three dimensional printing today, takes longer to catch on than people hoped. That\u2019s because exponential growth curves start off slowly before taking off at huge rates of change.</p>\n<p>When that happens, both technology and the value of companies that own and develop it grow at rapid paces, he said. Kurzweil cited Google and Apple, now the world\u2019s two biggest companies by market capitalization, as examples.</p>\n<p>Kurzweil pulled a smartphone out of his pocket to make his point.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is several billion times more powerful in terms of computation and communication than the computer I used when I went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he said. \u201cI actually went to MIT because it was so advanced at the time, it actually had a computer.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Financial Post</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:cbrownell@nationalpost.com\"><em>cbrownell@nationalpost.com</em></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://Twitter.com/clabrow\"><em>Twitter.com/clabrow</em></a></p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/google-incs-ai-guru-ray-kurzweil-talks-failure-nano-robots-and-the-singularity-in-waterloo/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/0512kurzweil.jpg?w=620\" title=\"0512kurzweil\" Abstract=\"Futurist, inventor and Google director of engineering Ray Kurzweil thinks Kitchener-Waterloo and Toronto &quot;really are a Silicon Valley, second only maybe to the actual Silicon Valley.&quot;\" Credit=\"Peter Power for National Post\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/0512kurzweil.jpg?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/0512kurzweil.jpg?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">0512kurzweil</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Apple shares fall below US$90 for the first time since 2014 as iPhone concerns fester</title>\n\t\t<link>http://business.financialpost.com/investing/trading-desk/apple-shares-falls-below-us90-for-the-first-time-since-2014-as-iphone-worries-fester</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://business.financialpost.com/investing/trading-desk/apple-shares-falls-below-us90-for-the-first-time-since-2014-as-iphone-worries-fester#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:32:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Reuters]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Trading Desk]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FP Tech Desk]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Alphabet Inc.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Apple Inc.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Apple iPhone]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://financialpostcom.wordpress.com?p=659301&#038;preview_id=659301</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[In the past year, Apple's market capitalization has fallen by more than US$200 billion \u2014 roughly the size of Verizon Communications or Wal-Mart Stores]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Shares of Apple dropped below US$90 on Thursday for the first time since 2014 as Wall Street worried about slow demand ahead of the anticipated launch of a new iPhone later this year.</p>\n<p>A mainstay of many Wall Street portfolios, Apple fell to as low as US$89.47 before recovering slightly to US$90.13, a 2.55 per cent loss.</p>\n<p>Component suppliers in Taiwan will receive fewer orders from Apple in the second half of 2016 than in the same period last year, the Nikkei Asia Review reported on Thursday, citing sources.

version of Bungie&#8217;s blockbuster online shooter \u2013 especially in its story mode, which is composed of just a handful of linear missions designed to be tackled cooperatively by small groups of players, with loot collection playing a small but ultimately&nbsp;important role.</p>\n<p>And if you happen to be a big fan of MOBAs then you&#8217;re sure to find familiar elements of those games, both in the diverse selection of heroes you get to choose from before each match and in the competitive multiplayer modes, which see&nbsp;teams dealing with enemy minions and turrets while trying to achieve specific objectives as a group.</p>\n<p>But even if you happen to be a fan of one or all of these games, there&#8217;s a pretty good chance you&#8217;ll find <em>Battleborn</em> \u2013 at least in its current state \u2013 to be a bit of a mess. A sometimes fun, often intense, and even subtly addictive mess, but a mess all the same.</p>\n<div class=\"npImgCentre\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-657955\" alt=\"2K Games\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/battleborn-2.jpg?w=620&#038;h=349\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">2K Games</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Don&#8217;t even ask me what the story is about. After more than a dozen hours of play I still don&#8217;t understand much beyond the simple premise that opposing factions are at war in what remains of a severely contracted universe. Off-screen allies provide context for objectives in each mission over the radio, but I was left thoroughly baffled as to the details of the conflict. It makes <em>Destiny</em>&#8216;s day one narrative look like <em>War and Peace</em>.</p>\n<p>The campaign is spread over a series of half-hour missions that can technically be played alone, though doing so will likely double their length and render what little dialogue exists a bit confusing, since allies tend to speak to you as though you&#8217;re part of a group. Basically, you should either call some friends, hook up with strangers in matchmaking (which is pretty reliable), or opt not to play the story missions at all.</p>\n<p>That said, if you don&#8217;t waste any brain cells trying to decipher the disjointed story and choose to play as part of a group you could be in for some fun.</p>\n<p>Level design borders on monotonous (lots of geometric platforms, stairs, and structures that make Halo&#8217;s alien worlds seem downright homey), but some of the missions still manage to feel pleasantly distinct. A&nbsp;few include cleverly designed tower defense-style scenarios in which an area needs to be defended against waves of enemies using turrets, traps, and drones. Plus,&nbsp;many of the boss battles evolve in stages and require both&nbsp;stamina and strategy. They&#8217;re&nbsp;best tackled&nbsp;with at least a modicum of teamwork.</p>\n<p>Most of the missions are pretty easy, though. I&#8217;ve only been defeated in&nbsp;one so far, and that was because three of our five party members dropped out at the outset.</p>\n<p>Not that I blame anyone for abandoning a mission. In fact, I&#8217;m surprised it hasn&#8217;t happened to me more often \u2013 especially since you can&#8217;t choose the specific mission you want to play but must instead rely on a voting system. Worse, you can&#8217;t exit the match between the time voting commences and the start of the mission to allow someone else to join in.</p>\n<p>I once quit out of <em>Battleborn</em>&nbsp;entirely after the people&nbsp;I was playing with voted for a mission I&#8217;d just completed twice in a row. It was the only way I could think to avoid sitting&nbsp;through the sometimes minutes-long map loading, mission intro, and character selection process.</p>\n<div class=\"npImgCentre\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-657956\" alt=\"2K Games\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/battleborn-3.jpg?w=620&#038;h=349\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">2K Games</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>On the subject of characters, they&#8217;re easily the best part of <em>Battleborn</em>. There are more than two dozen of them at launch (with more to come via DLC), and while I&#8217;ve only unlocked about half so far each one has been unique from the rest in his or her appearance, personality, and abilities.</p>\n<p>Some are melee fighters, some are medium or long range combatants. Some use weapons that require frequent reloading, others allow you to never take your finger off the trigger. Some can generate shields, some can stun enemies, some can summon pillars of magical energy. And at each of the ten levels they gain during every mission or match you can choose between a pair of perks and augmentations \u2013 wider blast radii, higher jumps, prolonged ability effects \u2013 that make them even more powerful.</p>\n<p>You will find favourites. I enjoy playing as the bow-wielding Thorn (one of the few&nbsp;characters that lets you zoom in on targets), a four-armed witch named Orendi who spews balls of black magic from each of her hands and has some great one-liners, and Rath, who is brilliant at close-quarters combat thanks to his slashing and spinning energy blade attacks.</p>\n<p>But while favourites are to be expected, it seems at this early stage that some of the more competitive players have become perhaps a little too comfortable with the characters they like best. I&#8217;ve played several matches in which my team has literally had only one or two kills. In one particularly lopsided match my side failed to take down a single enemy player while one seemingly preternaturally gifted guy on the other team racked up 27 kills.</p>\n<p>These kinds of balancing problems are to be expected in a game with such a huge assortment of playable characters each with distinct attacks and abilities. And I suspect that the bigger issues will be balanced out with patches over time. For now, though, expect to engage in some seriously uneven battles that just won&#8217;t be much fun.</p>\n<div class=\"npImgCentre\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-657959\" alt=\"2K Games\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/battleborn-6.jpg?w=620&#038;h=349\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">2K Games</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>For the moment, the smart play may be simply to wait and see how things shake out between now and the first one or two (of a scheduled five) paid DLC drops. Other than a healthy variety of characters, there&#8217;s not much to it&nbsp;at the moment. Just a handful of missions, multiplayer maps, and modes.</p>\n<p>Gearbox attempts to make up for this with long-term challenges and rewards, including both new characters and powerful gear that can be assigned to custom loadouts and then activated mid-match once you have enough money. This might&nbsp;keep some people hooked. But working through the same arenas and modes time and again is likely to get a bit boring for all but the most hardcore and competitive of players.</p>\n<p><em>Battleborn</em> has laid the groundwork for a decent online cooperative and competitive shooter, but most players would do will to hold off until it rectifies its balancing issues and dearth of content.</p>\n<div class=\"npImgCentre\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-657957\" alt=\"2K Games\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/battleborn-4.jpg?w=620&#038;h=349\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">2K Games</span></div></div></div></div>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/post-arcade/battleborn-review-borderlands-destiny-moba-but-less-than-the-sum-of-its-parts/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/battleborn-5.jpg?w=620\" title=\"Battleborn 5\" Abstract=\"If Battleborn looks a bit like Borderlands that&#039;s probably because both games were made by the same studio.

A bill that prevents companies of 50 or more employees from sending emails after typical work hours passed the French lower parliamentary house earlier this week.</p>\n<p>The case against after-work emails is that they can cause high levels of stress among employees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All the studies show there is far more work-related stress today than there used to be and that the stress is constant,&#8221; said Benoit Hamon, a Socialist member of Parliament, to the BBC. &#8220;The texts, the messages, the emails &#8212; they colonize the life of the individual to the point where he or she eventually breaks down.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/executive/how-employers-can-stop-losing-productivity-to-smoke-breaks-working-from-home-and-stress-leave\">How employers can stop losing productivity to smoke breaks, working from home and stress leave</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/executive/careers/making-the-decision-to-disclose-and-discuss-disabilities-in-the-workplace\">Making the decision to disclose and discuss disabilities in the workplace</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the first time a bill of this nature has been proposed. It&#8217;s similar to legislation that was introduced but never made it to the books in both France and Germany. France&#8217;s most recent bill, however, is the closest an after-work email ban has come to becoming an actual law.</p>\n<p>Gillian Symon, who studies the way modern people switch between the digital and corporate world, applauds the legislation for placing the responsibility of balancing work and life on the bosses rather than the employees. She said that her research with Digital Brain Switch, an interdisciplinary project that combines research from several UK universities, has found that the implications of putting the onus of answering work emails on employees can have devastating emotional effects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was much guilt, as you might expect as people felt concerned about whether they should ignore work or their family, again putting all the responsibility for the &#8216;choice&#8217; on employees,&#8221; she told The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>But both Symon and Jon Whittle, another researcher at Digital Brain Trust, fear that the law does not get to the root of the issue. It sometimes can be more stressful, they say, for an employee to power down their device because of the slew of emails that could be waiting for them in the morning. &#8220;I think the topic of work-related well-being is much larger than simply stopping email after-hours,&#8221; said Whittle. &#8220;Email is just a medium used to communicate. The real problem is the culture of having to constantly do more and constantly do better than competitors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This fear of being left behind by the competition is expressed by some workers. &#8220;In my company, we compete with Indian, Chinese, American developers. We need to talk to people around the world late into the night,&#8221; a software coder named Gregory told the BBC. &#8220;Our competitors don&#8217;t have the same restrictions. If we obeyed this law we would just be shooting ourselves in the foot.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>The topic of work-related well-being is much larger than simply stopping email after-hours</p></blockquote>\n<p>But Whittle of Digital Brain Trust is quick to point out that a workplace that prioritizes well-being among workers promotes better work. &#8220;Having a happy and stress-free workforce can provide a competitive advantage,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The culture of expecting people to be always connected and always on will not necessarily lead to a competitive advantage; it could just lead to burnout and losing top-performing staff.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The bill will journey to the Senate next, where it will be reviewed, before going back to the National Assembly for final passage. It&#8217;s been highly contested since its introduction, specifically for its legislative rollbacks to the country&#8217;s prized labor code that protects employee rights.

Job postings and recent updates to Tango&#8217;s developer software show steps toward this ambitious goal. Google will showcase progress at its I/O developer conference near its Silicon Valley headquarters May 18 to 20.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/google-to-ban-payday-lending-ads-says-industry-is-harmful-and-deceptive\">Google to ban payday lending ads, says industry is \u2018harmful\u2019 and \u2018deceptive\u2019</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/personal-tech/google-begins-selling-google-cardboard-its-20-virtual-reality-viewer-in-canada\">Google begins selling Google Cardboard, its $20 \u2018virtual reality viewer,\u2019 in Canada</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>Tango packs&nbsp;cameras and depth sensors along with other software into Android smartphones and tablets. Fire up the application and point the device at a space and it sucks in images and depth information to re-create the environment on the screen and locates itself within that new digital realm.</p>\n<p>Google hopes Tango will support a system for independent developers to create new virtual reality applications and services. Video games could have characters that hide behind real-life furniture. A museum app could show 3D animations when you walk past an exhibit. A grocery store could highlight sale items and guide shoppers to the right shelf.</p>\n<p>Unlike most emerging virtual reality systems, Tango doesn&#8217;t need external equipment to re-create the world digitally. And unlike Google Maps it can figure out the details of a space without additional data sources.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tango is the indoor extension of their outdoor mapping platform,&#8221; said Lex Dreitser, a virtual reality developer who builds Tango applications.</p>\n<h3>&#8216;Goose bumps&#8217;</h3>\n<p>Tango started in a Google research lab more than two years ago, but the company is trying to take it mainstream this year. It&#8217;s going into new smartphones from Intel Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd. and the software has been updated to let it easily run on more devices.&nbsp;And there are signs Google is working on the most important challenge: Making Tango 3D maps shareable so the company can someday patch them together into a single, detailed digital representation of many of the world&#8217;s buildings, rooms and the stuff inside them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Google Maps is one of Google&#8217;s most successful services, used by more than a billion people every month. It&#8217;s stitched into other popular Google services, like Gmail, Calendar and Photos. With more detailed maps, Google could build new advertising and location-based services into its products. It could also offer these capabilities to outside developers, letting them create more powerful applications for its Android operating system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If Tango could digitize every single physical commerce place, then all of a sudden Google has an exponential opportunity to place very relevant contextual physical advertising in every space,&#8221; said Nathan Pettyjohn, Chief Executive Officer of Aisle411, a mobile commerce and location company that has built applications for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Toys R Us Inc. &#8220;It literally gives me goose bumps talking about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tango could also make Google a potent virtual reality rival to Facebook Inc.&#8217;s Oculus and HTC Corp.&#8217;s Vive. The Vive and the Oculus need separate sensors along with their headsets to map a room, while Tango does it with components in the phone or tablet. The closest competitor may be Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s HoloLens, a headset that integrates the technology. Occipital, a startup, makes a device that can be attached to standard Apple Inc. iOS and Android devices to give them 3D sensing capabilities. Apple may be working on VR and 3D sensing too through PrimeSense, a company it acquired in 2013.</p>\n<p>Gina Scigliano, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>In January,&nbsp;Google software engineer Eitan Marder-Eppstein said the technology had &#8220;a lot of potential for indoor navigation.&#8221; And back in 2014, another Google engineer, Simon Lynen, said the company was researching how to use multiple Tango devices to build large, detailed maps that could be combined and downloaded to devices giving them &#8220;a human-scale understanding of space and motion.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Tango&#8217;s cloud</h3>\n<p>The company is hosting four I/O sessions on Tango this year, up from one in 2015.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With I/O it feels like they&#8217;re really doubling down on it,&#8221; said Andrew Nakas, who has been building Tango applications for two years. &#8220;I can do things now I had no expectation I could do back then in 2014.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kris Kitchen, an inventor, built an application for the blind using Tango and a backpack-sized speaker called a SubPac. Tango maps a space and passes that data to the SubPac, which vibrates differently according to the proximity of objects. That gives blind people an additional sense &#8212; touch &#8212; alongside hearing to get around.</p>\n<p>For Tango applications like this to reach the most people, 3D data will need to be easily shareable among devices. That would mean one person could map a museum, and another person could build an application based on the original map, or extend it, saving effort.</p>\n<p>Google is working on this by building a system that allows Tango devices to share maps with other devices. It may also weave all these maps together and store the information in its data centers so it can be accessed by even more devices.</p>\n<p>Tango will &#8220;rely on cloud infrastructure to store, merge, and serve location data to specific Project Tango devices,&#8221; Google wrote in a job posting in February for a mobile software engineer to work on the project. The company asked for &#8220;experience with Google Maps and other related location products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A cloud service would make life easier for developers, according to Pettyjohn. &#8220;Right now you have to save these mapping files on the device,&#8221; he said. A cloud service would make it so &#8220;anytime you need it, you pull down a file on the spot.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/\"><em>Bloomberg News</em></a></p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/alphabet-incs-google-wants-to-move-past-maps-and-digitally-create-the-interior-world-in-3d/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/google_maps.png?w=620\" title=\"GOOGLE_MAPS\" Abstract=\"Google wants to digitally map the interiors of buildings in 3D down to a resolution of a few inches.\" Credit=\"Tony Avelar/Bloomberg\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/google_maps.png?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/google_maps.png?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">GOOGLE_MAPS</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Colourful and flat: Facebook gives Instagram its first new logo, redesigns app layout</title>\n\t\t<link>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/personal-tech/colourful-and-flat-facebook-gives-instagram-its-first-new-logo-redesigns-app-layout</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/personal-tech/colourful-and-flat-facebook-gives-instagram-its-first-new-logo-redesigns-app-layout#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 20:36:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh McConnell]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Personal Tech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Apps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Inc.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Instagram]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://business.financialpost.com/?p=658679</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The black-and-white app design that leaked prior to today makes the unveiling of a colourful new logo a bit surprising, however the contrast seems to be a calculated]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>For the first time since Instagram debuted in October 2010, Instagram is getting a new logo.</p>\n<p>Gone is the old-fashioned camera, which was rich in&nbsp;texture but dated in look.

Bell, which has only filed five such petitions in two decades, argued the CRTC decision would most hurt rural communities without sufficient returns to justify building fibre infrastructure.</p>\n<p>But the Liberal government sided with the CRTC \u2014 and nearly 80,000 people who signed OpenMedia\u2019s online petition asking the feds to \u201creject Bell\u2019s price-gauging scheme\u201d \u2014 citing the need for accessible, reliable and affordable high-speed Internet for middle-class and low-income families.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are committed to increasing higher-speed broadband coverage and supporting competition, choice and availability of services for Canadian consumers and business users,\u201d Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Navdeep Bains said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Independent providers were grateful for the Liberals\u2019 response to Bell\u2019s petition, which Burger called a \u201cgrave, existential threat\u201d to the market due to its potential to exclude small players from serving high-use Internet users. (Bell\u2019s fibre cables allow top download speeds of up to 940 megabits per second compared to VMedia\u2019s top speeds of 250 megabits per second.

The final wholesale rate \u2014 it will likely take at least a year to set \u2014 will be the critical determinant of whether small players can offer cheaper prices, Abramson said.</p>\n<p>Bell will abide by the rules and move forward, spokesman Murray MacDonald said in an email.

The industry will join Google&#8217;s other banned categories of ads, such as counterfeit goods, weapons, explosives, tobacco products and hate speech.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/google-acquires-toronto-based-synergyse-to-offer-interactive-tutorials-for-google-apps\">Google acquires Toronto-based Synergyse to offer interactive tutorials for Google Apps</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/google-planning-unplugged-online-subscription-tv-service-for-youtube-next-year-sources\">Google planning \u2018Unplugged\u2019 online subscription TV service for YouTube next year: sources</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>&#8220;Our hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products,&#8221; said David Graff, Google&#8217;s director of global product policy, in a blog post that announced the policy change.</p>\n<p>Payday lenders have long been a target of criticism by politicians and consumer advocates, who argue the industry charges extremely high interest rates to customers, who are often the poor. Payday loans are often used to cover an unexpected expense or to make ends meet before the next paycheque. But for many borrowers, short-term loans wind up being difficult to pay off, leading to a cycle of debt that can drag on for months.</p>\n<p>A 2012 study by Pew showed the average payday borrower is in debt for five months, spending $520 in fees and interest to repeatedly borrow $375. The annual per cent rate on a payday loan is 391 per cent, according to Pew.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is nothing fair about triple-digit interest rates being charged on loans to working families,&#8221; said Keith Corbett, executive vice-president with the Center for Responsible Lending, in a statement. Payday loan stores reap billions of dollars in interest and fees on a product designed to force borrowers into repeat loans. Google is to be praised for doing its part to limit use of these abusive loans.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In response to critics, the payday lending industry has long argued it provides a necessary financial service to people in need of emergency funds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These policies are discriminatory and a form of censorship,&#8221; said Amy Cantu, a spokeswoman with the Community Financial Centers Association of America, the trade group representing payday lenders.</p>\n<p>State legislatures have long looked for ways to target payday lenders, but the payday lending industry has often found ways around new regulations. When several states capped the interest rates on payday loans, the industry pivoted into loans tied to auto titles or moved their operations onto Indian reservations.</p>\n<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is considering new regulations to further restrict the payday lending industry. The rules are expected to be released later this year.</p>\n<p>In a way, Google&#8217;s announcement will likely have more of an impact than any new regulation. The majority of Internet searches happen on Google and the company also controls the Internet&#8217;s largest advertising platforms. Google generates most of its ads through keyword searches, showing ads that are related to the subjects that its users are searching for.</p>\n<p>Under this ban, users searching for words like &#8220;loans&#8221; or &#8220;places to get money&#8221; will no longer pull up ads from payday lenders in the advertising section of the search results.</p>\n<p>Google, and its parent company Alphabet, has had a history of corporate activism. The company&#8217;s previous motto was &#8220;don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; which was replaced with &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; last year.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/google-to-ban-payday-lending-ads-says-industry-is-harmful-and-deceptive/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/google-payday_lenders.jpg?w=620\" title=\"Google-Payday_Lenders\" Abstract=\"Effective July 13, Google will no longer allow ads for loans due within 60 days and will also ban ads for loans where the interest rate is 36 per cent or higher.\" Credit=\"AP Photo/Jeff Chiu\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/google-payday_lenders.jpg?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/google-payday_lenders.jpg?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Google-Payday_Lenders</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Canadian banks got slightly better deal on Apple Pay: source</title>\n\t\t<link>http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/canadian-banks-got-slightly-better-deal-on-apple-pay-source</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/canadian-banks-got-slightly-better-deal-on-apple-pay-source#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 22:50:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Barbara Shecter]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[FP Street]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FP Tech Desk]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Apple Inc.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Apple Pay]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Royal Bank of Canada]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://business.financialpost.com/?p=658542</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The source characterized the arrangement as more in line with the lower fees paid to Apple in Australia and the United Kingdom]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A landmark deal by Canadian banks to embrace Apple Inc.\u2019s mobile wallet payment system Tuesday came on slightly more favourable terms than U.S. financial services firms received, according to a source familiar with the arrangement.</p>\n<p>While Apple Inc. will receive 0.15 per cent or 15 basis points on credit transactions \u2014 comparable to the widely reported figure for Apple Pay in the United States, which works out to 15 cents for every $100 purchased \u2014 a lower fee of four basis points will be applied to credit transactions after an annual payment of 50 cents per card.</p>\n<p>The source characterized the arrangement as more in line with the lower fees paid to Apple in Australia and the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>The deal in Canada, which came after months of negotiations, will broaden the availability of the tech giant\u2019s mobile wallet service Apple Pay.

Now, cheaper Android devices account for 51 per cent of the market, while iPhones hold just 39 per cent.</p>\n<p>\u201cApple Pay makes iPhones more valuable to consumers because it now provides more utility to them,\u201d Yigit says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s also why Apple is now more agreeable to getting out there with Apple Pay after a sluggish start \u2014 in effect, it&#8217;s about protecting their market share and competing with cheaper options.\u201d</p>\n<p>Apple Pay was launched on a small scale in Canada late last year without the support of any of the country\u2019s major banks. The initial rollout through American Express did not even include a co-branded American Express card issued by the Bank of Nova Scotia.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce began supporting Apple Pay through Interac debit and major credit cards. Customers can load the cards onto the latest iPhones and Apple Watches and use them to make purchases in stores that accommodate a contactless or tap-and-pay option.</p>\n<p>Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, and Bank of Nova Scotia have indicated they will begin supporting the Apple payments technology in the coming weeks. Sources say the short delay was elected in some cases so both in-store and \u201cin app\u201d purchases on the phones can be rolled out at the same time, while, in another case, systems work is still required to enable the payments technology.</p>\n<p>The big banks have embraced Apple\u2019s mobile payments system after developing their own mobile wallets, such as Toronto-Dominion Bank\u2019s UGO and TD Mobile Payment. While they remain committed to offering a full suite of options, a study in January by consumer and market research firm GfK revealed that mobile payments accounted for just three per cent of all transactions in Canada.</p>\n<p>There were signs of growth, though, with 63 per cent of Canadian consumer reporting having made at least one mobile transaction per month, up from three per cent in 2014.</p>\n<p>Analysts have suggested that Apple could get a benefit beyond a slice of the revenue if bank customers embrace Apple Pay: access to aggregated and anonymous data that can be analyzed provide insights into a much wider swathe of the Canadian population.</p>\n<p>Creating more \u201cvalue-added product for the end consumer \u2026 could theoretically place upward pressure on Apple\u2019s share of the interchange revenue over time,\u201d CIBC World Markets analysts Rob Sedran and Paul Holden said in a report last year.</p>\n<p>The analysts suggested the banks would want to strike the best deal for themselves at the outset, because the advantage after that could tip to Apple.</p>\n<p><em>Financial Post</em><br />\n<em><a

wireless carrier \u2013 and its coveted unused airwaves \u2013 for $465 million.</p>\n<p>Rogers confirmed Tuesday it will transfer approximately 150,000 Mobilicity consumers to Chatr, its other, albeit slightly more expensive, low-cost, no-contract service this summer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are working very hard to make this transition as smooth as possible and we\u2019ll share more details with

plans until joining Chatr, according to an emailed statement from Rogers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe most important thing for customers to know is that they should keep using their plans like they have been,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>The spokesperson noted that Chatr has broader coverage zones than Mobilicity, which offered unlimited talk, text and data plans in Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver for as little as $25 per month. Chatr\u2019s prepaid plans charge more for data, but are otherwise similar.</p>\n<p>Rogers said it will offer \u201ccomparable plans,\u201d but did not say whether prices will increase. Mobilicity\u2019s website states it will keep customers up-to-date as the transition occurs.</p>\n<p>Rogers will also convert a \u201clarge number\u201d of Mobilicity\u2019s 180 dealer locations to the Chatr brand (it has 1,500 already), but it\u2019s not clear whether there will be any impact on jobs.</p>\n<p>Mobilicity, originally known as Data and Audio-Visual Enterprises Wireless, first came on the scene in 2008 as part of the Harper government\u2019s push to spark competition in the wireless market. It bought AWS frequencies in the 2008 spectrum auction before launching in 2010.</p>\n<p>In 2013, Mobilicity wound up in court-supervised creditor protection. Rogers purchased it in a quick deal in June 2015 much to the chagrin of Telus, which attempted to buy the company three times but was rejected by regulators.</p>\n<p><em>Financial Post</em></p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/rogers-communications-to-axe-mobilicity-brand-move-customers-to-chatr/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/mobilicity.jpg?w=620\" title=\"mobilicity\" Abstract=\"Customers will not be able to add new Mobilicity lines after Aug. 15, but can change their current plans until joining Chatr, according to Rogers.\" Credit=\"Wayne Leidenfrost/ PNG\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/mobilicity.jpg?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/mobilicity.jpg?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">mobilicity</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Competition Bureau seeks Canadians\u2019 opinions on BCE proposal to buy Manitoba Telecom Services</title>\n\t\t<link>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/competition-bureau-seeks-input-from-canadians-on-bce-deal-to-buy-manitoba-telecom-services</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/competition-bureau-seeks-input-from-canadians-on-bce-deal-to-buy-manitoba-telecom-services#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 20:08:45 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Emily Jackson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[FP Tech Desk]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BCE Inc.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Manitoba Telecom Services Inc.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Telecom]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://financialpostcom.wordpress.com?p=658291&#038;preview_id=658291</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Competition Bureau is reviewing the proposed takeover as well as a side agreement that would see BCE sell a portion of the MTS wireless business to Telus]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>OTTAWA \u2014 The Competition Bureau is asking Canadians for their thoughts on BCE&#8217;s proposed deal to buy Manitoba Telecom Services.</p>\n<p>The federal regulator is reviewing the proposed takeover as well as a side agreement that would see BCE sell a portion of the MTS wireless business to Telus (TSX:T).</p>\n<p>The bureau says comments can be shared with the regulator through its website.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/bce-to-buy-manitoba-telecom-services-in-3-9-billion-deal\">BCE Inc $3.9 billion deal for Manitoba Telecom Services will test federal fourth-carrier policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/two-bankers-bruce-rothney-and-david-leith-were-there-for-birth-and-sale-of-manitoba-telecom\">Two bankers, Bruce Rothney and David Leith, were there for birth and sale of Manitoba Telecom</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>BCE (TSX:BCE) announced an agreement last week that it would buy MTS (TSX:MBT) in an offer that valued the company at $3.9 billion, including debt.</p>\n<p>The deal would also see BCE sell about one-third of Manitoba Telecom&#8217;s monthly contract wireless customers and one-third of the MTS stores in Manitoba to Telus.</p>\n<p>The Competition Bureau is reviewing the deal to see if it is likely to substantially lessen or prevent competition.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/competition-bureau-seeks-input-from-canadians-on-bce-deal-to-buy-manitoba-telecom-services/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/0510mts.jpg?w=620\" title=\"0510mts\" Abstract=\"BCE announced an agreement that it would buy MTS in an offer that valued the company at $3.9 billion, including debt.\" Credit=\"Brian Donogh/Winnipeg Sun/Postmedia Network\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/0510mts.jpg?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/0510mts.jpg?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">0510mts</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>&#8216;Leaning left&#8217;: Conservatives challenge Facebook saying &#8216;trending&#8217;

The social network uses the trending feature to indicate the most popular news articles of the day to users.</p>\n<p>Facebook denied the allegations after a backlash \u2014 from both conservative and liberal critics \u2014 erupted. &#8220;It is beyond disturbing to learn that this power is being used to silence viewpoints and stories that don&#8217;t fit someone else&#8217;s agenda,&#8221; read a statement from the Republican National Committee. &#8220;NOT LEANING IN&#8230; LEANING LEFT!&#8221; blared the top story on The Drudge Report, a widely read website.</p>\n<p>The journalist Glenn Greenwald, hardly a conservative ally, weighed in on Twitter: &#8220;Aside from fueling right-wing persecution, this is a key reminder of dangers of Silicon Valley controlling content.&#8221; And Alexander Marlow, the editor in chief of Breitbart News, a conservative-leaning publication, said the report confirmed &#8220;what conservatives have long suspected.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/personal-tech/facebook-launches-new-standalone-photo-sharing-moments-app-in-canada\">Facebook launches new, standalone photo-sharing \u2018Moments\u2019 app in Canada</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/facebook-inc-shares-open-at-record-high-heres-why-analysts-are-loving-the-tech-company-right-now\">Facebook shares open at record high: Here\u2019s why analysts are loving the tech company right now</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>Facebook, in response, says that it follows rigorous guidelines &#8220;to ensure consistency and neutrality&#8221; and that it works to be inclusive of all perspectives. &#8220;We take allegations of bias very seriously,&#8221; a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement. &#8220;Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The back-and-forth highlights the extent to which Facebook has muscled its way into the United States&#8217; political conversation \u2014 and the risks that the company faces as it becomes a central force in news consumption and production.</p>\n<p>With more than 222 million monthly active users in the United States and Canada, the site has become a place that people flock to to find out what is going on. Last year, a study by the Pew Research Center, in collaboration with the Knight Foundation, found that 63 per cent of Facebook&#8217;s users considered the service a news source.</p>\n<p>In April, Facebook embraced this role openly, releasing a video to implore people to search Facebook to discover &#8220;the other side of the story.&#8221; Politicians have increasingly shared their messages through the social network.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that Facebook has changed fundamentally over the past four, eight years,&#8221; said Paul Brewer, director of the University of Delaware Center for Political Communication. &#8220;It&#8217;s the sheer volume of communication that&#8217;s taking place, and it&#8217;s that politicians know that they need to be using Facebook now more than ever before to communicate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As it has become more influential, Facebook has taken pains to say that it is not an echo chamber of similar opinions. In a peer-reviewed study published last year, Facebook&#8217;s data scientists analyzed how 10.1 million of the most partisan American users on the social network navigated the site over a six-month period. They found that people&#8217;s networks of friends and the articles they saw were skewed toward their ideological preferences \u2014 but that the effect was more limited than the worst case some theorists had predicted, in which people would see almost no information from the other side.</p>\n<p>Yet Gizmodo&#8217;s report raises questions about the effects that Facebook&#8217;s staff members and their biases, even unconscious ones, have on the social network.</p>\n<p>While Facebook has pledged to sponsor both the Democratic and Republican national conventions, its top executives have not been shy about expressing where their political sympathies lie.</p>\n<p>At a Facebook conference in April, Mark Zuckerberg, the company&#8217;s chief executive, warned of &#8220;fearful voices building walls,&#8221; in reference to Donald Trump, the probable Republican presidential candidate.</p>\n<p>The allegations against Facebook also put the spotlight on how it chooses which news articles to show users under the trending function \u2014 on desktop computers, &#8220;trending&#8221; displays on the right side of screens; on cellphones, it appears when users search.</p>\n<p>Facebook has long described its trending feature as largely automatic. &#8220;The topics you see are based on a number of factors including engagement, timeliness, pages you&#8217;ve liked and your location,&#8221; according to a description on Facebook&#8217;s site.</p>\n<p>The trending feature is curated by a team of contract employees, according to two former Facebook employees who worked on it and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements. They said they considered themselves members of a newsroom-like operation, where editorial discretion was not novel but was an integral part of the process.</p>\n<p>Any &#8220;suppression,&#8221; the former employees said, was based on perceived credibility \u2014 any articles judged by curators to be unreliable or poorly sourced, whether left-leaning or right-leaning, were avoided, though this was a personal judgment call.</p>\n<p>The perception of Facebook as a more conventional news operation opens it to a more familiar line of criticism, which has been mounted against news organizations left and right, large and small, for decades. According to a report last year by Pew, only 17 per cent surveyed said that technology companies had a negative influence on the country. For the news media, that number was 65 per cent \u2014 and rising.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The agenda-setting power of a handful of companies like Facebook and Twitter should not be underestimated,&#8221; said Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of computer science and law at Harvard University. &#8220;These services will be at their best when they are explicitly committed to serving the interests of their users rather than simply offering a service whose boundaries for influence are unknown and ever-changing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>By late Monday, users on the social network looking for more information about the Gizmodo report did not have to look far: It was among the top articles trending on Facebook.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/leaning-left-conservatives-challenge-facebook-saying-trending-list-is-politically-biased/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/facebook-app.jpg?w=620\" title=\"Facebook-app\" Abstract=\"Facebook, in response, says that it follows rigorous guidelines &#039;to ensure consistency and neutrality&#039; and that it works to be inclusive of all perspectives.\" Credit=\"KAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/facebook-app.jpg?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/facebook-app.jpg?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Facebook-app</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Facebook launches new, standalone photo-sharing &#8216;Moments&#8217; app in Canada</title>\n\t\t<link>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/personal-tech/facebook-launches-new-standalone-photo-sharing-moments-app-in-canada</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/personal-tech/facebook-launches-new-standalone-photo-sharing-moments-app-in-canada#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 19:08:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh McConnell]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Personal Tech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Apps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Inc.]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://business.financialpost.com/?p=658259</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Facebook's take on making the photo-sharing experience more exhaustive comes after similar attempts by Google and Apple]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Facebook Inc. has launched a new mobile app in Canada and the EU today which the company says is a better way to keep user&#8217;s photos and videos organized.</p>\n<p>Called <a href=\"http://www.momentsapp.com/\">Moments</a>, the standalone app has the dedicated purpose of&nbsp;sharing photos or videos with friends privately. The idea behind it&nbsp;is that friends&nbsp;can create Moments groups based on location or&nbsp;who is in the photos, then share all of the content with each other (or pick and choose). So, for example, if a group of friends are at a wedding, they can come together in Moments and automatically get all of the photos shared in one large pot. Facebook says this should help reduce photo duplication, since people don&#8217;t have to stand next to each other taking the same photo, and makes sure a &#8220;moment&#8221; isn&#8217;t missed.</p>\n<p>Users are&nbsp;tagged in the photos or videos after Moments first tries to predict who is in them.&nbsp;Photos and videos in Moments aren&#8217;t sent&nbsp;to Facebook unless the user&nbsp;requests it. The app can also be used to create groups of friends or&nbsp;family elsewhere in the world to share media and isn&#8217;t limited to a geographic location.</p>\n<div class=\"npImgCentre\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:416px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-658274\" alt=\"Handout/Facebook\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/moments-english-3.png?w=416&#038;h=620\" width=\"416\" height=\"620\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Handout/Facebook</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">A screenshot of Facebook Inc&#039;s new Moments app, which launched in Canada on Tuesday.</span></div></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/facebook-says-government-requests-for-user-data-continue-to-increase-globally\">Facebook says government requests for user data continue to increase globally</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/viral-videos-donald-trump-and-baby-photos-how-we-have-created-facebook-a-money-machine\">Viral videos, Donald Trump and baby photos: How we have created Facebook a money machine</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>Moments was previously available in the U.S. and other countries around the world, but only came to Canada and the EU after it did some tweaking to how the app recognizes people in the photo. Facebook says instead of facial recognition software, which raised some concerns in other countries, Moments &#8220;uses a form of object recognition to group photos that look like they&#8217;re of the same person, based on features like the distance between their eyes and their ears.&#8221; It isn&#8217;t quite as accurate as facial recognition, but it should be&nbsp;better for user privacy.</p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s take on making the photo-sharing experience more exhaustive comes after similar attempts by Google with its Google Photos app or Apple&#8217;s iCloud Photo Sharing.

The facilities, located in Toronto and Quebec City, bring the number of regions in Microsoft&#8217;s cloud to 24. Globally, this represents a US$15 billion infrastructure investment.</p>\n<p>The Canadian datacentres, announced in June of last year, had to be doubled in capacity before they even opened, according to Microsoft Canada president Janet Kennedy, due to overwhelming demand. Almost 300 customers participated in pre-launch testing.</p>\n<p>Initially, the datacentres will offer Microsoft Azure and Office 365, but the company plans to add Dynamics CRM Online this fall, and later its ERP product, Dynamics AX.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/post-arcade/end-of-an-era-after-more-than-a-decade-microsoft-is-no-longer-making-the-xbox-360\">End of an era: After more than a decade, Microsoft is no longer making the Xbox 360</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/microsoft-corp-sues-u-s-justice-department-to-stop-government-from-forcing-handover-of-customer-data\">Microsoft Corp sues U.S. Justice Department to stop government from forcing handover of customer data</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>Additionally, Canadian customers can now connect directly to the Microsoft cloud through Azure ExpressRoute, whose private connections do not go over the public Internet, and offer more reliability, faster speeds and lower latencies than typical internet connections. Bell Canada is the first Canadian telecommunications partner to offer ExpressRoute.</p>\n<p>Customers such as Air Canada and Lululemon have already been using these services out of U.S. datacentres, noted Doug Hauger, general manager, national cloud programs at Microsoft, but, he said &#8220;Today, we&#8217;re giving customers the opportunity to address their data residency concerns.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, he added, &#8220;data residency is only one concern. Customers won&#8217;t use technology they don&#8217;t trust.&#8221; To that end, he said, Microsoft has achieved 37 compliance certifications and attestations used worldwide, and should there be additional requirements within a specific geography, it will implement them there.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re PCI compliant,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so when a customer or partner needs to be PCI compliant, they just go to the website, print out the paperwork, and sign it.&#8221; That process may be more onerous on other clouds, which merely provide instructions on how to become PCI compliant.</p>\n<p>The combination of rigorous security and data residency has lured a number of public sector institutions, including Province of Nova Scotia, Province of New Brunswick, City of Regina and the City of Brampton to Microsoft Cloud. &#8220;We&#8217;re so excited to have the public sector on board,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t move until we had datacentres in country.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Working with Microsoft is a tremendous opportunity for Nova Scotia. We encourage innovation and we are excited to be taking advantage of the newly opened Microsoft Canadian datacentre where we will begin moving more than 35,000 users to the Microsoft Canadian cloud over the coming years,&#8221; said Labi Kousoulis, Minister Internal Services, Province of Nova Scotia, in a statement. &#8220;Nova Scotia continues to be an innovative leader in Canada in many areas and this solution supports this visionary type of thinking.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Canadian SMBs are behind other developed countries, Kennedy noted. Many are still running very old ERP software \u2013 even some from the Y2K era. Dynamics AX on Azure will save them money, and then the question will turn to how they can innovate. &#8220;This is a chance for Canadians to catch up in productivity,&#8221; Kennedy said.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/cio/microsoft-corp-opens-new-canadian-datacentres-after-doubling-capacity-due-to-demand/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/microsoft.png?w=620\" title=\"MICROSOFT\" Abstract=\"The Canadian datacentres, announced in June of last year, had to be doubled in capacity.\" Credit=\"Akos Stiller/Bloomberg\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/microsoft.png?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/microsoft.png?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">MICROSOFT</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Canadian banks, including &#8216;the Big Five,&#8217; sign on for major Apple Pay expansion</title>\n\t\t<link>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/canadian-banks-including-the-big-five-sign-on-for-major-apple-pay-expansion</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/canadian-banks-including-the-big-five-sign-on-for-major-apple-pay-expansion#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 17:42:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Josh McConnell]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[FP Tech Desk]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Business]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Apple Inc.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Apple iPhone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Banking Services]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://business.financialpost.com/?p=657989</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Starting Tuesday, owners of the iPhone 6 and more recent models, as well as the Apple Watch, can add multiple cards from the various issuers into their digital wallet]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Two major Canadian banks have signed on to Apple Pay, marking a significant expansion of the tech giant\u2019s mobile wallet service in Canada.</p>\n<p>Starting Tuesday, Interac debit and major credit cards issued by Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce will support the payments technology, which allows users to load cards onto their iPhones and Apple Watches and make in-store purchases using their devices.</p>\n<p>Two other financial institutions, ATB Financial and Canadian Tire Financial Services, are also part of Tuesday\u2019s build-out, with the other three big banks rounding out Canada\u2019s Big Five expected to join in the coming months.</p>\n<p>The involvement of the big banks marks a milestone for Apple Pay, which launched on a small scale in Canada late last year through American Express.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled that seven of Canada\u2019s leading banks, including &#8230; every one of the Big Five, are bringing Apple Pay to their customers,\u201d said Jennifer Bailey, Apple\u2019s vice-president of Apple Pay, in an interview.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/personal-tech/apple-pay-may-be-a-hit-with-consumers-but-ubiquity-wont-come-until-banks-sign-on\">Apple Pay may be a hit with Canadian consumers, but ubiquity won\u2019t come until banks sign on</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/personal-tech/apple-pay-launches-in-canada-with-american-express-available-at-merchants-like-tim-hortons-indigo\">Apple Pay launches in Canada with American Express, available at merchants like Tim Hortons, Indigo</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/as-canadians-clamour-for-apple-pay-could-the-tech-giant-have-finally-met-its-match\">As Canadians clamour for Apple Pay, could the tech giant have finally met its match?</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>Starting Tuesday, owners of the iPhone 6 and more recent models, as well as the Apple Watch, can add multiple cards from the various issuers into their digital wallet, then select which one they want to use for a particular in-store transaction.

Canada \u2014 which is typically in the first wave of new Apple offerings \u2014 didn\u2019t get a taste of Apple Pay until 13 months later in November 2015, with its limited American Express launch.</p>\n<p>The Canadian expansion follows a period of uncertainty in the country\u2019s mobile wallet space, as the major financial institutions have been working to develop their own solutions.</p>\n<p>CIBC, Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal Bank of Canada are among the banks that were chasing after consumer digital transactions with their own apps.</p>\n<p>The banks, which have been in talks with Apple for months, had indicated that two issues were fundamental to any partnership with the tech giant: The need to maintain client security and to preserve client relationships.</p>\n<p>But the financial institutions were realistic, too, recognizing the pull of a brand like Apple and realizing that they did not want to put customers in the position of having to choose between their bank and their phone.</p>\n<p>The negotiations between Apple and the banks are also understood to have involved working out how the parties would share lucrative \u201cinterchange\u201d fees that are taken on each credit card transaction.</p>\n<p>Bank officials would not comment Monday on the financial terms of the Apple Pay agreement.</p>\n<p>Todd Roberts, CIBC\u2019s senior vice president of innovation, said that the important thing with joining Apple Pay is staying relevant with consumer demands and modern conveniences.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is another way for clients to use our great credit and debit cards, and put them in a digital wallet instead of a physical, leather one,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it is Apple Pay, suretap or CIBC\u2019s mobile wallet app, our job is to provide clients with safe, easy choices and this is another one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bringing Interac, the unique-to-Canada operation that handles all payment transfers between financial institutions, on board was also significant: without it Apple Pay would have been limited to credit cards.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that we will provide solutions that our clients want, but it\u2019s been very important to consumer and merchant clients that both debit and credit be supported,\u201d said RBC\u2019s Linda Mantia, executive vice president of digital, payments and cards.</p>\n<p>Bailey said the integration with Interac, which is part of Tuesday&#8217;s roll-out, was one of the major reasons for the delay in expanding Apple Pay.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdding a new network to Apple Pay\u2019s platform takes new work for both Apple and the network itself,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of the partners \u2014 the banks, Apple and the networks \u2014 have to build up this new integration and do full testing.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the Apple Pay launch, Interac developed an Interac Token Service Provider (TSP) that generates secure tokens for transactions. The token is encrypted, meaning without the key it is meaningless to third parties.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have been working on it for a year and half,\u201d said Avinash Chidambaram, Interac\u2019s vice president of product and platform development. \u201cBut we have also been working with Apple to educate them on the Canadian market [and] highlight our ubiquity.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is Interac\u2019s TSP and Apple\u2019s own encryption technology that the California-based company says makes Apple Pay one of the safest and most private ways to make transactions, particularly in a time when encryption, data leaks and privacy breaches are top of mind.</p>\n<div class=\"npImgCentre\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-658336\" alt=\"Laura Pedersen/National Post\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/applepay1.jpg?w=620&#038;h=465\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Laura Pedersen/National Post</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, shows how to use Apple Pay using her Apple Watch</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>\u201cWe designed Apple Pay from the beginning so that the information about your transaction really is between you, your merchant and your issuer,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cWhen you pay in store, Apple doesn\u2019t actually see that transaction because the credential is being initiated from your phone to the terminal, up through the network and then once approved it goes back through the payment rails.\u201d</p>\n<p>This means that the personal information does not need to be sent to or from Apple through its servers, nor does it have to leave the device\u2019s dedicated internal storage chip (called Secure Element). The data stays on the phone\u2019s chip and is only accessed locally during the purchase process.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe really wanted to keep the data about you private and give users that confidence that we aren\u2019t using that data to build profiles about them, do target advertising or anything like that,\u201d Bailey said.</p>\n<p>Bailey says Apple has been pleased with how Apple Pay has been received since it\u2019s initial launch in the U.S. Since then, the service has been available in six countries in various forms.</p>\n<p>\u201cConsumers have spent billions of dollars in Apple Pay,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are adding one million new users per week.\u201d</p>\n<p>The tech giant is hoping the momentum continues with this Canadian expansion and the country\u2019s high contactless adoption rate. Bailey said both Apple and the banks took note of Canadian feedback during the past 19 months.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you go back and look at social media, it is a great indicator of the excitement and people\u2019s reaction to Apple Pay,\u201d she said. \u201cThey (reach out) to partner banks saying, \u2018Hey we really want you to support Apple Pay.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p><em>With files from Barbara Shecter.</em></p>\n<p><em>Financial Post</em><br />\n<a href=\"mailto:jomcconnell@postmedia.com\"><em> jomcconnell@nationalpost.com</em></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/joshmcconnell\"><em>twitter.com/joshmcconnell</em></a></p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/canadian-banks-including-the-big-five-sign-on-for-major-apple-pay-expansion/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1_uqgjrmzl\" type=\"application/vnd.kaltura\" medium=\"featuredvideo\">\r\n\t\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"\" />\r\n\t\t\t<media:title><![CDATA[Canadian banks, including &#039;the Big Five,&#039;

counsel from referring to media reports quoting the leaked documents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However distasteful it may be that some of the email communications between Avid and its counsel may show wrongful or inappropriate conduct, the Court cannot and will not allow Plaintiffs to take advantage of the work of hackers to access documents outside the context of formal discovery,&#8221; Ross wrote in the order. &#8220;To do so would taint these proceedings and, if left unremedied, potentially undermine the integrity of the judicial process.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/inside-ashley-madison-calls-from-crying-spouses-fake-profiles-and-the-hack-that-changed-everything\">Inside Ashley Madison: Calls from crying spouses, fake profiles and the hack that changed everything</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/executive/leadership/former-ashley-madison-ceo-touts-philanthropic-generosity-as-he-looks-for-work-with-new-website\">Former Ashley Madison CEO touts \u2018philanthropic generosity\u2019 as he looks for work with new website</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/from-cougar-life-to-established-men-the-real-backstory-behind-ashley-madisons-fake-founders-for-its-spinoff-sites\">The women who fooled everyone by pretending to be executives at Ashley Madison\u2019s sister websites</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>Last summer, hackers dumped Ashley Madison&#8217;s user database online, exposing the personal information of people who had signed up in search of an affair. In a separate leak, they also released the contents of then-chief executive Noel Biderman&#8217;s email account, which contained sensitive internal documents and correspondence.</p>\n<p>Michael Crystal, a class action lawyer at&nbsp;Spiteri &amp; Ursulak LLP who specializes in privacy and data breaches, said this issue has yet to be tested in court in Canada. In the U.S., the order sets an important precedent that will make it more difficult for the victims of corporate data breaches to seek redress, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is a game-changer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It penalizes those who suffered a privacy breach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs will have to rely on documents they can obtain through discovery to support&nbsp;their lawsuit, which they hope to certify as a class action. That means emails between Avid Life Media executives and the company&#8217;s&nbsp;lawyers released by the hackers will almost certainly be excluded under solicitor-client privilege.</p>\n<p>Those emails include correspondence between Biderman and lawyers about how to&nbsp;avoid legal trouble over the computer-generated messages sent&nbsp;to male Ashley Madison users, which were meant to make them think&nbsp;they were talking to a woman interested in a tryst so they would&nbsp;spend more money on the site. They also include&nbsp;internal discussion of&nbsp;corporate data security.</p>\n<p>Avid Life&#8217;s lawyers argued the emails and documents were stolen, making it unethical and unfair for the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers to use them to build their case. Three former Ashley Madison users who are not part of the proposed class action filed a memorandum in support of the defendants&#8217; motion, arguing&nbsp;it would encourage further dissemination of their personal information if the judge ruled the hacked data and documents are part of the public domain.</p>\n<p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs responded by arguing the&nbsp;documents and media reports quoting them are already&nbsp;freely available to anyone with an Internet connection. &#8220;Plaintiffs and their attorneys, who played no role in obtaining or publishing the documents, are entitled to rely on this public information in preparing their pleadings,&#8221; they wrote.</p>\n<p>The order was the second blow to the plaintiffs in less than a month. On April 6, Ross ruled that&nbsp;former Ashley Madison users who want to participate in the lawsuit must use their real names.</p>\n<p>Avid Life Media, its lead lawyers, and the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:cbrownell@nationalpost.com\">cbrownell@nationalpost.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://Twitter.com/clabrow\">Twitter.com/clabrow</a></p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/hacked-emails-ruled-off-limits-in-ashley-madison-lawsuit/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/ashley-madison.jpg?w=620\" title=\"ashley-madison\" Abstract=\"Last summer, hackers dumped Ashley Madison&#039;s user database online, exposing the personal information of people who had signed up in search of an affair.\" Credit=\"Canadian Press\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/ashley-madison.jpg?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/05/ashley-madison.jpg?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">ashley-madison</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>IBM offers quantum computing in the cloud, Adobe acquires Livefyre: News IT leaders need to know</title>\n\t\t<link>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/cio/ibm-offers-quantum-computing-in-the-cloud-adobe-acquires-livefyre-news-it-leaders-need-to-know</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/cio/ibm-offers-quantum-computing-in-the-cloud-adobe-acquires-livefyre-news-it-leaders-need-to-know#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 22:04:38 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Lynn Greiner]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[CIO]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Adobe Systems Inc.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Apple Inc.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[IBM Corporation]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Information Technology Sector]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[VMware Inc.]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://business.financialpost.com/?p=657575</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Apple and SAP partner on enterprise apps, VMware and Pivotal collaborate and IBM offers quantum computing in the cloud: Just some of this week\u2019s news]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Apple and SAP partnering on enterprise applications, VMware and Pivotal collaborating&nbsp;and IBM offering&nbsp;quantum computing in the cloud are some of the highlight in this week&#8217;s news.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft changes rules for admins</h3>\n<p>Enterprise administrators used to be able to block access to the Windows Store to prevent download of unapproved applications by users running Windows 10 Pro, but no longer. The company has <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3135657\">altered its policy</a>, and now only permits disabling the Store in the Enterprise and Education versions of Windows 10. In a <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-no-longer-allows-administrators-to-block-windows-store-access-in-windows-10-pro/\">statement reported by ZDNet</a>, it said, &#8220;Windows 10 Enterprise is our offering that provides IT pros with the most granular control over company devices. Windows 10 Pro offers a subset of those capabilities and is recommended for small and mid-size businesses looking for some management controls, but not the full suite necessary for IT pros at larger enterprises. The ability to block access to the Windows Store is typically for organizations who want more control over corporate-owned devices. This fits into the value of Windows 10 Enterprise.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Apple partners with SAP</h3>\n<p>Apple and SAP have <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/apple-inc-and-sap-se-to-work-together-on-developing-iphone-ipad-apps-for-businesses\">announced</a> a partnership to produce apps that run on SAP HANA for the iPhone and iPad. It includes the release of a software development kit (SDK) to help customers and partners build native iOS apps, as well as tools and training for SAP developers. SAP will develop native business apps for iOS using Apple&#8217;s Swift programming language, generating the user interface with SAP Fiori for iOS design language. Rollout is scheduled by the end of the year.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/cio/hp-releases-new-chromebook-yammer-expands-and-ntp-patches-news-it-leaders-need-to-know\">HP releases new Chromebook, Yammer expands and NTP patches: News IT leaders need to know</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/cio/uninstalling-apple-quicktime-and-new-open-source-programming-tool-news-it-leaders-need-to-know\">Uninstalling Apple QuickTime and new open source programming tool: News IT leaders need to know</a></li></ul></div>\n<h3>VMware and Pivotal collaborate on cloud-native stack</h3>\n<p>VMware and Pivotal have <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/vmw-newsfeed/Pivotal-and-VMware-Team-Up-to-Accelerate-Deployment-of-Cloud-Native-Applications-With-Advanced-Enterprise-Cloud-Solution/3088979-manual\">announced the release</a> of their joint enterprise cloud-native stack, comprised of Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform and VMware&#8217;s Photon Platform.
