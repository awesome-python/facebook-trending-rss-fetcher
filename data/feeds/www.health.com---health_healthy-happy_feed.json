The trade group&nbsp;has reported that each week, about 23%&nbsp;of American adults use a <a href=\"http://www.chpa.org/Acetaminophen.aspx\">medicine containing acetaminophen</a>.&nbsp;<span>In the new study, researchers at The&nbsp;Ohio State University set out to investigate the med&#39;s impact on empathy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In one experiment, they had&nbsp;40 college students&nbsp;drink a liquid containing 1,000mg&nbsp;of acetaminophen, while another group of 40 students was given a placebo liquid. The&nbsp;students then read scenarios in which someone suffered some sort of ache</span>&mdash;<span>physical or emotional</span>&mdash;<span>and were&nbsp;asked to rate the pain those people&nbsp;experienced. The&nbsp;study&nbsp;participants who drank the acetaminophen rated their suffering&nbsp;as significantly lower&nbsp;compared to the students who drank the placebo.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20789184,00.html\">Natural Cures for Headaches</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In a second experiment, again&nbsp;one group of students was given acetaminophen, and the other, a</span><span>&nbsp;placebo. Then they were all exposed to short blasts of white noise, and asked to rate the noise</span><span>&nbsp;on a scale from 1 (not unpleasant) to 10 (extremely unpleasant). Finally, they were asked to imagine how unpleasant those blases of noise</span><span>&nbsp;would seem to others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Compared to the placebo group, the students who took acetaminophen rated the noise as being less unpleasant, and predicted that the noises&nbsp;would be less unpleasant for others as well.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why acetaminophen is having these effects, but it is concerning,&rdquo; said researcher&nbsp;Baldwin Way, PhD, in a press release. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://news.osu.edu/news/2016/05/10/empathy-reliever/\">Empathy is important</a>. If you are having an argument with your spouse and you just took acetaminophen, this research suggests you might be less understanding of what you did to hurt your spouse&#39;s feelings.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In an earlier study, Way and his co-author&nbsp;Dominik Mischkowski, PhD, found that acetaminophen may have another unexpected side effect: dulling&nbsp;positive emotions, like&nbsp;joy.&nbsp;</span><span>It&#39;s seems there may be&nbsp;a lot we don&#39;t know about over-the-counter painkillers. Next&nbsp;Mischkowski and Way&nbsp;plan to study another common painkiller, ibuprofen, to see if it&#39;s&nbsp;linked to similar effects.</span></p>\r\n]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/200x150/public/styles/main/public/gettyimages-97849341.jpg?itok=ql-m7ovA\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/75x75/public/styles/main/public/gettyimages-97849341.jpg?itok=FTZJTIfS\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><p>Getty Images</p>\r\n</media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <title>\n    <![CDATA[14 Surprising Causes of Dehydration\r\n]]>  </title>\n  <link>\n  <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20815262,00.html]]>  </link>\n  <pubDate>\n    <![CDATA[Wed, 16 Jul 2014 09:20:00 -0400]]>  </pubDate>\n  <dc:creator>\n    <![CDATA[<p>K.

Reach for the stars! Embrace the whole new world waiting for you on the other side of graduation!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;re a <em>little</em> less likely to mention what really matters when it comes to securing your long-term success. A lot of it involves adjusting to adult life and learning what it means to be healthy, both physically and mentally&mdash;and&nbsp;that&#39;s a struggle for many new grads.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A</span><span>fter you change out of your cap and gown, keep this cheat sheet on health&nbsp;</span><span>mistakes to avoid in mind. You&#39;ll be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/adulting?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\">#adulting</a> like a pro in no time.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mistake #1: Going to urgent care for all your medical needs</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We get it: you&#39;re young, you&#39;re healthy, and you haven&#39;t been sick since that unfortunate case of mono in the 11th grade. But building a relationship with a primary care doctor now establishes your baseline level of health and allows for continuity of care. And, in parts of the country where there are <a href=\"http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-primary-care-policy-center/Publications_PDFs/2007_IJHS_Macinko.pdf\">more primary care physicians</a>, people live longer and have lower rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and other medical conditions, according to study published in the&nbsp;<em>International Journal of Health Services</em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If none of that&#39;s enough to sway you, then remember: on many insurance plans, a trip to the emergency room or urgent&nbsp;care is more expensive than a visit to a PCP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://news.health.com/2016/02/09/the-early-signs-of-stroke-you-need-to-know-even-if-youre-young/\">The Early Signs of Stroke You Need to Know&mdash;Even if You&#39;re Young</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mistake #2: Skipping health insurance</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of insurance, you really won&#39;t be saving any money if you don&#39;t sign up for it after you graduate. The Affordable Care Act says you&nbsp;<i>have&nbsp;</i>to&nbsp;be insured,&nbsp;and you can get <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/\">hit with a fine</a> if you don&rsquo;t register quickly enough. You can usually be added to a parent&rsquo;s health plan if it covers dependents and you&rsquo;re under 26&mdash;even if you&#39;re living on your own. If you&rsquo;re younger than 30, you can buy <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/choose-a-plan/plans-categories/#catastrophic\">a catastrophic plan with low monthly premiums</a>; you&rsquo;ll pay most non-emergency medical expenses yourself, but coverage includes three&nbsp;primary care visits each year&mdash;as well as preventive care like shots and screenings&mdash;before you hit your deductible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mistake #3: Eating a sad desk lunch every day&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Chowing down in front of the computer might seem like a good way to gain traction at a new job. In fact, one 2012 survey found that <a href=\"http://www.right.com/wps/wcm/connect/right-us-en/home/thoughtwire/categories/media-center/Just+OneinFive+Employees+Take+Actual+Lunch+Break\">39% of employees spend their lunch breaks at their desks</a>. Truth is, in the working world, many of us aren&rsquo;t counterbalancing our hours of inactivity with regular movement (such as crisscrossing campus for classes). Moreover, &ldquo;when we eat distracted, we tend not to enjoy, appreciate, or even register the calories&mdash;they&rsquo;re calories eaten, calories forgotten,&rdquo; says Katherine Zeratsky, RD, an associate professor of nutrition at the Mayo Clinic. &ldquo;If you absolutely <em>have </em>to eat at your desk, appreciate each bite of food in your mouth, chew it, notice that you&rsquo;re chewing it&mdash;and do so at least several times before you swallow it&mdash;and <em>then </em>type a paragraph or read what you have to read. If you can take a bit of time to appreciate your food, you&rsquo;re less likely to be looking for a snack an hour or two later because you forgot you ate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mistake #4: Getting out of the exercise habit</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular exercise at a campus gym? No sweat. Juggling physical fitness with an entirely new set of life circumstances? Not so straightforward. Researchers have found<span> that even elite college athletes <a href=\"http://sph.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/05/09/1941738114534813\">struggle to exercise consistently</a> after graduation, and that </span><em>everyone </em><span>who wants to squeeze into their favorite big-game tee a few years later stands a better chance of doing so if they <a href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20907868,00.html\">make exercise a habit</a> ASAP.&nbsp;First step: Find an activity you really love, whether it&#39;s SoulCycle, <a href=\"http://news.health.com/2016/01/13/orangetheory-fitness-trend-2015-facts/\">Orangetheory</a>, CrossFit, dance classes, or something else. </span>Those people you know who get up at 6 a.m. to run do it because they truly enjoy it (we hope).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20907868,00.html\">10 Habits of People Who Love to Work Out</a></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mistake #5: Ignoring stress </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A study in <em>Social Science &amp; Medicine </em>linked <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614007503\">student loan debt to poor mental health</a> for young men and women. Generation Opportunity, a nonpartisan youth advocacy group, reported that the national unemployment rate for people between ages 18 and 29&nbsp;is <a href=\"http://generationopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/State_of_the_Millennial_2016.pdf\">more than double</a> that of Americans older than 29. Finding one&rsquo;s way in the working world has never been easy, but some argue that it&rsquo;s never been harder than it is right now&mdash;and millennials report <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2014/stress-report.pdf\">higher levels of stress</a> than any other generation. &ldquo;Stress can impact everything from one&rsquo;s sleep to their energy, attention, concentration, and interpersonal relationships,&rdquo; says Simon Rego, PsyD, director of psychology training at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re experiencing some of those symptoms at a level that is uncomfortable or that people are commenting on, it may be a good idea to seek support from a friend or loved one, or, if necessary, professional help.&rdquo; Talking to a pro, Rego notes, yields the long-term benefit of developing skills that will help you manage life better for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mistake #6: Developing a Seamless addiction</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The idea that takeout food is cheaper than healthier home-cooked meals </span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/opinion/sunday/is-junk-food-really-cheaper.html?_r=0\">is a myth</a><span>, plain and simple. So is the idea that preparing your own meals is a time suck. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be a chef in order to cook,&rdquo; says Zeratsky. &ldquo;You can love to cook or you can hate to cook, you can have no time or you can have all the time in the world; you don&rsquo;t have to be a gourmet to put a healthy meal on the table. Think back to the basics of what comprises a nutritious meal: Do you have a fruit or a vegetable, a protein-rich food, something starchier that will provide you with good energy? It might not look like what you see on a cooking show or at a restaurant, but it&rsquo;s a complete meal.&rdquo; Almost </span><em>anything </em><span>you prepare for yourself, experts argue, will provide better nourishment than hyperprocessed fast food ever could.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mistake #7: Happy hour wings and beer five&nbsp;nights a week</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;re going to be spending 40 hours a week with your new coworkers&mdash;probably more time than you spend with your friends and family. So it&#39;s important to forge friendships in the office, and a common way to do it is hitting the bar after work.&nbsp;In one survey, 82% of respondents who headed to happy hour said they did so to <a href=\"http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?id=pr439&amp;sd=6%2F24%2F2008&amp;ed=12%2F31%2F2008\">bond with their coworkers</a>. But those bargain drinks and buckets of wings add up fast. A beer rings in at around 145 calories, and those savory little snacks are 50 to 100 calories apiece, even when you haven&rsquo;t dipped them in anything. Keep an eye out for <a href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20365592,00.html\">lower-calorie options</a>, and don&rsquo;t be shy about bowing out before someone suggests karaoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mistake #8: Forgetting what you learned in sex ed</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the CDC, reported cases of three STDs (syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea) are <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2015/std-surveillance-report-press-release.html\">on the rise</a> in the United States&nbsp;for the first time in a decade&mdash;and STDs continue to affect young people, particularly young women, most severely. Some health department officials believe <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/blame-tinder-rhode-island-social-media-stds-sexually-transmitted-diseases/\">online-dating apps like Tinder are to blame</a>, and they could have a point; while moving to a city and turning to your phone to meet a friendly stranger <em>can </em>be good, clean fun, with sexual freedom comes responsibility. Playing it safe means testing and treatment for STDs (the CDC recommends that sexually active women under 25 be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea, which often have no symptoms and go undetected, every year) and using condoms consistently and correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Mistake #9: Losing contact with friends and family</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In college, your friends lived down the hallway from you. Now, you&#39;re lucky if you live in the same city, or even the same state. But&nbsp;even if you don&rsquo;t have a whirlwind wedding engagement or splashy new job title to report, keeping up with old pals after graduation is worth the time and energy. &ldquo;People are social beings and therefore we derive a lot of benefits from staying in contact with others,&rdquo; says Rego. &ldquo;This includes emotional support and comfort and a sense of belonging. These benefits help create a buffer against daily and life stressors that come our way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/200x150/public/1462380232/GettyImages-563877127.jpg?itok=BFRsRghp\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/75x75/public/1462380232/GettyImages-563877127.jpg?itok=zB2lJn3D\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\">Getty Images</media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <title>\n    <![CDATA[5 Things to Know About Your Fertility\r\n]]>  </title>\n  <link>\n  <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/mind-body/fertility-facts]]>  </link>\n  <pubDate>\n    <![CDATA[Wed, 04 May 2016 17:28:19 -0400]]>  </pubDate>\n  <dc:creator>\n    <![CDATA[Health]]>  </dc:creator>\n  <section><![CDATA[ ]]></section> \n  <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n    <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/mind-body/fertility-facts]]>  </guid>\n  <description>\n    <![CDATA[Starting to think about having a family?

And while she often deserved the flak, she also dispensed gems of wisdom on countless other subjects, from balancing a budget to becoming an individual, at a time when most women&rsquo;s magazines taught housewives how to whip up the perfect pot roast and wax the floors before their husbands got home. Here are some of the best life lessons, both big and small, I discovered while writing a new biography of HGB, <em>Enter Helen: The Invention of Helen Gurley Brown and the Rise of the Modern Single Woman </em>($29; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Enter-Helen-Invention-Gurley-Modern/dp/0062342665\">amazon.com</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Take your pleasure seriously</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What is a sexy woman?

She is a woman who enjoys sex,&rdquo; Helen wrote in her 1962 bestseller,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Single-Girl-Before-Classics/dp/1569802521/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462293216&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=Sex+and+the+Single+Girl\"><em>Sex and the Single Girl</em></a>. It was a shocking message at the time (nice girls weren&rsquo;t supposed to have sex before marriage, let alone&nbsp;<em>enjoy</em>&nbsp;it), and it&rsquo;s one that she continued to deliver for the rest of her career: The more pleasure you get, the more pleasure you give.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Work hard and pay your dues</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a young woman, Helen worked 17 secretarial jobs before she became a high-powered and high-paid ad copywriter &agrave; la Peggy Olson. In&nbsp;<em>Sex and the Single Girl</em>, she shared what she learned along the way.&nbsp;Rule Number 1: &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T DEMAND INSTANT GLAMOUR.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give yourself time to get useful before you get difficult,&rdquo; she advised.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pack your lunch</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I know it&rsquo;s not the sexiest advice, but it is sound. When I worked at a magazine in Manhattan, I easily dropped $20 on an average meal, spending up to $100 a week! In <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Office-Classics-Helen-Gurley-Brown/dp/1569802750/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1462293430&amp;sr=1-2\"><em>Sex and the Office</em></a>, Helen provides two Brown Paper Bag Plans designed to fill up the working girl without draining her wallet. &ldquo;Home-lunch can be delicious glamor-girl fodder instead of junk,&rdquo; she wrote, adding that you can even &ldquo;save enough money to spend Christmas in Jamaica.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"http://news.health.com/2016/01/12/5-mental-blocks-that-are-ruining-your-sex-life/\">5 Mental Blocks That Are Ruining Your Sex Life</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Listen to people</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Never fail to know that if you are doing all the talking, you are boring somebody,&rdquo; Helen wrote in her 1982 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Having-All-Helen-Gurley-Brown/dp/0283989866/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462293476&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=having+it+all+helen\"><em>Having It All</em></a>. A conversation should be two-sided. Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to listen and learn.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sit up straight</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Helen gave a lot of nutty beauty advice over the years (she advocated wigs, plastic surgery, and lots of makeup), but this tip is timeless: &ldquo;Sit up straight, stand up straight, posture, posture, <em>posture</em>!&rdquo; she wrote in her 2000 book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Again-Helen-Gurley-Brown/dp/0446610003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462293536&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=i%27m+wild+again+helen\"><em>I&rsquo;m Wild Again</em></a>. &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20446224,00.html\">Good posture</a> can make more difference in how you look than virtually anything else&rdquo;&mdash;and the best part is, it&rsquo;s free.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Let your problems be your fuel</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A self-described &ldquo;mouseburger&rdquo; from Arkansas, Helen told and retold the tale of her childhood: Her father died young, her mother sunk into depression, her sister contracted polio, and the family fell on hard times. But those hard times also fueled Helen&rsquo;s need to succeed. &ldquo;Early-in-life problems can be the yeast that makes you rise into <em>bread</em>!&rdquo; she once wrote. In other words, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.

I am floating in a foot of salt water, inside a light-proof, sound-proof tank. The air and the water are about the same temperature as my skin, and I realize I&rsquo;m not sure where my body ends and my surroundings begin. I suddenly feel dizzy, and a wave of nausea washes over me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two minutes down, 58 to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am here, belly up in this pod, to see what floatation therapy is all about. In the last five years or so, the practice has grown wildly in popularity, with float centers springing up&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=\"http://floatationlocations.com/map/\" href=\"http://floatationlocations.com/map/\">across the country</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Devotees claim floating transports the mind and body, offering profound relaxation, and a variety of other benefits, from pain reduction to&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=\"http://news.health.com/2014/10/21/6-ways-to-be-a-creative-genius/\" href=\"http://news.health.com/2014/10/21/6-ways-to-be-a-creative-genius/\">enhanced creativity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20977819,00.html\" href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20977819,00.html\">better sleep</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED:</strong>&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20307153,00.html\" href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20307153,00.html\">Yoga Moves to Beat Insomnia, Ease Stress, and Relieve Pain</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few more minutes into my session, I start to get why people do this: As I focus on my breath&mdash;in and out&mdash;my tension melts away. I close my eyes and imagine myself drifting on a cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I hear the signal that the session is over, I can&rsquo;t believe an hour has passed. I know I didn&rsquo;t nod off. But my brain had somehow slipped out of its regular rhythm into an altogether different state where I lost track of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I climb out of the pod, I feel a deep sense of calm, and incredibly refreshed&mdash;like I just woke up from the&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=\"http://news.health.com/2014/12/01/how-to-have-great-nap/\" href=\"http://news.health.com/2014/12/01/how-to-have-great-nap/\">best nap</a>&nbsp;of my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The majority of people that achieve that restful state, they report the same type of effect,&rdquo; says physical therapist Robert Schreyer when I tell him about my float. He is co-owner of the&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=\"http://www.nyaspire.com/floatation.html\" href=\"http://www.nyaspire.com/floatation.html\">Aspire Center for Health and Wellness</a>&nbsp;in New York City, which allowed me to float for free as a journalist in one of their two pods. (The usual price is $90.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schreyer and his staff often recommend that their physical therapy patients float before an appointment. &ldquo;When they get out, their muscles are more relaxed, and our interventions can be much more effective,&rdquo; he explains. That benefit may have something to do with the 1,000 pounds of Epsom salts&mdash;or magnesium sulfate&mdash;dissolved in the bath to make the water denser, and thus floaters more buoyant. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of theories that magnesium provides muscle relaxation,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a data-mce-href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20800897,00.html\" href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20800897,00.html\">15 Natural Back Pain Remedies</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But floating seems to be beneficial for everyone,&quot; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ultimate way to detach.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out in Tulsa, Oklahoma, clinical neuropsychologist Justin Feinstein, PhD, is trying to understand that&nbsp;mental piece&nbsp;of the float phenomenon. Feinstein is the director of the only float lab in the U.S.&mdash;the&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=\"http://www.laureateinstitute.org/justin-feinstein.html\" href=\"http://www.laureateinstitute.org/justin-feinstein.html\">Float Clinic and Research Center</a>&nbsp;at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research.&nbsp;His team has been using wireless, waterproof sensors and fMRI scans to collect data on what happens in the brain while people float.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our preliminary analyses are showing that the stress circuits of the brain are shutting off post-float,&rdquo; Feinstein tells me over the phone. Once he finishes this current study, he plans to explore the therapeutic potential of floating for people who suffer from anxiety, especially PTSD.&nbsp;(To avoid triggering claustrophobia in subjects, the lab has&nbsp;a specially designed open tank in a light-proof, sound-proof room.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So what is it about floating that makes it so restorative?&rdquo; I ask him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most likely a combination of a lot of variables,&rdquo; he explains. For one, you&rsquo;re in a near-zero gravity state, he says, which gives your body a chance to relax. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re also reducing external sensory input to the brain&mdash;reduced light, reduced sound, reduced proprioception, or how you feel your body in space.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why people refer to floating as a form of sensory deprivation. But Feinstein says that&rsquo;s actually a misnomer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re finding in our research is that floating is a form of sensory enhancement,&rdquo; he says, because it allows you to tune into your own body&mdash;especially your heartbeat and your breathing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It becomes an ideal environment for mindful meditation,&rdquo; Feinstein points out. &ldquo;For anyone who may have trouble&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=\"http://news.health.com/2015/08/13/a-simple-guided-breathing-meditation/\" href=\"http://news.health.com/2015/08/13/a-simple-guided-breathing-meditation/\">focusing on their breath</a>&nbsp;outside of the tank, floating makes it lot easier to enter into a meditative state.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a data-mce-href=\"http://news.health.com/2015/10/08/this-easy-meditation-method-will-help-calm-your-anxiety/\" href=\"http://news.health.com/2015/10/08/this-easy-meditation-method-will-help-calm-your-anxiety/\">This Easy meditation Method Will Help Clam Your Anxiety</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What he says explains so much about my experience: I must have reached a meditative state during my float without even trying. I have never been able to meditate before. It had always seemed impossible to quiet the incessant chatter in my head. But inside the pod, it seemed to happen automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein believes floating can help many other people like me&mdash;which could be a powerful thing, considering the proven&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=\"http://www.health.com/health/article/0,,20793239,00.html\" href=\"http://www.health.com/health/article/0,,20793239,00.html\">health benefits of meditation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for me, my float has inspired me to try again to&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=\"http://news.health.com/2014/11/18/5-meditation-tips-for-people-who-cant-focus/\" href=\"http://news.health.com/2014/11/18/5-meditation-tips-for-people-who-cant-focus/\">meditate the traditional way</a>.

(Ripa was reportedly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/business/media/kelly-ripas-absence-from-live-points-up-rancor-at-abc.html?_r=0\">blindsided</a>&nbsp;when she learned about his departure minutes before the announcement on April 19.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;I needed a couple of days to gather my thoughts,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20981907_21002497,00.html\">Ripa told the&nbsp;<em>Live!&nbsp;</em>audience</a><span>&nbsp;on Tuesday. &ldquo;After 26 years with this company I earned the right &hellip; I always speak from the heart so I didn&rsquo;t want to come out here and say something I regret.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>We were impressed to say the least. Ripa handled the drama like a pro, and also noted that the events at ABC started a conversation &ldquo;about communication, consideration, and most importantly, respect in the workplace&rdquo;&mdash;which may be why her experience is resonating with so many people.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Who can&rsquo;t relate to feeling hot under the collar at work? &ldquo;Colleagues don&rsquo;t always act the way you want them to act, and situations don&rsquo;t roll out the way you want them to,&rdquo; says Alexandra Levit, a workplace consultant and co-chair of DeVry University&rsquo;s Career Advisory Board. But it&rsquo;s important to keep your cool to protect your reputation, she says. Here, a few anger coping tips from Levit and other experts to help you channel your rage in a productive way.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"http://www.health.com/mind-body/anger-management-tips\">This Is the Best Way to Handle Your Anger</a></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Take a breather</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Ripa took a few days off to gain perspective. But even a few minutes can help when you&rsquo;re about to boil over. Say, &ldquo;I need to run to the restroom and I&rsquo;ll catch up with you in a couple of minutes.&rdquo; Even if you&rsquo;re in a meeting.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to get out and look weird, than be somewhere you can&rsquo;t control yourself,&rdquo; Levit says.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Losing control is a risk you can&rsquo;t afford to take, as Brad Bushman, PhD, a professor of communication and psychology at The Ohio State University, explained to&nbsp;</span><em>Health</em><span>&nbsp;in an earlier interview. &quot;Angry people are highly aroused and when people get aroused, they do and&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20581256_2,00.html\">say things they later regret</a><span>.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>After you&rsquo;ve left the scene, call a trusted friend to vent, suggests Levit. Or simply count: Counting&mdash;slowly&mdash;to whatever number seems appropriate gives your blood pressure and heart rate a chance to return to normal. The way Bushman put it: &quot;As time passes, arousal diminishes.&quot;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Then, head back in. &ldquo;The situation might be the same, but you got the emotion out of it, reducing the likelihood that the scenario will escalate,&rdquo; says Levit. Because flipping your lid is never a good idea. &ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re in the right, no one will remember that. All they&rsquo;ll remember is that you screamed,&rdquo; she says.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Know your triggers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Gretchen Rubin, best-selling author of&nbsp;</span><em>The Happiness Project,&nbsp;</em><span>recommends doing some self-reflection to assess what fuels your fury. In a prior interview, she suggested, &ldquo;Is it because work seems meaningless? Because you can never get all your tasks done? Or because you have a&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.health.com/mind-body/anger-management-tips\">conflict with a co-worker?</a><span>&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>When you can anticipate your anger, you can practice coping in advance, says Levit. For example, you might imagine your boss criticizing you in a meeting. In front of a mirror, practice exactly how you&rsquo;d respond while remaining calm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Tune into what triggers you to feel stressed, too. &ldquo;Stress can lead to anger, which can make you lose control,&rdquo; Levit points out. So if you know that tight deadlines freak you out, for example, try to work ahead so you&rsquo;re not racing against the clock.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\u200bRELATED: </strong><a href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20765943,00.html\">Best and Worst Ways to Cope with Stress</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Look for the positive</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>When your expectations haven&rsquo;t been met, try to spin the scenario so it&rsquo;s less painful. Instead of thinking so-and-so&nbsp;</span><em>should&nbsp;</em><span>have done this or that, rephrase your thought train, Levit suggests. Start by stating how you have liked things to go down, and then name something you appreciate about your job:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>I would have liked if my colleague did such-and-such. But since she didn&rsquo;t, I have to remember I [have a great job/get paid well/love what I do/make a difference]. So I&rsquo;m going to figure out how to get past this.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Team members who can &ldquo;make lemonade out of lemons&rdquo; are usually well-liked and valued in the workplace, she adds. &ldquo;People who can come back from adverse situations have better reputations.&rdquo;</p>\r\n]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/200x150/public/styles/main/public/gettyimages-519180422.jpg?itok=HANTe9UB\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/75x75/public/styles/main/public/gettyimages-519180422.jpg?itok=LHN-XLoP\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><p>Getty Images</p>\r\n</media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <title>\n    <![CDATA[Why I Snack\r\n]]>  </title>\n  <link>\n  <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/health/video/0,,20988183,00.html]]>  </link>\n  <pubDate>\n    <![CDATA[Thu, 17 Mar 2016 12:09:00 -0400]]>  </pubDate>\n  <dc:creator>\n    <![CDATA[Health]]>  </dc:creator>\n  <section><![CDATA[ ]]></section> \n  <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n    <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/health/video/0,,20988183,00.html]]>  </guid>\n  <description>\n    <![CDATA[Kevin Curry was a regular gym-goer, but wasn&#39;t seeing the benefits of his workouts.
