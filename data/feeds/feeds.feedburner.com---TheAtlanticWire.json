Other activities, including graduation ceremonies and yearbooks, are also covered.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"primary-categorization\"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The letter also strongly sides with transgender students on the issue of restrooms and locker rooms, which have become a flashpoint nationwide in debates about transgender rights. In the guidance letter, schools are told not to discriminate against students who choose to use restrooms that correspond to their gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;While the letter itself does not carry legal force, it notifies teachers and administrators that discrimination against transgender students could bring sanctions, including the painful loss of federal funding.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Under the Obama administration, federal agencies have increasingly considered transgender discrimination to be a form of sex discrimination. The Education and Justice Departments &lt;a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-officials-protect-transgender-student-against-discri?utm_term=.ihjao6eB6D#.pyN1LMxGMn\"&gt;first explicitly stated&lt;/a&gt; that Title IX covers transgender discrimination in 2013, although Friday&amp;rsquo;s letter is the strongest effort yet to apply that interpretation nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The letter caps a historic week for federal protection of transgender rights. On Monday, the Justice Department &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/state-sponsored-discrimination-loretta-lynch-takes-on-north-carolinas-hb2/481986/\"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against North Carolina targeting HB2, the state&amp;rsquo;s controversial bill requiring&amp;mdash;among other things&amp;mdash;transgender individuals to use bathrooms that don&amp;rsquo;t correspond to their gender identity. In an impassioned press conference, Attorney General Loretta Lynch described the statute as &amp;ldquo;state-sponsored discrimination&amp;rdquo; and implicitly compared it to Jim Crow laws.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have been told that this law protects vulnerable populations from harm. That is just not the case,&amp;rdquo; Lynch said. &amp;ldquo;What this law does is inflict further indignity for a population that has already suffered far more than its far share. This law provides no benefit to society, and all it does is harm innocent Americans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/EJO_qa-WoZQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>Schools Are Put on Notice to Respect Transgender Rights</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/EJO_qa-WoZQ/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T23:58:07-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482646</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[In a letter sent Friday, federal officials warn local districts not to discriminate against students using restrooms.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Politics\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/transgender-bathroom-letter/482646/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Matt Ford</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/matt-ford/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt482640</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/05/RTX224EL/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"More Fallout From the Iran Sailor Incident\"\r\n            &gt;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy announced Thursday it had fired the commander of 10 U.S. sailors briefly detained by Iran in January after their ship entered Iranian territorial waters in the Persian Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Navy Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/2016/05/12/iran-farsi-island-sailors-capture-firing-rasch-meyer/84225038/\"&gt;has more&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Cmdr. Eric Rasch, who at the time of the Jan. 12 incident was the executive officer of the Coastal Riverine Squadron 3, was removed from his job by Capt. Gary Leigh, head of Coastal Riverine Group 1, for what a Navy Expeditionary Combat Command release said was &amp;ldquo;a loss of confidence&amp;rdquo; in his ability to remain in command.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Capt. Gary Leigh, commander, CRG-1, made this determination following his review of a preliminary investigation into the incident near Farsi Island in the Arabian Gulf, Jan. 12-13, involving 10 CRS-3 Sailors,&amp;quot; the release said. &amp;quot;Rasch was assigned as the executive officer of CRS-3 during this time-frame.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Cmdr. Gregory Meyer, who was commanding officer at the time of the incident, is currently with Coastal Riverine Group 1, and has been put on &amp;ldquo;administrative hold,&amp;rdquo; meaning the Navy will not transfer him out of the unit, while a high-level review of the Navy&amp;rsquo;s investigation into the incident continues, said two officials familiar with internal deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Rasch is the first officer formally disciplined for the incident. Navy investigators &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/04/07/navy-investigation-into-how-u-s-sailors-were-detained-by-iran-reaches-top-admirals/\"&gt;completed their investigation&lt;/a&gt; into what went wrong in April and forwarded their report to top Navy officials. Its findings have not yet been made public.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred on January 12, when the sailors were traveling in two small riverine craft from Bahrain to Kuwait through the Gulf. Along the way, they reportedly drifted into Iranian territorial waters, where two Iranian vessels intercepted them and detained the crew. No gunfire was exchanged.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/sailors-released/423885/\"&gt;frantic diplomatic effort&lt;/a&gt; between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammed Javad Zarif, led to the release of the sailors and their boats the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The timing proved awkward for both countries, with President Obama scheduled to give his State of the Union address on the night of the incident and Iran only days away from receiving long-awaited sanctions relief as part of the nuclear accord it struck with six world powers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/yCGsdzP8p8E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>More Fallout From the Iran Sailor Incident</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/yCGsdzP8p8E/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T20:44:50-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482640</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The U.S. Navy relieves an officer of command for his role in the January 12 detention of 10 U.S. sailors by Iranian forces.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Global\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/iran-sailor-firing-navy/482640/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>David A.

Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample, &lt;a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/trump-butler-anthony-senecal-facebook-kill-obama\"&gt;caught by &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/trump-butler-anthony-senecal-facebook-kill-obama\"&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(and apparently since deleted):&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To all my friends on FB, just a short note to you on our pus headed &amp;quot;president&amp;quot; !!!! This character who I refer to as zero (0) should have been taken out by our military and shot as an enemy agent in his first term !!!!! Instead he still remains in office doing every thing he can to gut the America we all know and love !!!!! Now comes Donald J Trump to put an end to the corruption in government !!!!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to calling for the military to stage a coup and execute Obama, he also called for lynching the president:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I feel it is time for the SECOND AMERICAN REVOLUTION !!!!! The only way we will change this crooked government is to douche it !!!!! This might be the time with this kenyan fraud in power !!!!! ...[W]ith the last breath I draw I will help rid this America of the scum infested in its government--and if that means dragging that ball less dick head from the white mosque and hanging his scrawny ass from the portico--count me in !!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/trump-butler-anthony-senecal-facebook-kill-obama\"&gt;David Corn has some more examples&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the posts have been deleted, Senecal didn&amp;rsquo;t deny them. In fact, he expanded on them to NBC&amp;rsquo;s Alex Jaffe:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"&gt;In intvu w &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajjaffe\"&gt;@ajjaffe&lt;/a&gt;, Trump&amp;#39;s butler calls for Obama to be &amp;quot;hung from the portico of the White Mosque,&amp;quot; calls Obama daughters &amp;quot;rent-a-kids&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&amp;mdash; Beth Fouhy (@bfouhy) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bfouhy/status/730845142786183170\"&gt;May 12, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;(What does &amp;ldquo;rent-a-kids&amp;rdquo; even mean?)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Senecal&amp;rsquo;s statements should inspire, in addition to a million &amp;ldquo;Clue&amp;rdquo; jokes, a few questions about Trump. The two men are close&amp;mdash;a &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;profile in March missed the racism but did capture the tightness of Senecal&amp;rsquo;s relationship with the entertainer, for whom he&amp;rsquo;s worked since 1985. (Senecal say he&amp;rsquo;s been at Mar-a-Lago since about 1959.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ol type=\"1\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who&amp;rsquo;s lying about Anthony Senecal?&lt;/strong&gt; Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign, in response to the revelation of Senecal&amp;rsquo;s Facebook posts, disavowed them and said that he had not worked for Trump for years. But Senecal told both &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;whose reporter, Jason Horowitz, roamed the grounds at Mar-a-Lago with him&amp;mdash;that he continued to work there. Senecal &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/us/politics/donald-trump-butler-mar-a-lago.html?_r=0\"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Trump specifically asked him to stay on staff as a historian-in-residence, even as he retired from butler duties. Someone&amp;rsquo;s not telling the truth, and Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign is the more obvious culprit. Which brings up the next point:&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of populist has a butler?&lt;/strong&gt; OK, this one actually isn&amp;rsquo;t that tough a question. FDR was wealthy, too! For Trump, his wealth and implausible Horatio Alger self-image make him an aspirational figure for many supporters, rather than a symbol of elitist entitlement. Still, there&amp;rsquo;s something rich (pardon the phrase) about the fact that, &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi/status/730842581899333632\"&gt;as Olivia Nuzzi put it&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Romney&amp;#39;s car elevator made him unelectable in 2012 but Trump&amp;#39;s psychotic racist butler is just another Thursday in 2016.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When exactly will Trump start hiring the best people? &lt;/strong&gt;Trump&amp;rsquo;s answer to many staffing questions is that he&amp;rsquo;ll hire the best people. It&amp;rsquo;s his answer to why his administration will work so much better than previous ones, and it&amp;rsquo;s his answer to why voters needn&amp;rsquo;t worry about his lack of experience in government, defense, foreign policy, economic policy, etc. When, precisely, does he expect to start doing that? The fact that Senecal has been such a longtime, trusted employee ought not to fill anyone with confidence. And his comments follow, for example, the saga over campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grabbing and manhandling a reporter, than lying about it despite video evidence.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did Trump manage to denounce Senecal so much faster than David Duke?&lt;/strong&gt; Remember when former KKK leader David Duke voiced his support for Trump back in February, Trump initially played dumb. &amp;ldquo;Well, just so you understand, I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about David Duke,&amp;rdquo; he told Jake Tapper. &amp;ldquo;OK? I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about what you&amp;rsquo;re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo; That was implausible&amp;mdash;he&amp;rsquo;d criticized Duke as far back as the 1990s&amp;mdash;and he of course reversed himself eventually, blaming (again, implausibly) an earpiece problem. Now comes the case of Senecal, when Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign issued a statement quickly, saying, &amp;ldquo;Tony Senecal has not worked at Mar-a-Lago for years, but nevertheless we totally and completely disavow the horrible statements made by him.&amp;rdquo; Trump noted he had never met Duke; not so with Senecal. Perhaps the faster response is evidence that Trump really is changing his approach, and pivoting toward the general election. However ...&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s up with all the racists who support Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign? &lt;/strong&gt;One needn&amp;rsquo;t accuse Trump of bigotry&amp;mdash;though there&amp;rsquo;s ample evidence to do so&amp;mdash;to be perturbed by the number of people with repellent views who are ardent Trump backers. Meanwhile, minority voters hold overwhelmingly unfavorable views of Trump, &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/the-way-donald-trump-speaks-toand-aboutminorities/481155/\"&gt;for some reason&lt;/a&gt;. Does this perturb the Trump campaign?&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Will any of this hurt Trump? Past experience says no&amp;mdash;he seems to just keep rolling, though it&amp;rsquo;s true that open white supremacy and calls for the president&amp;rsquo;s death tend to turn off even the most forbearing ally. Trump has managed to shift expectations so far that the revelation of comments such as these seem like simply the latest in a parade of inanities (which they are), rather than a shocking shift away from normal (which they also are). All in all, it&amp;rsquo;s an embarrassing situation for the Trump campaign. Senecal told the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that Trump&amp;rsquo;s mood could be reliably gauged by the color of his hat&amp;mdash;red meaning ornery, white meaning pleasant. It&amp;rsquo;s a good bet that Trump will be donning the red cap this evening.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/n6Ylrjwpt0E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>Five Questions About Donald Trump's Racist Butler</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/n6Ylrjwpt0E/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T19:15:38-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482604</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The longtime Mar-a-Lago staffer called for a military coup and the lynching of President Obama.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Politics\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/five-questions-about-donald-trumps-racist-butler/482604/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Marina Koren</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/marina-koren/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt482571</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/05/RTR35FK6/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"Kenya\u2019s Anti-Doping Crisis\"\r\n            &gt;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The world&amp;rsquo;s anti-doping authority has declared that Kenyan national athletics do not comply with international standards, putting the country&amp;rsquo;s participation in the Rio Olympics this summer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The World Anti-Doping Agency announced the recommendation from its independent review committee Thursday afternoon on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WADA?src=hash\"&gt;#WADA&lt;/a&gt; CRC has made the unanimous recommendation that &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kenya?src=hash\"&gt;#Kenya&lt;/a&gt; be declared non-compliant with immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&amp;mdash; WADA (@wada_ama) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/wada_ama/status/730791681503731712\"&gt;May 12, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"&gt;The CRC cites issues with &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kenya?src=hash\"&gt;#Kenya&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s legislation which it says is not in line with the World Anti-Doping Code.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&amp;mdash; WADA (@wada_ama) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/wada_ama/status/730791938702639106\"&gt;May 12, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The legislation WADA cites was approved last month. Facing pressure from WADA to crack down on cheating in sports, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta signed an anti-doping bill that created a national agency that would fine and imprison athletes who are found to be guilty of doping, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/36087174\"&gt;according to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The committee&amp;rsquo;s recommendation must be ratified by WADA&amp;rsquo;s board, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/12/kenya-olympic-doubt-wada-non-compliant\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The decision to ban Kenya from participating in the summer games is up to the International Olympic Committee.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the global governing body for athletics, &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/17/iaaf-kenya-investigation-doping-allegations\"&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; doping allegations in Kenya last year. Dick Pound, the former president of WADA and chair of its independent committee, &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/17/kenya-doping-problem-dick-pound-concern\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in November that it is &amp;ldquo;pretty clear that there is a lot of performance-enhancing drugs being used&amp;rdquo; in Kenya. Pound led the investigation of Russian athletics that in November &lt;a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-athletics-corruption-idUSKCN0SY1NG20151109\"&gt;alleged&lt;/a&gt; widespread doping by athletes and corruption among officials. In response, the IAAF &lt;a href=\"http://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/iaaf-araf-suspended\"&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; Russia&amp;rsquo;s membership in the association. WADA officials were sent Russia to &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/05/olympic-games-russia-rio-dick-pound-wada-president\"&gt;overhaul its anti-doping practices&lt;/a&gt; in time for Rio, and IAAF will decide on Russia&amp;rsquo;s membership in June.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Runner&amp;rsquo;s World&lt;/em&gt; detailed last year the reports of alleged cheating among Russian and Kenyan athletes:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Between 2001 and 2012, some 146 Olympic and world championships medalists in &lt;a href=\"http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/mens-running-shoes/7puZ8yzZoi3?ipp=112\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; and walking events 800 meters and longer had blood test results that were grounds for suspicion of &lt;a href=\"http://www.runnersworld.com/tag/performance-enhancing-drugs\"&gt;performance-enhancing drug use&lt;/a&gt;, according to German TV station &lt;a href=\"http://www.daserste.de/information/reportage-dokumentation/dokus/videos/geheimsache-doping-engl-version-100.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;ARD&amp;rsquo;s new documentary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Doping&amp;ndash;Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics&lt;/em&gt;, and simultaneous reporting &lt;a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/thedopingscandal/article1588373.ece\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;by the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fifty-five of those said to have suspicious blood results were gold medalists. More than 80 of the suspicious medals were won by Russians, and 18 were won by Kenyans. In a 5,000-athlete database maintained by the International Association of Athletics Federations, 800 were judged by two Australia-based experts to have blood values that suggested illegal drug use, mainly indicative of the blood booster EPO.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Kenyan athletes &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/2012/medals/countries/kenya/sports/athletics\"&gt;won&lt;/a&gt; 11 medals in the 2012 Olympic Games in London, nearly all in track events.

The &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/04/daredevil/390294/\"&gt;comic-book show&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/23/9186237/bojack-horseman-netflix-interview\"&gt;grownup cartoon&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt-returns-more-madcap-than-ever/478476/\"&gt;network sitcom&lt;/a&gt; have all found surprising new angles thanks to the streaming service. But its new offering &lt;em&gt;Chelsea&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;hosted by Chelsea Handler&amp;mdash;is tackling an even steeper challenge: turning the late-night talk show, the most staid, old-school television format around, into something fresh and exciting. The series makes a noble effort, but from the look of its first episodes, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet figured out a way to stand out from its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Handler is a veteran at the talk-show game, and her long-running series on E!, &lt;em&gt;Chelsea Lately&lt;/em&gt;, was more anarchic than her network-TV rivals, with its permanent roundtable of L.A. comedians riffing on pop culture and reality TV. Her Netflix series, which will release episodes every Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, applies that freewheeling conversational style to more serious topics&amp;mdash;education reform, tech innovation&amp;mdash;while retaining some of the medium&amp;rsquo;s classic formatting. But more often than not, the combination is awkward rather than transformative.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is Handler&amp;rsquo;s insistence that she&amp;rsquo;s doing something radically different. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do a monologue anymore,&amp;rdquo; she said in the first episode&amp;rsquo;s monologue, delivered to a laughing audience. &amp;ldquo;I know it seems like a monologue, but this is not a monologue. It&amp;rsquo;s an explanation. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t know the difference, then you can log out, or log off, or fuck off, or whatever ... I&amp;rsquo;m a late-show host that doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be tied down by time, or television, or even hosting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;d make more sense if &lt;em&gt;Chelsea &lt;/em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like such a classic late show, through and through. After her opening monologue, which disses the idea of an opening monologue, Handler transfers to a desk and makes a few jokes about the upcoming election, before cutting to a pre-taped sketch poking gentle fun at her new network. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing here viewers haven&amp;rsquo;t seen before&amp;mdash;but that&amp;rsquo;s not entirely Handler&amp;rsquo;s fault. The late-night talk show really only hinges on two things: It airs late at night, and its stars and guests talk about current events, be they frivolous or weighty. What&amp;rsquo;s there to revolutionize?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chelsea &lt;/em&gt;feels like a classic late-night show, through and through.&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;As with many Netflix shows, the biggest difference the viewer might immediately notice in &lt;em&gt;Chelsea &lt;/em&gt;is the lack of ad breaks. With network shows, commercial breaks have come to inform the structure of each episode: They demand that a guest fit an anecdote into six minutes, or that the viewer sit through five ad breaks before watching the musical performance or stand-up set they might have tuned in for. Not so with &lt;em&gt;Chelsea&lt;/em&gt;. Bored by the opening sketch, but interested in Handler&amp;rsquo;s discussion with Education Secretary John King? Just skip ahead to that. If a panel runs a little longer than expected, the show can keep it all in, since running times don&amp;rsquo;t matter much (episode one is 37 minutes long, episode two is 33). Meanwhile, even premium-cable talk shows like HBO&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Last Week Tonight&lt;/em&gt;, which also don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about ads, still have to fit within a half-hour block.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chelsea &lt;/em&gt;is also notable for its &amp;ldquo;near-live&amp;rdquo; status (it records the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of each week it airs), while all other network talk shows, from Stephen Colbert to Jimmy Fallon to Trevor Noah, tape hours before they air. Since joining Netflix, Handler &lt;a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/chelsea-handler-rips-e-tv-experience-1201436471/\"&gt;has talked&lt;/a&gt; about how bored she got with the demands of her E! show and the necessity of discussing the latest life updates of reality stars and hot items from gossip blogs. She envisions &lt;em&gt;Chelsea &lt;/em&gt;as &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; but &amp;ldquo;faster and cooler,&amp;rdquo; and the first two episodes of the show try to accomplish that by throwing wonks like King or TED Talks founder Chris Anderson together with celebrities like Drew Barrymore and Gwyneth Paltrow. It provokes some insightful moments&amp;mdash;and some wince-inducing ones, like Handler&amp;rsquo;s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;attempt to freestyle rap with Pitbull minutes after he tearfully talked about the educators who had an impact on his adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Late night has strict formatting for a reason: The whiplash between straightforward comedy and insightful, honest interviews can otherwise be too much for audiences. Still, few talk shows know from the start how to nail the tone they&amp;rsquo;re aiming for. Fortunately, Handler has time to figure that out&amp;mdash;the show will air 90 episodes this year, three per week, throwing together eclectic groups of guests. &lt;em&gt;Chelsea&lt;/em&gt; may be off to a shaky start, but for those who want to wait for the show to find its feet before checking out some episodes, there should be an interesting backlog of segments in a few weeks. It might not exactly overhaul the late-night format, but few shows are in a better position to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/K6c5NqSN1QU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>Can Chelsea Handler Break the Late-Night Format? </title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/K6c5NqSN1QU/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T15:17:00-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482550</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The comedian&rsquo;s new Netflix show has a &lsquo;near-live&rsquo; recording schedule and an eclectic mix of guests.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Culture\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/can-chelsea-handler-break-the-late-night-format/482550/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Spencer Kornhaber</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/spencer-kornhaber/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt482484</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/05/AP_40947945865/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"Ding Dong, Azealia Banks Is off Twitter\"\r\n            &gt;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Even the biggest fans of the rapper Azealia Banks&amp;rsquo;s music&amp;mdash;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/03/azealia-banks-slay-z-donald-trump-review/475707/\"&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d count myself among them&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;have to admit, by now, that her larger ongoing cultural significance stems from her tweets rather than her music. At a time when sensitivity&amp;mdash;or &amp;ldquo;political correctness&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;is a hot topic, Banks has played the unique role of reminding people that there&amp;rsquo;s no partisan monopoly on hatefulness. She supports Trump but also parts of far-left ideology; she&amp;rsquo;s flung hate speech at nearly every identity group imaginable, with her latest flare-up slurring the singer Zayn Malik for being Pakistani and the actress Skai Jackson for being young. This time, the results are that she&amp;rsquo;s been dropped from a U.K. music festival and&amp;mdash;this is big, though possibly coincidentally timed&amp;mdash;suspended from Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;It feels like satire come to life that her long-awaited reckoning would come only after insulting an insanely popular ex-boy-bander like Malik. The racism and homophobia on display wasn&amp;rsquo;t new for her; the lesson would seem to be that the one group you never want to offend is One Direction fans. If you want to find a deeper lesson, though, you can: Banks&amp;rsquo;s final (for now) Twitter tirade was a perfectly incoherent masterclass in showing how we end up with so many people spewing hate speech at strangers online.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The incident began with Banks posting a side-by-side comparison on Instagram of Malik&amp;rsquo;s new music video with an old one of hers. The point was that he was jacking her aesthetic, though the picture of skinny shirtless Malik next to Banks in a bra seemed like a wink that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t being all that serious. Ditto for &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFO6qsqn1by/?taken-by=azealiabanks&amp;amp;hl=en\"&gt;the caption&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not mad about this though. Zayn is a cutie pie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Soon after, Malik tweeted &amp;ldquo;I see you reaching but I don&amp;rsquo;t care&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;My @&amp;rsquo;s too good for you.&amp;rdquo; He might have been referring to Banks but he might not have been. She assumed he was, replying, &amp;ldquo;dude, I make better music than you. Simmer down with that fake white boy rebellion and that wannabe beiber swag.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;She reached for the cruelest weapon available.&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;From there, she underwent a pretty dramatic devolution. The next tweet called him a &amp;ldquo;curry scented bitch,&amp;rdquo; leading the online Desi community to quickly turned #curryscentedbitch into &lt;a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/sahilrizwan/curry-scented-post\"&gt;a pride slogan&lt;/a&gt;. The one after: &amp;ldquo;imma start calling you punjab you dirty bitch.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Imma start&amp;mdash;&lt;/em&gt;in other words, she&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to go there. She&amp;rsquo;s reaching for the cruelest weapon available. Unvarnished racism blended with attempts at a wider critique as her tweets lectured him that he&amp;rsquo;d only ever been a token in One Direction: &amp;ldquo;Do you understand that you are a sand nigger who emulates white boys&amp;rsquo; renditions of black male hood?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;She later posted a textbook non-apology for her freakout&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Remember that offense is never given, it is only taken. I apologize to everyone who TOOK offense.&amp;rdquo; More interesting was her &lt;a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/azealia-banks-was-trying-to-remind-zayn-hes-poc.html\"&gt;longer explanation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I said what I said to Zayn because I was angry. He felt as if he was too good to acknowledge me yet not too good to copy my creativity. I had to remind him that we&amp;rsquo;re both in the same boat in this industry and people of color by reminding him that no matter what you may think of yourself, the world still sees you as &amp;ldquo;other,&amp;rdquo; as they see me.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have made sense if she hadn&amp;rsquo;t been the one employing disgusting slurs in exactly the way that the racists she was supposedly exposing might use them. The first two lines, suggesting she turned to hate speech out of anger and powerlessness, seems like as good an explanation as anyone is going to get for what leads someone to send so many mixed (and horrifying) messages over the years. Twitter has made it easy for her and others to air their ugliest feelings with the ugliest words possible; it hasn&amp;rsquo;t ever seemed to make those feelings go away. For now it&amp;rsquo;s doing the next best thing, which is taking her words offline.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/2_aN2Wa2j-4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>Ding Dong, Azealia Banks Is off Twitter</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/2_aN2Wa2j-4/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T14:24:00-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482484</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The controversial rapper&rsquo;s final (for now) racist freakout exemplifies the worst Internet behavior.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Culture\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/azealia-banks-twitter-suspension-zayn-malik/482484/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Marina Koren</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/marina-koren/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt482289</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/05/RTX287ZG/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"Who Is Left at Guantanamo?\"\r\n            &gt;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;On January 20, 2016, Mohammed Ali Abdullah Bwazir stood with shackles on his ankles, wrists, and waist at the bottom of a ramp leading up to a U.S. Air Force cargo plane. The plane was going to take him, along with two other Guantanamo Bay prisoners, to an undisclosed southern European nation. Bwazir, who is either 35 or 36 and is from Yemen, had been cleared for release after spending 14 years in the U.S. prison in Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;He refused to get on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t angry. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t acting out. He was very calm,&amp;rdquo; Army Colonel David Heath, the Guantanamo prison warden, later &lt;a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/article59826521.html\"&gt;recalled&lt;/a&gt; to Carol Rosenberg, the &lt;em&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who has been covering the prison since it first opened. Bwazir&amp;rsquo;s lawyer, John Chandler, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/us/politics/guantanamo-detainee-refuses-release-offer.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; the man was depressed and feared living in a country where he had no family. Bwazir wanted to go to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, or Indonesia, where he has a mother, brothers, uncles, and aunts. Faced instead with a new life in Europe, he chose to return to his cell.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Bwazir&amp;rsquo;s case highlights the complexities of emptying the prison opened after 9/11 to house dangerous terrorism suspects. The potential release of its captives carries a host of legal, political, and diplomatic implications. They illustrate why two presidents have been unsuccessful in closing the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, despite criticism of the treatment, including waterboarding, that some of the inmates underwent.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;About 780 inmates have been held at Guantanamo since it opened in 2002. Today, 80 remain.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Most have not been charged with any crimes, according to &lt;a href=\"http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo\"&gt;a comprehensive database&lt;/a&gt; maintained by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. All are men, mostly in their 30s and 40s. The youngest is about 30 or 31; the oldest is 68. Most have been there for more than 13 or 14 years. Some have gone on hunger strikes and were force-fed with liquid nutrients through nasal tubes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The inmates come from 17 countries and the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Palestinian&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;territories. The majority of inmates&amp;mdash;43&amp;mdash;are from Yemen. Eight are from Afghanistan, and six each from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The rest are from Tajikistan, Tunisia, Iraq, Algeria, Indonesia, Kenya, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, Russia, and Somalia. One inmate&amp;rsquo;s native country is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;At least 26 inmates, including Bwazir, have been cleared for release; a review board system President&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Obama created by executive order in 2011 has determined they no longer pose a security threat to the United States. This week, the board &lt;a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article76578262.html\"&gt;cleared&lt;/a&gt; for release&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Salem Ahmed Hadi, a suspected jihadist who left Yemen for Afghanistan before 9/11 and arrived at Guantanamo in its second week of existence. It was his fifth time before the board, which had previously rejected releasing him.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;At least 43 inmates are being held indefinitely and have not been recommended for release by the review boards. These indefinite detainees are known as the &amp;ldquo;forever prisoners,&amp;rdquo; the captives deemed too dangerous to release but who have not been charged with any crimes. Indefinite detention without trial is illegal under the Geneva Conventions, but the Bush administration &lt;a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/today/2013/gitmo-the-legal-mess-behind-the-ethical-mess/\"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that international laws did not apply to the &amp;ldquo;unlawful enemy combatants&amp;rdquo; who were taken to Guantanamo.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Seven inmates have been &lt;a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article2163210.html\"&gt;charged with war crimes&lt;/a&gt; in Guantanamo&amp;rsquo;s military commissions, the judicial system set up by the Bush administration and tweaked by the Obama administration. They include Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the alleged organizer of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and his four alleged co-conspirators. The others are Abd al Rahim al-Nashiri, a Saudi detainee charged for allegedly organizing the bombing of a U.S. Navy destroyer in Yemen in 2000 that killed 17 sailors, and Abd al Hadi al Iraqi, an Iraqi detainee who allegedly led al-Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s military operations from 2002 to 2004.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Three inmates have been convicted of war crimes, but the conviction of one was overturned on appeal. Majid Khan, a Pakistani native who once lived in Baltimore, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/guantanamo-detainee-majid-khan-pleads-guilty-promises-cooperation/2012/02/29/gIQAVuIaiR_story.html\"&gt;pleaded guilty&lt;/a&gt; to war crimes in 2012, acknowledging he returned to Pakistan after 9/11 to work for Khalid Sheik Mohammed. &lt;a href=\"http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/768-ahmed-muhammed-haza-al-darbi\"&gt;Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi&lt;/a&gt;, a Saudi citizen, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/us/guantanamo-detainee-ahmed-muhammed-haza-al-darbi.html\"&gt;pleaded guilty&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 over the 2002 al-Qaeda attack on a French oil tanker off the coast of Yemen. Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman al-Bahlul, a Saudi citizen accused of being Osama bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;media secretary,&amp;rdquo; was &lt;a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/05/ali-hamza-ahmad-suliman-al-bahlul\"&gt;convicted&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 of conspiracy, terrorism-related charges,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and other charges. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned his conviction in 2013, saying the crimes of which he&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was convicted were not recognized as war crimes at the time he committed them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The White House&amp;rsquo;s push to shutter Guantanamo for good began a decade ago. In May 2006, President George W. Bush &lt;a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bush-says-he-wants-to-close-guantanamo/\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he wanted to close the detention center. Two years later, Obama made the closure of the prison one of his campaign promises. In his first days in office, Obama &lt;a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-upends-bush-will-close-guantanamo/\"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an executive order to close the prison within a year. He has since vowed to shut it down before he leaves office.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The Bush administration released about &lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/02/AR2010020203883.html\"&gt;540 detainees&lt;/a&gt; without charge. The Obama administration has released &lt;a href=\"http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/facts-about-transfer-guantanamo-detainees\"&gt;158&lt;/a&gt;. Detainees have gone to countries willing to accept them, &lt;a href=\"http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/transfer-countries\"&gt;58 nations&lt;/a&gt; in all, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; database. Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia have accepted the most at 203 and 134, respectively. Pakistan has accepted 63. Five Taliban detainees were released in the swap that freed Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl from five years of captivity in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Nations on six continents have accepted Guantanamo&amp;rsquo;s prisoners. Nine have died in the camp, five of them by suicide, according to U.S. officials.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Detainees do not choose where they are released. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not a travel agency,&amp;rdquo; Lee Wolosky, the State Department&amp;rsquo;s special envoy for the Guantanamo closure, &lt;a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/article59826521.html\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Rosenberg, after Bwazir asked to be taken back to his cell earlier this year. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not here to fulfill every wish and desire of a resettlee.&amp;rdquo; The U.S. no longer transfers detainees to Yemen because of the worsening political and security climates and an active a-Qaeda affiliate in the country. U.S. law restricts transfers to countries whose security situations are considered unstable, including Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia. In February, Saudi Arabia &lt;a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/16/9-gitmo-detainees-sent-saudi-arabia-80-prisoners-remain/83127414/\"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to accept non-citizens from Guantanamo for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Since 2009, Obama has sought to transfer detainees to detention facilities in the U.S. But congressional Republicans have repeatedly blocked those attempts, passing legislation that &lt;a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-ndaa-closing-guantanamo_56421b7ee4b0307f2caf060e\"&gt;prohibits&lt;/a&gt; the use of government funds to transfer prisoners to American soil and the construction of facilities to house them. Only two detainees have been transferred to the United States: Yaser Esam Hamdi, in April 2002, and Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani in June 2009. Hamdi, who is a citizen of both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and was born in Louisiana, was held at a naval brig in Charleston, South Carolina, until October 2004 when he was &lt;a href=\"http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/9-yaser-esam-hamdi\"&gt;repatriated&lt;/a&gt; to Saudi Arabia. Ghailani, a Tanzanian, was &lt;a href=\"http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10012-ahmed-khalfan-ghailani\"&gt;transferred&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. in 2009 and remains at the federal super-maximum security prison in Fremont, Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In February, the administration, in a final proposal to Congress for Guantanamo&amp;rsquo;s closure, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guantanamo-costs-idUSKCN0VW1NB\"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; sending detainees to 13 potential sites on U.S. soil but did not identify the facilities. Last year, Pentagon officials &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/10/guantanamo-bay-colorado/410296/\"&gt;surveyed&lt;/a&gt; potential candidates, visiting federal prisons in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and Charleston, South Carolina, as well as state and federal facilities in Florence, Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Opponents of closing Guantanamo argue detainees return to terrorist activity when released. Top Republican lawmakers and foreign-policy hawks, including Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, say 30 percent of freed detainees become terrorists. Bu Congress-mandated reports from the administration&amp;rsquo;s intelligence officials &lt;a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/15/john-mccain/mccain-30-past-guantanamo-detainees-re-enter-fight/\"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; the rate of confirmed recidivism is about 17 percent. Obama has said Guantanamo serves as a &amp;ldquo;recruiting tool&amp;rdquo; for other extremist militant groups, like the Islamic State, but experts who study jihadist propaganda say the camp is &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/02/is-guantanamo-a-terrorist-recruitment-tool/470640/\"&gt;not featured prominently in jihadist materials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The first 20 prisoners of Guantanamo Bay &lt;a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/01/11/ret.detainee.transfer/index.html\"&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in Cuba on January 11, 2002. In the short months after Bush declared a war on terrorism, the U.S. military had captured 45 fighters from al-Qaeda and the Taliban in the Middle East, and it needed a place to put them. Officials ruled out Guam after its citizens raised concerns about the presence of terrorism suspects, and settled on the U.S. naval base on Cuba&amp;rsquo;s southeastern tip&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;the least worst place we could have selected,&amp;rdquo; as former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/28/us/nation-challenged-detention-camp-us-hold-taliban-detainees-least-worst-place.html\"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; it. Back then, the base was capable of housing 100 detainees, and the first captives were held in the steel-and-wire cages as the detention center was expanded.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;More than a decade later, the sprawling camp has enough facilities to house hundreds of prisoners. Military personnel vastly outnumber captives. The annual cost to taxpayers of maintaining the camp was &lt;a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/infographic/wasted-opportunities-cost-detention-operations-guantanamo-bay\"&gt;$454 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-guantanamo-hearings-factbox-idUSN1148106920080411\"&gt;last known arrival&lt;/a&gt; to the prison was Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani in 2008, an Afghan described as a high-level al-Qaeda operative. The latest release was in April of this year, when nine Yemeni prisoners were &lt;a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guantanamo-idUSKCN0XD0ZU\"&gt;transferred&lt;/a&gt; to Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In 2013, Rosenberg, the &lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt; reporter, &lt;a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/2013/miami-herald-reporter-covers-guantanamo-bay-for-12-years-with-no-end-in-sight/214562/\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Poynter she was assigned to report the Guantanamo story &amp;ldquo;start to finish.&amp;rdquo; She doesn&amp;rsquo;t expect Obama to meet his self-imposed deadline. &amp;ldquo;I thought it would be closed when Obama was elected, but as it stands, it could be that we will just be waiting for the last guy to die before it closes,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/kWGoC0h5l7s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>Who Is Left at Guantanamo?</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/kWGoC0h5l7s/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T14:02:28-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482289</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[And who can never leave?]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Politics\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/guanatanamo-bay-forever-prisoners/482289/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>David Sims</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/david-sims/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt482481</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/05/AP_862455447932/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"The Growing Divide Between &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Game of Thrones&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and George R.R.

Martin&amp;rsquo;s long-gestating novel &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt;, released on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.georgerrmartin.com/excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter/\"&gt;author&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, is typically tantalizing material. Like the rest his &lt;em&gt;Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; series, it&amp;rsquo;s told entirely from the point of view of a specific character&amp;mdash;this time Princess Arianne Martell, the heiress to the kingdom of Dorne, as she ponders a new challenger to the Iron Throne of Westeros. It adds more context to two crucial stories and lends further depth to one of Martin&amp;rsquo;s most dynamic female characters. It also has nothing to do with the hit HBO series that the novels inspired.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones,&lt;/em&gt; currently in its sixth season, has largely diverged from Martin&amp;rsquo;s books, telling stories past their current end point in the completed novels as the annual demands of TV production outpace the author&amp;rsquo;s decades-long writing process. Fans have worried that the show, which creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have said will probably end after &lt;a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/game-of-thrones-end-date-season-8-1201752746/\"&gt;two more truncated seasons&lt;/a&gt;, will spoil Martin&amp;rsquo;s grand conclusion. But as every chapter released from &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter &lt;/em&gt;shows, including this latest check-in with Arianne, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to fear. Martin is telling tales of characters the show&amp;rsquo;s viewers will never meet, on quests that will never make it to the screen. And the show is actually beginning to work toward an ending, which leaves Martin free to do something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fans have also long accepted that &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;will finish before every chapter of &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire &lt;/em&gt;hits bookstores. Even if Martin had finished &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter &lt;/em&gt;last year as he intended, he would have had to turn around the seventh and supposedly final entry within a year or two to beat the show. He hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked at that pace in a long time: The shortest turnaround between books was just under two years between the second and third novels in the series, and the last entry came out in 2011, the year &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;premiered. But when &lt;a href=\"http://grrm.livejournal.com/465247.html\"&gt;Martin announced&lt;/a&gt; to fans that &lt;em&gt;Winds of Winter &lt;/em&gt;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be done in time for season six of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, he tried to reassure readers. &amp;ldquo;Some of the &amp;lsquo;spoilers&amp;rsquo; you may encounter in season six may not be spoilers at all ... because the show and the books have diverged, and will continue to do so,&amp;rdquo; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The new Arianne chapter, which Martin has read aloud at fan conventions, is a perfect example of that divergence, coming at an opportune moment since the show has begun killing pivotal characters. Arianne, the heiress of Dorne, isn&amp;rsquo;t a character in the show at all&amp;mdash;she was replaced by a male heir, Trystane, a minor character in the books. His elevation &lt;a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/07/29/game-of-thrones-arianna-martell/#fD4ENjaGYaq8\"&gt;sparked outcry&lt;/a&gt; from fans who thought the show was losing a compelling female leader, but in Martin&amp;rsquo;s pages she endures, negotiating the future of her kingdom and reckoning with a new contender to the throne.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;That character, the pretender Aegon Targaryen, also isn&amp;rsquo;t in the show. Neither is his companion Jon Connington, who&amp;rsquo;s discussed extensively in the new chapter. Martin has also released chapters about Stannis Baratheon and Barristan Selmy (both killed off by HBO last season), and Victarion Greyjoy (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist on the show and likely never will). As the show came closer to overtaking Martin&amp;rsquo;s books, he made more and more references to the &amp;ldquo;butterfly effect&amp;rdquo; of TV plotting, where &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s attempts to simplify the grander story arc would only lead to bigger differences between the books and show. What first felt like a cop-out now feels on point: Readers are no longer worried the show&amp;rsquo;s going to spoil the novels, just that it&amp;rsquo;ll move forward clumsily with its adaptation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;Martin is telling tales of characters show viewers will never meet, on quests that will never make it to the screen.&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a semi-humorous &lt;a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1833467562/fixing-dorne\"&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt; to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; the show&amp;rsquo;s Dorne plotline, which was largely dispatched in the opening episode of this season. In Martin&amp;rsquo;s books, Dorne is a powerful sector of Westeros under the rule of the infirm but wise Prince Doran, who&amp;rsquo;s scheming to position his children for greatness as the realm falls into chaos. On the show, Doran was an ineffectual fool, eventually betrayed and murdered by his brother&amp;rsquo;s paramour. His death scene, and the subsequent murder of his son, felt like Benioff and Weiss washing their hands of a plotline they never quite knew how to weave into the larger story. The Kickstarter campaign says it needs $20 million to replicate the show&amp;rsquo;s style and production value and shoot enough material to paper over the problem areas. The campaign&amp;rsquo;s creators probably aren&amp;rsquo;t going to make it (currently, backers have pledged almost $24,000), but their project captures just how strongly many readers feel about the show&amp;rsquo;s new direction.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;For all the complaints from hardcore fans, Benioff and Weiss are working with admirable intent this year, and they&amp;rsquo;re wise to point &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;toward an ending. Dorne may be an intriguing location in the books, but it never worked for the show, so it had to go. Characters like Stannis, Barristan, Roose Bolton, and others were compelling figures who weren&amp;rsquo;t indispensable to the show&amp;rsquo;s outcome, so it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise they were all killed off in typically bloody HBO fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Martin, on the other hand, may never even finish his grand opus. When he began writing &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire &lt;/em&gt;in 1991, it was planned &lt;a href=\"http://winteriscoming.net/2015/02/05/george-rr-martin-original-game-of-thrones-pitch/\"&gt;as three books&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth book turned into a volume of unpublishable length and was split into two, taking over a decade to be released. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2011/07/22/fantasy-king/3\"&gt;Martin still swears&lt;/a&gt; there are only two more entries left in the series. His plot meanderings across his fictional continents may frustrate some readers, but the approach is also why so many were drawn to the detailed world he created in the first place. For fans dissatisfied with the show&amp;rsquo;s pared-down move toward an endgame, there&amp;rsquo;ll be no shortage of richness in the books to come&amp;mdash;as long as they don&amp;rsquo;t mind waiting several more years.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/S31pEBFPrRg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>The Growing Divide Between &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and George R.R.

Both women requested the jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Corps applauds the time and efforts of those Marines who volunteered,&amp;rdquo; said Captain Philip Kulczewski, a Marine spokesman at the Pentagon. More from &lt;em&gt;The Military Times:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Since no women have graduated from the service&amp;rsquo;s Infantry Officer Course, female Marine or Navy officers assigned to infantry battalions will serve in support roles. The 30th female Marine to attempt IOC left her class on April 21 after she was unable to complete two hikes. She has the opportunity to attempt the course again in July.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Marines did not release the women&amp;rsquo;s names. Under the service&amp;rsquo;s gender-integration policy, two female officers will be assigned to the infantry unit 90 days before its new members arrive. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/12/women-in-the-military/418680/\"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in December it would open all combat jobs in every branch of the armed forces to women starting this year. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;ll be able to serve as Army Rangers and Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers, and everything else that was previously open only to men,&amp;rdquo; U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Carter &lt;a href=\"http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/story/military/2016/04/15/first-female-marine-applies-join-infantry/83073068/\"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the Marine Corps&amp;rsquo; gender integration plan in March, making 233 women who graduated from infantry training and other military occupational-specialty schools eligible to apply for combat jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military will see several firsts for female service members this year. The Army &lt;a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/15/army-women-new-rules-infantry-armor-officers/83036812/\"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last month that 22 women would be commissioned as infantry and armor officers for the first time. A female staff sergeant will &lt;a href=\"http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/story/military/2016/03/28/female-admin-marine-attempt-marsoc-training-summer/82347390/\"&gt;attempt&lt;/a&gt; the six-week course of the Marine Corps&amp;rsquo;s special-operations command this summer; if she completes training, she could become the first female critical-skills operator. The Navy has begun collecting applications for SEAL training from men and women, but &lt;a href=\"http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/2016/04/19/navy-seals-now-open-women-but-none-has-stepped-forward/82982558/\"&gt;no women have applied&lt;/a&gt; as of this month.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Related Video&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" src=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/video/iframe/423600/\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"caption\"&gt;Long before the Pentagon&amp;#39;s announcement, women were already embedded in the front lines of Afghanistan.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/AKFVZ3LPpUo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>The First Infantry Women of the U.S. Marines </title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/AKFVZ3LPpUo/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T11:43:53-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482520</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The Corps has approved two women for roles previously open only to men.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"U.S.\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/05/women-marines-combat/482520/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Brentin Mock</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/brentin-mock/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt482424</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/05/harriet/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"Harriet Tubman Was My Wonder Woman\"\r\n            &gt;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to say my 12-year-old son Justice was enjoying every second of the American history lesson my wife and I were giving him. It was Independence Day weekend last summer, and we were driving up Jefferson Davis Highway from Richmond, Virginia. I pointed out the &lt;a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/07/why-memorializing-americas-history-of-racism-matters/397781/\"&gt;Confederate road markers along the way&lt;/a&gt; to teach my son about the Civil War. My wife and I took turns Googling the names and landmarks mentioned on the monuments and summarizing out loud. Justice was also on his iPhone, but not paying us much attention&amp;mdash;I could tell by the way his fingers kept rapidly tapping the touchscreen that he was playing one of his games. I even tried the very Dad approach of using pop-culture references to grab his attention&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;So Justice, this spot over here was like the Confederate Army&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;no flex zone&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;you know, like Rae Sremmurd?&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"special-report\"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;For a second, though, I thought perhaps it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my corny presentation that was turning Justice off, but rather the macabre details about war and slavery. But he disabused me of the notion when I brought it up&amp;mdash;he didn&amp;rsquo;t feel threatened, likely because the reality of growing up black in America today is in many ways much scarier&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;than the tales of rebel generals of yesteryear. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say the stories of the ghosts of Confederate militants and Klan vigilantes aren&amp;rsquo;t also haunting, or disturbing, in their own right. Despite my brief misgivings, I&amp;rsquo;d never hesitated before then when it came to sharing the ugliness of America&amp;rsquo;s racial history with my son. That&amp;rsquo;s probably because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t spooked by these kinds of stories growing up, just as my parents hadn&amp;rsquo;t been unnerved about exposing me to them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;One of the ways they introduced me to these stories was through comic books, though not the kind my son reads today. The comics of my youth weren&amp;rsquo;t from the DC or Marvel universes: The first graphic novels I ever encountered were about black figures from history, courtesy of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=346671\"&gt;Golden Legacy comics&lt;/a&gt; first published by Bertram A. Fitzgerald, Jr. in the 1960s and &amp;rsquo;70s. None of my peers or friends got the same introduction to comics I did, but my parents were pretty mindful about the media I consumed as a child. I guess they figured if I were going to lay eyes on storyboards filled with graphic violence, they might as well have been about black history, which itself has no shortage of savagery.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I was probably in the 4th grade when my mother started bringing the books home from a five-and-dime store in the city. Each Golden Legacy comic was basically an animated biography of figures such as the early D.C. urban planner &lt;a href=\"http://golden-legacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vol04.jpg\"&gt;Benjamin Banneker&lt;/a&gt; and the arctic explorer &lt;a href=\"http://golden-legacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vol05.jpg\"&gt;Matthew Henson&lt;/a&gt;. (I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I read the whole series.) At risk of sounding all &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley_High\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coolie Hotep High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s thanks to those books that the first comic superheroes I ever knew were Crispus Attucks, Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglass.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, I knew who Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman were, though mostly from cartoons. Those narratives were cool, but not one scene from any of their story arcs resonated with me like the scene from Golden Legacy&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Saga of Harriet Tubman &amp;ldquo;The Moses of Her People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; where a slave-master struck Tubman in the head with an iron weight. The illustrations weren&amp;rsquo;t super pulpy, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t skimp on the violence either. The artist was able to convey in that scene just how painful the iron blast was: The nasty gash it left on her face made me wince like nothing from Superman did.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yet the artist also illustrated the narrative in a way that subtly suggested the crushing blow somehow knocked supernatural powers into Tubman that allowed her to envision things many of her enslaved loved ones couldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;mdash;like freedom. In my mind, those scenes were like the spider bite to Peter Parker. As Tubman led group after group of enslaved black people through the Underground Railroad to liberation at the end of the book, she became the only Wonder Woman that made sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;The first comic superheroes I ever knew were Crispus Attucks, Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglass.&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to read anything about slavery that didn&amp;rsquo;t feature Tubman&amp;rsquo;s heroic triumphs. The Golden Legacy comic &lt;em&gt;Crispus Attucks and the Minutemen&lt;/em&gt; had the same effect on me, with its portrayal of how the Revolutionary War jumped off with a black man and his clan at the front. And after I&amp;rsquo;d read the two-part Golden Legacy series on Frederick Douglass, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell me I didn&amp;rsquo;t know everything that I needed to know about the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;But, of course, there was much more for me to learn; the Golden Legacy comic books were only my entry point into a deeper well of knowledge. My father, an avid reader, stacked plenty of books about black history around the house that I was more than happy to gormandize as I grew older. These works were filled with the thoughts and ideas of black men like Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, and John Henrik Clarke&amp;mdash;all of them looking to correct the historical doctrines that sought to paint slavery as an otherwise benign and painless institution. The racial-violence quotient in this literature was far beyond anything I read or saw in the Golden Legacy stories.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In a recent conversation, my father told me he wasn&amp;rsquo;t really ever worried about my young exposure to such weighty and morbid accounts of racism. Having grown up without his own father around, he said, he thought it was important that I rummage through those books to understand &amp;ldquo;the lay of the land&amp;rdquo; so I could raise questions about what I learned. &amp;ldquo;Whatever you were exploring back then, if you came to me, I welcomed it as a necessary conversation,&amp;rdquo; he told me. &amp;ldquo;And I was more than happy to entertain that and to tell you that this is what you need to know for survival.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;My mother also said she had no anxiety about my exposure to America&amp;rsquo;s racial past. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember a time in my youth when she didn&amp;rsquo;t keep a healthy crop of &lt;em&gt;Ebony&lt;/em&gt; magazines around the house, and there was a time when I saw, in one issue, the infamous open-casket funeral picture of Emmett Till with his swollen, chewed-up face. I learned from reading the article that Till had been beaten to a pulp and lynched by two white men in Mississippi who accused the black teenager of flirting with a white woman. The story shook me up pretty badly, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t cause my mother to start stashing the &lt;em&gt;Ebony&lt;/em&gt;s away. When I spoke to her about this recently, she told me she was more concerned about me reading the Encyclopedia Brown series, because of &amp;ldquo;all those ghouls and monsters&amp;rdquo; in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe these childhood experiences were why I had no qualms last summer about pulling over on Jefferson Davis Highway to take my son to view one of the Confederate memorials up close. I risked scaring or scarring him by providing the context for what we were examining: the lynchings, the whippings, the Fugitive Slave Act, the drapetomania enslaved blacks were diagnosed with when they tried to run away from it all.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Justice didn&amp;rsquo;t seem traumatized at all, though. In fact, it seemed to finally be piquing his interest, possibly even piloting some small rage in him. After all, my son was coming up in the age of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, and the Charleston Nine. In the end, there&amp;rsquo;s very little I can do to shield him from those graphics. The ongoing chronicles of American racial terror are something few, if any, black families have the luxury of avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/hXEEJioaHJ0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>Harriet Tubman Was My Wonder Woman</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/hXEEJioaHJ0/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T10:55:00-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482424</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The black history icons I learned about as a child were larger-than-life&mdash;and they prepared me to grapple with America&rsquo;s racial past.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Culture\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/harriet-tubman-and-frederick-douglassmy-first-superheroes/482424/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Conor Friedersdorf</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/conor-friedersdorf/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt482454</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/05/curry/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"Why Stephen Curry Is Captivating\"\r\n            &gt;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, I rushed home to watch an NBA playoff game for the first time since the Los Angeles Lakers&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;the team I&amp;rsquo;ve cheered for my whole life&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;were last competitive. I watched the Golden State Warriors defeat the Portland Trailblazers, a victory that allows them to advance to the Western Conference Finals. But none of that mattered to me. I just wanted to watch Stephen Curry play.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;His dominance is part of what&amp;rsquo;s compelling, as when Tiger Woods arrived in the PGA and revealed that golf could be played on a higher level than anyone had ever imagined. Last season, Curry made an impressive 286 three-pointers, securing the all-time NBA record for triples made in a season by beating the next best by 10 shots. He did so in a year in which he won the MVP and his team won an NBA championship. It was reasonable to think he might break his own record, or even reach 300 threes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Then, this season, Curry made 402 three-pointers!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;After a broader assessment of his off-the-charts statistical efficiency, Benjamin Morris of 538 simply declared, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/\"&gt;Stephen Curry Is the Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; That article is the best account I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of how unfathomably valuable Curry is to his team. Yet efficiency statistics do not capture how enjoyable a player is to watch as entertainment. As Nikil Saval &lt;a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/on-kobe-bryant/\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in his comparison of Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Though Duncan may end up being accounted the greater player, I am with those who find his post-up, bank-shot style a chore to watch. Very few, even the haters, have felt this way about Kobe in his prime. Every now and again, in my frequent moments of Kobe-doubt, I find myself rewatching one of those YouTube compilations of &amp;ldquo;Top 10 Kobe Clutch Shots&amp;rdquo; to regain my faith. Comparing his various off-balance threes to close out games of Stephen Curry&amp;rsquo;s, the most sublime of shooters, shows the superiority of the latter&amp;rsquo;s game&amp;mdash;his half-court arcs slicing through the air like a knife through bean curd, with unprecedented ease&amp;mdash;but also the peculiar inimitability of Kobe&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; not a single player who is statistically &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; than Kobe has been as glorious to watch.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;While granting the sentiment, many would argue that Michael Jordan, a statistically better player, was as glorious to watch. David Foster Wallace once &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0\"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the Chicago Bulls star &amp;ldquo;one of those rare, preternatural athletes who appear to be exempt, at least in part, from certain physical laws,&amp;rdquo; noting that he &amp;ldquo;could not only jump inhumanly high but actually hang there a beat or two longer than gravity allows.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;After Jordan&amp;rsquo;s aerial grace and Kobe&amp;rsquo;s leaping theatricality, perhaps there is nothing new under the sun to be seen in dunk contests or improbable drives to basket.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;rsquo;t, anyway, how Curry dazzles, though I would argue that he too seems exempt from certain physical laws: When he&amp;rsquo;s dribbling behind the arc, a defender close at hand, it seems impossible that a 6-foot-three guard could get off a shot. But Curry always can. He dribbles, steps back, and releases the ball so quickly, smoothly, and precisely that one can&amp;rsquo;t quite make sense of it, even in slow motion.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;That tremendously impressive feat isn&amp;rsquo;t as visually spectacular as a dribble drive that ends in lift-off, a soaring, twisting flight path to the rim, and a spectacular dunk. And yet, Curry is as compelling as any slam-dunker in his own way&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;and this is, I think, for two distinct reasons. One is that, unlike Kobe or Shaq or LeBron, Curry does not have a perfect basketball body. That he dominates at his size is both more impressive and more compelling visually. The analog is Lionel Messi, whose highlights are dazzling because he is at once unstoppable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; delightfully scrappy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/191ceh8MDuI\" width=\"530\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;But in basketball, the best analog, the figure who is most helpful in understanding why Curry is so damn fun to watch, is the last point guard to be as compelling: Magic Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Showtime Lakers were among the most entertaining teams to watch in NBA history largely because of Magic&amp;rsquo;s ability to throw passes that defied all expectations. On fast breaks and in transition, he would somehow see teammates that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t have seen unless he had eyes in the back of his head. He&amp;rsquo;d deliver the ball into their hands with no-look passes as visually confounding as a trick-play in football. Even in the half-court offense, he could thread an impossible bounce pass by the legs of defenders at unlikely angles, and with all the force of a bullet. And, of course, he could score, which only helped him to pass more superbly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GoEl2Oo66IY\" width=\"530\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The effect, for the viewer, was constant suspense. You didn&amp;rsquo;t dare take your eyes off the screen when the ball was in his hands because the potential for surprise was ever-present.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Curry is like that, except that he&amp;rsquo;s a superb passer and a magical scorer. He can dazzle while setting up teammates. But the suspense he gives us flows from the fact that he could shoot anytime, from anywhere. In traffic near the basket? No problem. A defender in his face two steps behind the three-point line? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Early in the 24-second clock, mere steps past the half court line? Yes, even then and there.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gb0wmBUB4cg\" width=\"530\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;People watched the NBA for Magic, and then for Michael and Kobe and LeBron. Now they will tune in for Steph Curry, who plays unlike anyone ever has: The point guard can and might well score at any moment, so he is riveting to watch at every moment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/wd6cPBKBzdw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>Why Stephen Curry Is Captivating</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/wd6cPBKBzdw/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T10:50:00-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482454</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The NBA&rsquo;s most compelling player entertains with a kind of suspense unseen since Magic Johnson.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Culture\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/why-stephen-curry-is-captivating/482454/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Krishnadev Calamur</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/krishnadev-calamur/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt482499</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/05/AP_665138806626/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"\u2018The Ball Is in Turkey\u2019s Court\u2019: An Impasse Over a Terrorism Law\"\r\n            &gt;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The EU&amp;rsquo;s deal on migrants and refugees with Turkey is on the verge of collapse as each side is holding firm on its view of Ankara&amp;rsquo;s anti-terrorism legislation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, which went into effect in March, the EU would send those migrants and refugees who illegally entered the bloc to Turkey in exchange for an equal number of registered Syrian refugees. In return, among other things, the EU agreed to visa-free travel for Turks in the Schengen zone provided Ankara satisfied 72 conditions. One of those conditions was altering Turkey&amp;rsquo;s anti-terrorism legislation, which the EU worries could be used to target dissidents as well as journalists. Turkey had, in principle, agreed to tweak the legislation, but Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish prime minister who was one of the architects of the agreement with the EU, stepped down earlier this month following a power struggle with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country&amp;rsquo;s president. Erdogan has refused to change the law, saying it would embolden terrorists, including ISIS and Kurdish separatists. &amp;ldquo;We are going our way,&amp;rdquo; he said last week to the EU, &amp;ldquo;and you can go yours.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On Thursday in Ankara, Erdogan said the EU was moving the goal posts.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Either we will improve our relations with the EU, or we will set a new path for ourselves,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;We prefer to build the new Turkey with our EU friends, but now we will wait for the decision of our EU friends.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In Berlin, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s president, responded: &amp;ldquo;We put great value in the conditions being met. Otherwise this deal, the agreement between the EU and Turkey, won&amp;#39;t happen. If Mr Erdogan decides to deny Turks the right to free travel to Europe, then he must explain this to the Turkish people. It will not be my problem, it will be his problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The German government, which worked with Turkey closely on the migrant deal, also stood with the EU. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the foreign minister, said: &amp;ldquo;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.66667;\"&gt;The ball is in Turkey&amp;rsquo;s court.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the agreement has implications far beyond visa-free travel for Turks. The deal was struck in the first place because of Europe&amp;rsquo;s inability to deal with the massive flow of migrants and refugees from Syria and elsewhere. Presumably, that flow of migrants to the EU will pick up once more. Additionally, Turkey has &lt;a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/eu-membership-strategic-goal-turkey-erdogan-38982701\"&gt;long aspired&lt;/a&gt; to join the EU; the death of the deal could have consequences for those aspirations, as well.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/PXVlc2VzPTs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>\u2018The Ball Is in Turkey\u2019s Court\u2019: An Impasse Over a Terrorism Law</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/PXVlc2VzPTs/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T10:45:28-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482499</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The EU says an agreement over migrants and visa-free travel for Turks is in jeopardy unless Ankara changes its anti-terrorism law&mdash;in line with a previous commitment.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Global\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/the-ball-is-in-turkeys-court-an-impasse-over-terrorism/482499/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>David A.

For example, there&amp;rsquo;s Teddy Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s declaration, &amp;ldquo;I would a great deal rather be anything, say professor of history, than vice president.&amp;rdquo; Even better was John Nance Garner&amp;rsquo;s verdict that the office he held under FDR was &amp;ldquo;not worth a bucket of warm piss.&amp;rdquo; Those quips really hardly apply anymore; they&amp;rsquo;re as archaic as their authors. These days the Naval Observatory is a nice place to land. You could end up amassing unprecedented power and a man-sized safe, like Dick Cheney. You could end up with impressive power and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;become an aviator-clad folk hero, like Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe not. Will anyone want to be the running mate to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump? There are the character risks in cozying up to a man who&amp;rsquo;s liable to make a racist comment or accuse a rival&amp;rsquo;s father of being involved in the Kennedy assassination. There are the career risks of becoming associated with a man who much of the Republican Party still doesn&amp;rsquo;t like. And there are the organizational risks to signing on as No. 2 to a man who&amp;rsquo;s famously a go-it-alone maverick.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- START \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"callout\"&gt;\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Related Story&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/where-republicans-stand-on-donald-trump-a-cheat-sheet/481449/\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/05/RTX1W8YV/lead_960.jpg?1462484933\" width=\"242\" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/where-republicans-stand-on-donald-trump-a-cheat-sheet/481449/\"&gt;Where Republicans Stand on Donald Trump: A Cheat Sheet &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- END \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Will serious policymakers really risk all that? Ha! Of course they will. &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/us/politics/donald-trump-vice-president.html\"&gt;Plenty of major figures have said no&lt;/a&gt;, but plenty remain open to it. As another politician of yore, Sam Rayburn, pointed out, &amp;ldquo;Well, there is always the thought in a fellow&amp;#39;s mind that he might get to be president.&amp;rdquo; At this stage in the campaign, it&amp;rsquo;s still customary for possible picks to insist they&amp;rsquo;re not interested. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe it quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Just who Trump might choose, though, is a different matter. He &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/04/politics/donald-trump-vice-president-search/\"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; he&amp;rsquo;ll pick a politician to balance his own outsider status. Trump has also said that Ben Carson, his former rival, will help lead up the process to pick a running mate. Things didn&amp;rsquo;t get off to a great start. Carson &lt;a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/ben-carson-says-donald-trump-could-consider-democrat-for-running-mate-1462483601\"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/ben-carson-says-donald-trump-could-consider-democrat-for-running-mate-1462483601\"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that Trump might consider an independent or a Democrat; Trump promptly said he&amp;rsquo;d only pick a Republican. As the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;notes, the convention delegates will also have to ratify Trump&amp;rsquo;s choice, adding intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Who&amp;rsquo;s on the list? Here&amp;rsquo;s a cheat sheet of some of the names being floated&amp;mdash;either by Trump and his aides; or by the candidates or their supporters themselves; or perhaps just being murmured by what Russell Baker memorably called &amp;ldquo;the Great Mentioner.&amp;rdquo; Forecasting who a presidential nominee will pick as a running mate is a famously foolish errand, but we&amp;rsquo;ll keep this list updated as the situation develops, right up to Trump&amp;rsquo;s announcement, which &lt;a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/278910-trump-ill-announce-vp-pick-at-convention\"&gt;he says will come&lt;/a&gt; at the Republican National Convention in July.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"175\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/05/Newt_Gingrich_by_Gage_Skidmore_7/2be81353d.jpg\" width=\"150\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Newt Gingrich&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt; The speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999, Gingrich ran unsuccessfully for president in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scuttlebutt:&lt;/strong&gt; Gingrich is &lt;a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/434897/newt-gingrich-donald-trump-vice-president-nominee\"&gt;perhaps the leading contender in Beltway buzz&lt;/a&gt;. Though he didn&amp;rsquo;t endorse Trump during the primary, he repeatedly defended him from his critics. More recently, he wrote a fawning essay titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/5/newt-gingrich-what-they-never-understood-about-don/\"&gt;What they never understood about Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros: &lt;/strong&gt;With his long career on the Hill and in Republican circles, Gingrich would check the politics box for Trump. As an intellectual&amp;mdash;self-styled, at least&amp;mdash;he might offer some counterweight to impressions of Trump as a lightweight. Gingrich, unlike Roosevelt, would apparently rather be vice president than a professor of history.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; While less prone than Trump to racist outbursts, Gingrich has been known to &lt;a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/newt-gingrich-mulls-vp-nod-world-ideas/story?id=38928856\"&gt;say wacky things&lt;/a&gt;. He has plenty of his own critics in GOP circles, and he&amp;rsquo;s got his own personal baggage&amp;mdash;two divorces and three marriages to match Trump&amp;rsquo;s. As an aging white man, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear whether he could expand the Trump coalition. He brings little foreign-policy cred.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"171\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Ben_Carson_by_Gage_Skidmore_2/86c393cf1.jpg\" width=\"150\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Ben Carson&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;The famed retired neurosurgeon was one of the many GOP candidates Trump vanquished this year.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scuttlebutt:&lt;/strong&gt; Wait, isn&amp;rsquo;t he leading the VP search? That&amp;rsquo;s hardly an impediment&amp;mdash;just ask Dick Cheney, who led George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s running mate search and selected himself. Carson has generally said he&amp;rsquo;s not interested, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t dampened speculation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Carson is personally likable and well-liked, and he could appeal to social conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons: &lt;/strong&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t you see the GOP primary? Where Trump is untutored and sometimes scary on policy, Carson is even less tutored, and often shaky. Given his lack if politics and policy experience, he&amp;rsquo;d do little to shore up Trump&amp;rsquo;s credentials with people who view Trump as dangerously naive about policy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Chris Christie&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"170\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Chris_Christie_2011_Shankbone/8930a1bf5.jpg\" width=\"150\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;David Shankbone&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt; The governor of New Jersey, Christie was the first major establishment Republican to endorse Trump.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scuttlebutt: &lt;/strong&gt;Surely there must be some reason why Christie has been willing to endure endless mockery for standing, staring vacantly, behind Trump at campaign events. Could it be the promise of a VP slot?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Christie would bring comparative gravitas to the ticket. He&amp;rsquo;s a two-term governor and former U.S. attorney, a dynamic campaigner, and he seems to get along well with Trump. He&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahmccammon/status/729688535976976384\"&gt;already been appointed to run Trump&amp;rsquo;s transition team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Just what the ticket needs: Another angry dude from the Northeast with high unfavorables. Christie infuriated many fellow Republicans by backing Trump, but &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/where-republicans-stand-on-donald-trump-a-cheat-sheet/481449/\"&gt;now that many of them are coming around&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"175\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/05/Bob_Corker_official_Senate_photo/8188ab05a.jpg\" width=\"150\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Bob Corker&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt; A Tennessee Republican, he was first elected to the Senate in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scuttlebutt: &lt;/strong&gt;Mike Allen &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/playbook/2016/05/the-1-official-who-most-closely-fits-trumps-description-of-ideal-vp-trump-hillary-tied-in-fla-penn-bdays-andy-card-gabe-debenedetti-craig-gordon-stan-greenberg-mel-sembler-214204\"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that Corker most perfectly fits Trump&amp;rsquo;s stated qualifications for a vice-presidential ticketmate.

He&amp;rsquo;d bring some Southern balance to the ticket, and he is the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a member of the banking committee&amp;mdash;and both foreign policy and economic policy are areas where Trump has shown he needs some help. Corker signaled his openness to Trump ahead of many of his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; The flip side of being a dealmaker is that fellow Republicans don&amp;rsquo;t love Corker. He&amp;rsquo;s also a bit low-key for Trump&amp;mdash;though maybe that would be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"175\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/05/Mike_Pence_official_portrait_112th_Congress/49c932f1e.jpg\" width=\"150\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Pence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;A former U.S. representative, the current Indiana governor is a strong social conservative.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scuttlebutt:&lt;/strong&gt; Mike Allen &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/playbook/2016/05/the-1-official-who-most-closely-fits-trumps-description-of-ideal-vp-trump-hillary-tied-in-fla-penn-bdays-andy-card-gabe-debenedetti-craig-gordon-stan-greenberg-mel-sembler-214204\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Pence is in at least the early stages of vetting. Pence endorsed Trump a couple days after Trump won the Indiana primary.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros: &lt;/strong&gt;Pence is a strong social conservative and a longtime Republican officeholder&amp;mdash;two areas where Trump is weak. He&amp;rsquo;s also close to the Koch brothers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Once mentioned as a presidential contender in his own right, Pence has looked a little like damaged good since Indiana&amp;rsquo;s snafu over a religious-freedom law. (A law was passed but largely emptied out by amendments after backlash.) Pence also endorse Ted Cruz in the Hoosier State primary&amp;mdash;though he was careful to cast his remarks in general terms and not to condemn Trump at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"169\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Sarah_Palin_September_4_2014_cropped/52935af4b.jpg\" width=\"150\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is she?&lt;/strong&gt; The former governor of Alaska endorsed Trump in January. She was John McCain&amp;rsquo;s running mate in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scuttlebutt:&lt;/strong&gt; Palin is a high-profile endorser and has been an ambitious politician in the past. When Trump was asked about the prospect of running with her in January, he &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/politics/donald-trump-sarah-palin-vice-president/\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;d want to do it &amp;hellip; she&amp;rsquo;s been through that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros: &lt;/strong&gt;Trump is weak with women and still stands to convince very conservative voters that he is a true conservative. Palin might help him on both counts.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you younger than eight? (If so, go outside and play!) If not, did you sleep through the 2008 election?

Trump has sent mixed messages, saying that he&amp;rsquo;d be &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/278704-trump-interested-in-vetting-kasich-for-vp\"&gt;interested in vetting John&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; but also &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/05/trump-kasich-unlikely-to-be-my-running-mate-choice.html\"&gt;suggesting&lt;/a&gt; he was an unlikely choice.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Kasich has deep political experience, as both a congressman and a two-term governor. And he cuts a more sober figure than Trump.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Kasich&amp;rsquo;s presidential campaign weighs against him. On the one hand, it showed he has limited appeal. On the other, he spent most of it calling for sanity and reason in the race&amp;mdash;basically, everything Trump doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand for. Bloomberg reports that Trump&amp;rsquo;s camp is still courting Kasich, but he &lt;a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-10/kasich-remains-cool-to-prospect-of-joining-trump-ticket\"&gt;remains aloof to their pleas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"170\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/05/63682c308/47b13d86b.jpg\" width=\"150\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;The outgoing senator from Florida also ran against Trump.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scuttlebutt:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/278847-former-rubio-delegates-push-senator-for-donald-trumps-vp\"&gt;Some of Rubio&amp;rsquo;s delegates&lt;/a&gt; to the convention are pushing him as a running mate. Trump says it &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/278938-trump-rubio-as-vp-could-happen\"&gt;could happen&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; though other reports &lt;a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/ben-carson-trump-vp/2016/05/05/id/727426/\"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; he&amp;rsquo;s out of the running. Also Rubio has &lt;a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-as-trumps-vp-some-can-dream/2275866\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be anybody&amp;rsquo;s vice president.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; All the things that Rubio was supposed to bring to the presidential race, he could still bring: youth. Charisma. Hispanic roots and foreign-policy experience, both of which Trump badly needs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons: &lt;/strong&gt;Rubio hit Trump hard during the race, and he seems to be pretty burnt out on campaigning and politics in general. On May 9, he &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MarcoRubio/posts/10154177059937708\"&gt;posted on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;He will be best served by a running mate and by surrogates who fully embrace his campaign.

He is one of the most talented people who has ever run for the president I have ever seen.&amp;rdquo; On the veep question, he said, &amp;ldquo;I am going to be open to any way I can help. I am not going to say no.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Perry doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly have a reputation as a policy whiz, though he tried to reverse that in his second go at the presidency. He&amp;rsquo;s a steady, experienced Republican, and his Texas bravado might pair well with Trump&amp;rsquo;s New York braggadocio.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons: &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;He offers a barking carnival act that can be best described as Trumpism: a toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition if pursued.

Cruz would bring his very conservative bonafides to the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons: &lt;/strong&gt;Many leading Republicans hate Cruz as much or more than they do Trump. Also, while the two men got along well early in the campaign, Cruz unloaded on Trump&amp;mdash;understandably&amp;mdash;after Trump suggested Cruz&amp;rsquo;s father was involved in the JFK assassination, calling him a &amp;ldquo;pathological liar,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;utterly amoral,&amp;rdquo; a &amp;ldquo;narcissist,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;serial philanderer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"175\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/05/Rick_Scott_cropped/aee686a35.jpg\" width=\"150\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Rick Scott&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;Florida&amp;rsquo;s governor, Scott is a former health-care executive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scuttlebutt:&lt;/strong&gt; Scott endorsed Trump on March 15.

Meanwhile, Scarborough has complained that Trump was &lt;a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/joe-scarborough-says-he-wont-vote-for-trump-unless-he-changes-his-tune/\"&gt;genuine rather than simply pandering&lt;/a&gt; in his fearmongering on Muslims, and Trump &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/728651908563517440\"&gt;fired back at him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"175\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/05/8223917995_889d60d208_o/dadf16032.jpg\" width=\"150\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Michael Vadon / Flickr&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Mary Fallin&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is she?&lt;/strong&gt; Fallin is the second-term governor of Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scuttlebutt:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump backer of Andre Bauer of South Carolina floated her name in April; Trump &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/24/politics/mary-fallin-donald-trump-vice-president/\"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; that it was &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo; advice.

Former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer has reportedly &lt;a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/05/11/donald-trump-jan-brewer-vice-president/84262682/\"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; her.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons: &lt;/strong&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s not much of a proven quantity or familiar face at a national level.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"175\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/05/Jan_Brewer_by_Gage_Skidmore_3/a6cad1001.jpg\" width=\"150\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Jan Brewer&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is she?&lt;/strong&gt; Brewer was governor of Arizona from 2009 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scuttlebutt:&lt;/strong&gt; Brewer has reportedly recommended Mary Fallin of Oklahoma for the veep job. Asked about that, Trump told Greta Van Susteren, &amp;ldquo;Well, also Jan. Jan Brewer has been fantastic. She has been so fantastic. You know I won so big, her territory, and we won so big. And she is a fabulous woman.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros: &lt;/strong&gt;Brewer is a woman and a conservative, and her hardline views on immigration dovetail well with Trump&amp;rsquo;s.

For Republicans and conservatives, the time for hoping Trump would simply burn himself out, collapse, and go away is over. With the exits of Ted Cruz and John Kasich, the entertainer is now the presumptive GOP nominee.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;That poses a dilemma for the Republican official or conservative opinionmaker who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like Trump, disagrees with his policies, and/or thinks he will harm GOP and the conservative movement. Swallow hard and back Trump? Try to coalesce around a third-party candidate? Sit out the election and risk allowing Hillary Clinton to win the presidency, or even back her rather than risk letting Trump win?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;As the chaotic and failed attempts to stop Trump over the 10 months have shown, there&amp;rsquo;s no obviously right choice. But which choice are people making? Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of some major figures and where they stand on Trump&amp;mdash;right now. We&amp;rsquo;ll keep it updated as other important people take stances, or as these ones change their views about Trump.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Party Elders&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/05/RTXYZYB/7e3c49df4.jpg\" width=\"630\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Jason Reed/ Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George W.

If you&amp;rsquo;re a journalist, you can announce the new logo, cite all the angry tweets, and allude to how logos have to stand the test of time and how that time is longer than a few hours on Twitter, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;By the time people have drawn more considered opinions of the new design, folks beyond the professional design community have maybe forgotten that it ever happened. &lt;a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_icon_for_instagram_done_in_house.php#.VzOssGQrK2w\"&gt;As Armin Vit says at &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_icon_for_instagram_done_in_house.php#.VzOssGQrK2w\"&gt;Brand New&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;200 million people tapping on your logo every day is &amp;ldquo;the kind of brand engagement that Coca-Cola or Nike would kill for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It will only be a matter of time&amp;mdash; three months, probably&amp;mdash;before this is known, recognized, and considered as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Instagram app icon,&amp;rdquo; he adds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.66667;\"&gt;Also, in defense of the cycle, some of the angry tweets are actually pretty funny.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;\r\n&lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"&gt;Behind the scenes on the new Instagram logo &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/WPld3t0rJF\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WPld3t0rJF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&amp;mdash; Cody Sanfilippo (@codysanfilippo) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/codysanfilippo/status/730406792140890117\"&gt;May 11, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;\r\n&lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"&gt;Who wore it best?

I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ll ever love this new Instagram icon&amp;mdash;I didn&amp;rsquo;t ever adore the old one, honestly&amp;mdash;but I still think it&amp;rsquo;s instructive insofar as it hints at key ways that mass-appeal consumer technology has changed through the smartphone era.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The new logo draws inspiration from current iconographic fashion trends as clearly as the old one did. Instagram debuted in 2010, and &lt;span&gt;turn-of-the-decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph\"&gt;skeuomorphism&lt;/a&gt; is impressed all over its original mark&lt;span&gt;. The pixel-tuned detail, the rainbow flourish, the leather that&amp;rsquo;s as luxurious and approachable as the early iPhone itself: It exudes all the delighted optimism of early-2010s tech.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The new icon, meanwhile, is everything an icon is supposed to be in 2016: &lt;span&gt;flat, minimalist, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;fluorescent, and confident. In probably the most important &lt;em&gt;branding &lt;/em&gt;move of the whole redesign, Instagram brought its new gradient to its family of associated apps: Hyperlapse, Boomerang, and Layout. They look much more Instagram-adjacent now than the old ones did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"381\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/05/Screen_Shot_2016_05_11_at_6.49.12_PM/8046e165b.png\" width=\"630\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"caption\"&gt;The old Instagram, Layout, Boomerang, and Hyperlapse icons above; the new ones below (Instagram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s a broader change afoot than adherence to whatever the trend of the moment is. More than any other previous UI shift, the new icons divorce Instagram from its backward-looking past. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it debuted, Instagram pitched itself as comfortable nostalgia. Into the anxious and frenetic early 2010s it rolled&amp;mdash;that cheerful logo and the names of its filters recalling &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jaiq_ZZ_eM\"&gt;the Polaroid SX-70&lt;/a&gt; and the other classic 1960s point-and-shoots. (The importance of the midcentury photography industry to the modern-day mobile business is hard to understate: One Apple designer or another is always praising the Leica.) It appealed not because it tried to guess at the future, but because it alluded to the warmth, neighborliness, and material permanence of an impossible past. Also, the filters made once-crappy smartphone photos look passable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Now, Instagram doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to appeal to any of that. It&amp;rsquo;s just&amp;hellip; Instagram. In my estimation, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/i-like-instagram/398834/\"&gt;the only social network that most people still genuinely like to use&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;(And they don&amp;rsquo;t need to use filters anymore.) The app&amp;rsquo;s new interface, which was also redesigned, has dropped nearly every reference to its design antecedents. The interface is black and white, and the icons for each feature are the thin and simplified manifestations of their underlying metaphor. The &amp;ldquo;discover&amp;rdquo; feature tab, for instance, is barely a magnifying glass&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s a circle with a little line coming out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;So it is with the app&amp;rsquo;s icon itself. Some have wondered why Instagram didn&amp;rsquo;t retain more of the original &amp;ldquo;camera&amp;rdquo; logo in its minimalist update:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;\r\n&lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"&gt;The new icon feels great, I just wonder whether keeping slightly more of the original vibe might have been helpful&amp;hellip; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/ckAkV3qNaQ\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ckAkV3qNaQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&amp;mdash; Ian Storm Taylor (@ianstormtaylor) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ianstormtaylor/status/730458234608181248\"&gt;May 11, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;But the camera to which this new icon is alluding&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s barely even a camera. The designer Craig Mod &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/goodbye-cameras\"&gt;has written about the &amp;ldquo;networked lens,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; his name for an image sensor hooked up to the Internet and a type of object that he believes will succeed and augment cameras. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about how, until there is a major new change in function or form, &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/the-new-iphone-is-just-a-fancy-point-and-shoot/404626/\"&gt;new iPhones and Androids will only remain compelling for their updated photographic specs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The new Instagram logo is two circles in a square, one of the most basic iconographic representations of a camera-like object that I can fathom. Two circles and a square represent a lens, a light source, and a web connection&amp;mdash;except even the web connection is implicit. Once, Instagram attracted users by constantly citing precedent, by reminding users of their predecessors, by dunking every feature in a warm bowl of chunky nostalgia. Now, Instagram&amp;rsquo;s just some lines on a screen. You know what to do with it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/IQiD3dYauWg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>Instagram Ends the Nostalgia Era</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/IQiD3dYauWg/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T09:12:46-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482439</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The app&rsquo;s new icon shows what has changed about mobile technology.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Technology\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/new-instagram-icon/482439/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Krishnadev Calamur</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/krishnadev-calamur/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt482460</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/05/AP_664658564715/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"George Zimmerman&amp;#39;s Designs to Profit From Trayvon Martin&amp;#39;s Death\"\r\n            &gt;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on May 12 at 6:24 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The gun George Zimmerman used to kill Trayvon Martin and which he had hoped to sell Thursday now appears to be back on sale at another website&amp;mdash;after it was pulled from the site where it was originally being auctioned.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The 9 mm Kel-Tec PF-9 pistol was initially listed for sale at &lt;a href=\"http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=558112068\"&gt;Gunbroker.com&lt;/a&gt;, but the site later pulled the listing, &lt;a href=\"http://www.gunbroker.com/User/Announce.aspx\"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Listings on the GunBroker.com web site are user-generated, exactly like social media posts. Mr. Zimmerman never contacted anyone at GunBroker.com prior to or after the listing was created and no one at GunBroker.com has any relationship with Zimmerman. Our &lt;a href=\"http://www.gunbroker.com/User/SiteRules.aspx\" target=\"_Blank\"&gt;site rules&lt;/a&gt; state that we reserve the right to reject listings at our sole discretion, and have done so with the Zimmerman listing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;We want no part in the listing on our web site or in any of the publicity it is receiving.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The site now listing it is United Gun Group, &lt;a href=\"http://www.unitedgungroup.com/auction/detail/auction/9/slug/george-zimmerman-s-gun-used-2-26-12\"&gt;but that website appears to be down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Unitedgungroup/?pnref=lhc\"&gt;In a statement on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, that website said:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;United Gun Group offers a free platform for law-abiding citizens to buy, sell, trade and discuss firearms and related products. United Gun Group&amp;rsquo;s stance is that as long as Mr. Zimmerman (or any other UGG member) is obeying the letter of the law, his personal firearm sale will be permitted on our network. &amp;hellip; He appears to be following all applicable laws.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman, the neighborhood-watch volunteer, was acquitted of murder in the 2012 shooting death of Martin, a black 17-year-old, in Sanford, Florida. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt from the Gunbroker.com posting when it was still online:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Prospective bidders, I am honored and humbled to announce the sale of an American Firearm Icon. The firearm for sale is the firearm that was used to defend my life and end the brutal attack from Trayvon Martin on 2/26/2012. &amp;hellip; Many have expressed interest in owning and displaying the firearm including The Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C. This is a piece of American History.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The gun, Zimmerman says, was recently returned to him by the U.S. Department of Justice. He said he hopes to get at least $5,000 for the weapon, and a portion of the proceeds &amp;ldquo;&lt;span&gt;will be used to: fight BLM violence against Law Enforcement officers, ensure the demise of&amp;rdquo; Angela Corey&amp;rsquo;s career as a prosecutor, &amp;ldquo;and Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s anti-firearm rhetoric.&amp;rdquo; His posting ends with the words &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum,&amp;rdquo; a Latin phrase that means &amp;ldquo;if you want peace, prepare for war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;BLM refers to the Black Lives Matter movement, which sprung up following several high-profile incidents in which white police officers killed unarmed black men. Corey is the Florida State Attorney who failed in her attempt to prosecute Zimmerman for killing Martin. She is up for re-election.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian, &lt;a href=\"http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/statement-smithsonian-george-zimmerman-s-firearm\"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, denied it had expressed interest in the weapon.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian has never expressed interest in collecting George Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s firearm. The Smithsonian has no plans to ever collect or display this object in any of its museums.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The planned auction of the weapon prompted criticism Thursday. Indeed, Zimmerman &lt;a href=\"http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/140127772-story\"&gt;told WOFL-TV&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando, Florida, he&amp;rsquo;d received several death threats after putting the gun up for sale. &amp;ldquo;What I&amp;#39;ve decided to do is not cower,&amp;rdquo; he said. I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;a free American. I can do what I want with my possessions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Martin was walking to his father&amp;rsquo;s home in 2012 when he was shot and killed by Zimmerman inside a gated community. The neighborhood-watch volunteer said he felt threatened by the 17-year-old and successfully argued in court that his actions were protected by Florida&amp;rsquo;s Stand Your Ground laws.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Since that time, Zimmerman has been charged with assault following complaints from two girlfriends, who subsequently declined to cooperate with police, leading to the charges being dropped.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The auction for his weapon was set to begin at 11 a.m. EDT Thursday and end 24 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the planned sale, Daryl Parks, an attorney for Martin&amp;rsquo;s family, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/05/12/trayvon-martin-family-attorney-george-zimmerman-gun-auction-insulting-and-disrespectful/?tid=sm_tw\"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;It is insulting to this family that he would decided that he would sell the gun that he killed their child with. Think about what that means: This is a gun that took a child&amp;rsquo;s life and now he wants to make money off of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/WHTVrx6tLaA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>George Zimmerman's Designs to Profit From Trayvon Martin's Death</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/WHTVrx6tLaA/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T08:36:18-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482460</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The pistol he used to kill the 17-year-old is now on sale at another website after it was pulled from sale at another auction site.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"U.S.\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/05/george-zimmerman-gun-auction/482460/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Megan Garber</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/megan-garber/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt478350</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/04/lead-2/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"Arch Enemies\"\r\n            &gt;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"dropcap\"&gt;T&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;he point is to bounce, just a little.

Dolly Singh, the CEO of the shoe design firm &lt;a href=\"http://thesiscouture.com/\"&gt;Thesis Couture&lt;/a&gt;, is explaining this as I walk in a prototype version of footwear that has thus far been, due to limitations that are only partially technological in nature, pretty much impossible to imagine: shoes that are at once extremely high and relatively comfortable to wear. &amp;ldquo;What you should be feeling is, hopefully, a lot less pinch in the front than you normally do in 4-inch heels,&amp;rdquo; Singh tells me. &amp;ldquo;Because of this arch-support area&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;she points toward the sole of the model I&amp;rsquo;m wearing&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to push your weight back towards your heel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- START \"MORE ON\" LIST BOX v. 3 --&gt;&lt;!-- START \"MORE ON\" LIST BOX v. 3 --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"callout\"&gt;\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;figure href=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/03/claire/lead_960.jpg?1457382786\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/03/claire/lead_960.jpg?1457382786\" width=\"242\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/03/all-the-heels-claire-underwood-and-the-case-of-the-perma-stiletto/472572/\"&gt;All the Heels: Claire Underwood and the Case of the Stay-Put Stiletto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/the-perma-pump-the-silliest-thing-in-jurassic-world/395834/\"&gt;The Perma-Pump: &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s Silliest Character&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/what-does-it-mean-to-wear-heels/280810/\"&gt;What Does It Mean to Wear Heels?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- END \"MORE ON\" LIST BOX v. 3 --&gt;&lt;!-- END \"MORE ON\" LIST BOX v. 3 --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;You know what? It does. Or, at least, walking in a pair of Thesis stilettos&amp;mdash;whose shanks, and heels, are constructed mostly of dense, slightly flexible polymer (&amp;ldquo;ballistics-grade,&amp;rdquo; Thesis&amp;rsquo;s marketing literature points out)&amp;mdash;minimized the reflex that walking in heels normally produces in me: the need to adjust my limbs and my overall self to compensate for my unnaturally raised foot. The shoes I&amp;rsquo;m wearing, Singh told me, are only about 70 percent completed, design-wise; still, even at the prototype stage, you feel that cushion and that give and that reassuring little bounce. You feel the shock of your walk being eased. You definitely would not run in these shoes, in the manner of Carrie Bradshavian fantasy; you could, however, very reasonably walk in them. At least for, you know, a little while.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Singh, 37, is a former recruiter at SpaceX, Elon Musk&amp;rsquo;s rocket engineering firm whose offices in Hawthorne, CA, consist largely of hangar and factory space. She spent much of her time on that job walking&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;about 3 to 4 miles a day,&amp;rdquo; she recalls&amp;mdash;on hard floors that were particularly ill-suited to the wearing of heels. She wore them anyway: Working in an industry dominated by men, she appreciated the few extra inches of height the shoes gave her. (And also: the sense of professionalism, and of femininity.) It didn&amp;rsquo;t take much research to realize that many women, every day, live their own version of that compromise. So, when Singh left SpaceX, she recruited some of its employees&amp;mdash;among them, yes, a rocket scientist and a former astronaut&amp;mdash;to help solve a problem that is generally not treated as a problem at all so much as an unfortunate fact of ladylife: the insult and occasionally the injury that can come from the wearing of heels.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"dropcap\"&gt;S&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;tripped of their symbolism, heels are, simply, shoes like any other: objects that help to separate the human foot, which is inconveniently soft, from the surface of the earth, which is inconveniently hard. And yet, of course, heels do&amp;mdash;heels are&amp;mdash;so much more than mere footwear. In their teetering heights, they make audacious assumptions about fashion and feminism and professionalism and sex and privilege and power and its opposite, and about the way all those things, in the early 21st century, chafe against each other. Heels at once lift women up and hold them&amp;mdash;hold us&amp;mdash;back. And, of course: We choose, day by day and week by week and &lt;a href=\"http://www.lordandtaylor.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lord-and-taylor/search/shoes/special-occasion-54154--1\"&gt;Special Occasion&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"http://www.aldoshoes.com/us/en_US/women/special-occasion/c/7129\"&gt;Special Occasion&lt;/a&gt;, to let them do it. Heels are both a claim of femininity and a test of it. They are the bindings of the willfully bound.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hate high heels, more than anything.&amp;rdquo; - Cara Delevingne &amp;nbsp;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In that sense, while Thesis&amp;rsquo;s comfortable heel represents a small feat, so to speak, it also represents a very large one: a counterargument to a longstanding assumption&amp;mdash;rendered in fashion as well as in many other areas of the culture&amp;mdash;that womanhood is defined, in part, by the ability to bear pain. Not just in the sense of &amp;ldquo;suffering for beauty,&amp;rdquo; as the saying goes, but in the deeper sense that the collision of those two things is integral to feminine experience. It&amp;rsquo;s an assumption that helps to explain why stilettos have become such quintessential symbols of womanhood; it also helps to explain why they are, as those symbols, so deeply unsettling. Heels hurt. They slow their wearers down. They occasionally trip them up.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;What Thesis&amp;rsquo;s work suggests, though, is that the technology of the heel, the manufactured thing that takes its name from the natural one, could change the politics of the heel. The comfortable stiletto Thesis is promising is one that, simply because it hurts its wearers less, also demands less of them&amp;mdash;and, by extension, of all of us.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thesis is certainly not the first company to claim to have made a comfortable heel. What makes its approach unique, though, is that it isn&amp;rsquo;t relying on low heel heights or thick heel widths or wide toe boxes or excessive interior padding&amp;mdash;the stuff of dancing shoes and Naturalizers and their ilk&amp;mdash;to improve its heels&amp;rsquo; comfort levels. (&amp;ldquo;Comfort shoe,&amp;rdquo; indeed, is something of an epithet around Thesis&amp;rsquo;s sleek L.A. office.) Instead, the company reconsidered the architectural framework of the shoe.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The people Singh recruited, from SpaceX and elsewhere, to advise Thesis in doing that work included Hans Koenigsmann, the (yes) rocket scientist. And Garrett Reisman, the (yes) former astronaut. And Matt Thomas, the former director of mechanical engineering at Oculus VR, the (now-Facebook-owned) virtual reality firm. And Andy Goldberg, an orthopedic surgeon. And Francis Bitonti, a designer&amp;mdash;he created &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LazcMO028Ys\"&gt;that iconic, 3-D-printed gown&lt;/a&gt; for the burlesque star Dita Von Teese&amp;mdash;who has become an expert at using algorithms to ensure garments&amp;rsquo; fit. Singh also brought on Amanda Parkes, a fashion technologist, to ensure that the shoes the company created would be stylish as well as comfortable. Not running-shoe-comfortable, to be extra-clear, but for-a-high-heel-comfortable. &amp;ldquo;What we&amp;rsquo;re fundamentally trying to do,&amp;rdquo; Singh explains, &amp;ldquo;is make a stiletto that feels like a wedge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/04/thesis_heel/7df9ab069.jpg\" width=\"630\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"caption\"&gt;The inner workings of a Thesis stiletto (Thesis Couture)&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, the team first replaced the thin, metal spike that supports the typical heel with one made of that ballistics-grade polymer. Just as importantly, though, they played around with the shank of the shoe&amp;mdash;the base of the sole, the structure that does the all-important work of arch support&amp;mdash;in order to distribute the wearer&amp;rsquo;s weight toward the heel and thus away from the ball of the foot, the source of so much orthopedic pain. Thesis&amp;rsquo;s S-curved shanks lead to shoes that concentrate only about 50 percent of the wearer&amp;rsquo;s weight there&amp;mdash;an improvement from the current industry average of 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The whole thing was much more complicated than Singh first anticipated. &amp;ldquo;I came from rockets and VR,&amp;rdquo; she notes. &amp;ldquo;I thought that six months after I started this project, I&amp;rsquo;d have the most amazing shoes that the planet has ever seen. And here I am, three years later&amp;mdash;and I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;finished.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s appropriate, though, that creating those shoes would transform from a &amp;ldquo;project&amp;rdquo; to a broader purpose: The appeal of heels&amp;mdash;not just of sky-high stilettos, but also of their less audacious cousins&amp;mdash;lies, most broadly, in their ability to function not just as footwear, but also as small, wearable symbols of mankind&amp;rsquo;s tendency toward restless ambition. Heels have emerged from roughly the same impulse that led to cathedrals and skyscrapers and, yes, rockets: our desire to be taller, and grander, and generally more than we once were. &amp;ldquo;You never find wonderful and great things on the ground, but instead placed on high, to fill others with wonder and reverence,&amp;rdquo; Arcangela Tarabotti, a Venetian nun, &lt;a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/heels/\"&gt;argued in the 17th century&lt;/a&gt;. She was defending a very early version of the stiletto.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;The core of my work is dedicated not to pleasing women but to pleasing men.&amp;rdquo; - Christian Louboutin&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;So you can ask why heels, given all that they demand of their wearers, continue to be so popular&amp;mdash;and, indeed, to be such easy tokens of femininity, used in everything from &lt;a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/26880928999027492/?from_navigate=true\"&gt;baked goods&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"http://www.walmart.com/search/?query=scotch%20-%20Shoe%20Tape%20Dispenser%20with%203%2F4%20x%20350%20Roll%20Magic%20Tape%20-%20Honeysuckle\"&gt;office products&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/15/463200139/taiwan-now-has-a-shiny-shoe-shaped-church\"&gt;houses of worship&lt;/a&gt;. You can point out all the compromises, large and small, that must be made when a person&amp;mdash;usually, but not always, a female person&amp;mdash;buys, and wears, and navigates the world upon, a pair of upthrust metal spikes. You can say (as Carrie Bradshaw, that character who derived so hefty a portion of her identity from her Manolo Blahniks, might have): &lt;em&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder &amp;hellip; What puts the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;high heels&amp;rdquo;? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;But to do all that, fashion being what it is, you also have to acknowledge all the things we women gain, or are told that we gain, from the wearing of heels, aesthetically and professionally and otherwise. Thesis Couture plans to include just 1,500 pairs of shoes&amp;mdash;retail price: $925 each&amp;mdash;in &lt;a href=\"http://thesiscouture.com/wp-content/uploads/thesis_lookbook_ibook.pdf\"&gt;its inaugural line&lt;/a&gt;, coming out this fall. At a recent soft-launch event, in New York, Singh announced to the assembled crowd that they could add their names to the waiting list of people who have expressed advance interest in purchasing one of those pairs. The list, Singh told me, currently has more than 10,000 names.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;So, yes: Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;high heels.&amp;rdquo; But first let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the we.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"dropcap\"&gt;Y&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;ouTube, in its capacity as a massive, user-generated advice column, has many tips on offer about the best ways to walk in heels. The mega-vlogger Michelle Phan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfN1Ks_4dig\"&gt;How to Master the High Heel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; tutorial&amp;mdash;3.5 million views so far&amp;mdash;provides an appropriately step-by-step approach. &amp;ldquo;Your first assignment when walking in heels,&amp;rdquo; she says, &amp;ldquo;is to find a straight line and follow it.&amp;rdquo; Phan pays particular attention to the distinct challenges presented by cobblestones (&amp;ldquo;for every step you take, you need to have a general awareness of where your heel is being placed&amp;rdquo;), and grass (&amp;ldquo;keep your weight on your toes&amp;rdquo;), and stairs (descending them, in particular, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s all about keeping a steady pace and a firm placement on each step&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;but also, just to be safe, &amp;ldquo;use the handrail&amp;rdquo;). Phan also offers a more generalized tip for effective heel-ing: &amp;ldquo;Putting on your favorite upbeat song will help you get in the mood as you practice your walk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Phan&amp;rsquo;s tips are joined, and occasionally contradicted, by thousands more. Kassandra Brooks &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChmi-2iPjN9qqC49tFX9CjA\"&gt;reiterates the importance of preparation&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to walking in heels: &amp;ldquo;Seriously, girls: practice, practice, practice!&amp;rdquo; she coaches. Victor Chu, a shoe designer who teaches a class about &lt;a href=\"http://legworkclasses.com/\"&gt;how to walk in heels&lt;/a&gt;, recommends that you &amp;ldquo;engage your abs&amp;mdash;this gives you poise and control&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and &amp;ldquo;walk heel to toe, which transfers impact to the leg instead of the ball of the foot.&amp;rdquo; (Also, &amp;ldquo;relax your hips and knees so you&amp;rsquo;ll be fluid and graceful.&amp;rdquo;) Pooja from Glamrs.com &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbPjAcAiRf8\"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; swiping deodorant onto the feet to minimize the friction of heels. (Ellebangs, for the record, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQUKKCGSzs\"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the same blister-preventing effect can be achieved with baby powder.) &amp;ldquo;If [the shoes are] a little bit loose, you can always shove toilet paper into the front,&amp;rdquo; the model Cassandra Bankson &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyXJ8W5w9bo\"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;.

The discomfort of high heels&amp;mdash;the fact that they ultimately fail at the job of being functional&amp;mdash;is evidence, in that sense, of technological failure.&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;And so is the fact that heels tend to make that most basic of human activities&amp;mdash;walking&amp;mdash;a little bit precarious. &amp;ldquo;Stilettos,&amp;rdquo; in particular: Their name comes from the Italian for &amp;ldquo;dagger,&amp;rdquo; but their shape suggests a broader menace. Heels that are both skinny and sky-scraping are the things that, in 1993, led Naomi Campbell to &lt;a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/11/up-up-up-the-hottest-high-heels-in-history.html\"&gt;trip, dramatically, on Vivienne Westwood&amp;rsquo;s runway&lt;/a&gt;, the victim of the designer&amp;rsquo;s Super Elevated Gillie heels. They are the things that, in 2013, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE3MQOH8cv4\"&gt;felled Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; as she took to the stage to accept her Academy Award. They are the things that, in an episode of &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt;, found Carrie walking in a friend&amp;rsquo;s fashion show, swaggering in a pair of stilettos ... until, in short order, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDOdrcV5dfs\"&gt;she tripped on them&lt;/a&gt;. There Carrie was, channeling Naomi: splayed on the runway, brought low by the very footwear she&amp;rsquo;d trusted to raise her up.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"559\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/04/Screen_Shot_2016_04_11_at_5.23.40_PM/1c8b3a1fc.png\" width=\"630\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"caption\"&gt;Christian Louboutin&amp;rsquo;s shoe &amp;ldquo;Printz&amp;rdquo; from his Spring/Summer collection in 2013 (Jay Zukerkorn / Christian Louboutin / Currier Museum of Art)&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s telling, too, that Sarah Jessica Parker, a real-life lover of heels, reportedly &lt;a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dolly-singh/to-jorge-cortell-from-a-high-heeled-entrepreneur_b_4214459.html\"&gt;suffers from foot-related health problems&lt;/a&gt;. So does her fellow heelaholic, Victoria Beckham. (This is another of Thesis Couture&amp;rsquo;s main selling points: Its shoes are shots against the prevailing assumption that, as Singh puts it, &amp;ldquo;you get frumpier shoes, or you&amp;rsquo;re going to get frumpier feet.&amp;rdquo;) &lt;a href=\"http://www.apma.org/Media/PRdetail.cfm?ItemNumber=13076\"&gt;A study conducted in 2014 by the American Podiatric Medical Association&lt;/a&gt; found 38 percent of women saying they&amp;rsquo;d wear a shoe they liked even if it caused discomfort; another 71 percent said they already have a heel-related foot ailment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Heels, indeed, are thought to be the cause of much of &lt;a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/high-heels-can-be-a-pain-in-the-feet/237/?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost\"&gt;the roughly $3.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; that women in the United States spend each year on foot surgeries. The desire to wear them comfortably has led some women to get botulism&amp;mdash;Botox&amp;mdash;injected into their feet: Dr. Scholl meeting Dr. Frankenstein. That same desire is the source of &amp;ldquo;Haglund&amp;rsquo;s deformity,&amp;rdquo; a painful condition that has been given the revealing nickname of &amp;ldquo;pump bump,&amp;rdquo; and also of bunions and hammertoes and many more extremely preventable podiatric ailments.

When Beyonc&amp;eacute; &lt;a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beyonceknowles/countdown.html\"&gt;sings&lt;/a&gt;, in &amp;ldquo;Countdown,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m all up under him like it&amp;rsquo;s cold, winter time / All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; it is extremely clear what she really means by &amp;ldquo;dinner.&amp;rdquo; Women wear heels, in part, to reap the benefits of their ability to lengthen the leg and firm the calves and protrude the pelvis and affect the walk in Darwinianly dutiful ways. Heels function, the University of Portsmouth psychologist Paul Morris and his co-authors &lt;a href=\"http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(12)00122-5/abstract\"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; in a 2013 paper, as &amp;ldquo;supernormal stimuli&amp;rdquo;: Walking in them exaggerates &amp;ldquo;some sex-speci\ufb01c elements of female gait,&amp;rdquo; encouraging &amp;ldquo;greater pelvic rotation, increased vertical motion at the hip, shorter strides, and higher number of steps per minute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/04/infographic/99ad862d7.jpg\" width=\"630\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Kara Gordon / The Atlantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;That many women&amp;mdash;on behalf, generally, of many men&amp;mdash;seem to understand all this intuitively is the reason for articles like&lt;em&gt; Cosmopolitan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/advice/g1750/sexy-stiletto-high-heels/\"&gt;20 Heels Men Find So Freaking Hot&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; But here&amp;rsquo;s another thing&amp;mdash;a related thing, and also a deeply conflicting thing&amp;mdash;that many women seem to understand: that heels are, especially in the various knowledge-work industries, the expected foundation of a woman&amp;rsquo;s professional uniform. They are a much less comfortable, but equally conformist, version of the male suit-and-tie: a price of entry to a C-suite or a Senate office or any of the other places traditionally occupied by men. (See: Sheryl Sandberg and Marissa Mayer, TED-talking and speech-giving and otherwise boss-ladying in soaring stilettos. See also: Dolly Singh, walking miles a day in factories and in hangars and in heels.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Which means that failing to wear heels, the logic goes, might even hold women&amp;rsquo;s careers back. As &lt;em&gt;Marie Claire&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/tips/a7602/casual-friday-problems/\"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt; in a 2013 article about the sartorial&amp;mdash;and professional&amp;mdash;pitfalls of &amp;ldquo;casual Friday&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It gets tricky with shoes, especially flats, which for many women are a casual Friday mainstay. I&amp;rsquo;ve interviewed countless women CEOs, founders, and top-level execs over the years&amp;mdash;not a single one in flats, which exude a kind of demure good-girl quality that rarely telegraphs power. If you&amp;rsquo;re ambitious, with your eyes steadily fixed on a corner office, you&amp;rsquo;d do well to save them for weekends and stick with pumps or kitten heels.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;So. Heels as power. Heels as sex, co-opted in the name of professionalism. Heels as, in all that, ambition. Avery Jessup, the hyper-ambitious Fox News reporter on &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.30rockquotes.net/seasons/season_4/30rockquotes_i_do_do.cfm\"&gt;summarized the thinking perfectly&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Flats,&amp;rdquo; she declared, &amp;ldquo;are for quitters.&amp;rdquo; RuPaul &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/rupaul/status/592341849949360128\"&gt;would agree&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another irony, though: The shoes women wear in the service of both professional expectations and sexual ones, shoes that at once celebrate and underplay the murky connections between the two, are often not really respected by &amp;hellip; men in the workplace. The shoes that can bring women up to the level, physically and otherwise, of their male colleagues can also end up diminishing them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async crossorigin src='//genius.com/annotations/load_standalone_embeds.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;That might be because of incidental features&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;nothing is more aggravating than listening high heels clicking on the tile at work in the morning,&amp;rdquo; the Twitter user David Schenk &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/IAMDSCHENK/status/711195048147202048\"&gt;recently [sic] put it&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;but it is mostly because of high heels&amp;rsquo; professional paradox: the fact that the default footwear of corporate conformity is so stridently suggestive of sex. According to the researchers Raj Persaud and Adrian Furnham, &lt;a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-raj-persaud/why-do-high-heels_b_3691829.html\"&gt;discussing Paul Morris&amp;rsquo;s paper&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Female baboons with a larger than normal swelling of the bottom, associated with the sexually receptive period of their cycle, arouse greater sexual interest in males. High heels similarly exaggerate the sex-speci\ufb01c aspects of the female walk, which could cause sexual arousal in males.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"462\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/04/EL129.109/0224ec8d1.jpg\" width=\"630\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"caption\"&gt;Walter Steiger&amp;rsquo;s shoes &amp;ldquo;Unicorn Tayss&amp;rdquo; from his Spring 2013 collection (Jay Zukerkorn / Walter Steiger / Currier Museum of Art)&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Taken to its extreme, the paradox accuses heels of emphasizing the body at the expense of the mind. At a tech conference in 2013, Jorge Cortell, the CEO of a healthcare startup, noticed a fellow attendee standing in a pair of very tall stilettos. He snapped a picture of the shoes. He then tweeted the picture of the shoes with the caption, &amp;ldquo;Event supposed to be for entrepreneurs, VCs, but these heels (I&amp;rsquo;ve seen several like this) &amp;hellip; WTF?&amp;rdquo; He concluded his observation with a hashtag: &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23brainsnotrequired&amp;amp;src=hash\"&gt;#brainsnotrequired&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Cortell&amp;rsquo;s creep-shot went viral; that is mostly because its caption rightly made people mad, but it is also because its assumptions struck a much deeper nerve. The tweet harkened back, on the one hand, to the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, who tried women &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://history-of-heels.weebly.com/disappearance-of-heels.html\"&gt;who used footwear as an entrapment and seduction of men&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; for, yep, witchcraft. But it also reflected a more modern pitfall: the idea that heels are, essentially, a form of cheating&amp;mdash;a strategy for compensating not just for a relatively small stature, but for a relatively small intellect. Which is not, generally speaking, a strategy that is available to men (many of whom would probably enjoy being a few inches taller). Thus: heel-shaming. Sole-policing. #brainsnotrequired-ing. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve overheard conversations at academic gatherings,&amp;rdquo; the University of Exeter professor Francesca Stavrakopoulou &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/oct/26/-sp-female-academics-dont-power-dress-forget-heels-and-no-flowing-hair-allowed\"&gt;wrote in 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;in which female colleagues have been described as &amp;lsquo;power-dressing&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;coded language used to accuse a woman of asserting herself in overly ambitious ways.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Women will wear their high-heeled shoes until their feet are bloody stumps.&amp;rdquo; - podiatrist Michael Liebow&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;That tension&amp;mdash;women, dressed down for the crime of dressing up&amp;mdash;is on the one hand simply another aspect of the broader catch-22 that any members of a media-driven society must navigate every day: &lt;em&gt;Look good, but don&amp;rsquo;t you dare be caught trying too hard to look good&lt;/em&gt;. But heels represent a particular strain of that paradox: Many men, though they may well love what heels do to the female form&amp;mdash;there are of course many more than &lt;em&gt;Cosmo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 20 pairs of stilettos out there that men find &lt;em&gt;so freaking hot&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;also seem to think that heels are, simply, silly. Steve Martin mocks them via &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bhrBdgYTV8\"&gt;his musical bit&lt;/a&gt; on &amp;ldquo;cruel heels.&amp;rdquo; The journalist Martin Daubney, after a day spent wearing six-inch stilettos, notes that &amp;ldquo;I finally understand why women say &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo;s torture in these heels.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; One of the heel-try-ers in &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPW2JUj8teM\"&gt;Men Try Heels For A Day&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; video complains, &amp;ldquo;This is a fucking mess&amp;mdash;how am I supposed to walk in this?&amp;rdquo; Another declares, having gone through only a portion of his stunt-stipulated day in elevated footwear: &amp;ldquo;My thoughts on heels are very much the same as they were in the beginning: that they&amp;rsquo;re stupid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;His thoughts are, it turns out, part of a long-standing tradition when it comes to the gender dynamics of heels. In 1660, &lt;a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/01/24/\"&gt;in one of his journal entries&lt;/a&gt;, the great diarist Samuel Pepys wrote,&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the morning to my office, where, after I had drank my morning draft at Will&amp;rsquo;s with Ethell and Mr. Stevens, I went and told part of the excise money till twelve o&amp;rsquo;clock, and then called on my wife and took her to Mr. Pierces, she in the way being exceedingly troubled with a pair of new pattens, and I vexed to go so slow, it being late.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pattens&amp;mdash;clogs, essentially, their wooden soles stacked upon inches-high metal rings&amp;mdash;were one of the 17th century&amp;rsquo;s most popular forms of elevated shoe. Thus did Pepys and his wife join in a ritual that had been performed by many couples before, and that would be continued by many long after: a woman, struggling to walk in her high shoes; a man, struggling to disguise his annoyance at being slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"dropcap\"&gt;A&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;nd yet. And yet! Despite all of this&amp;mdash;despite heels&amp;rsquo; danger and discomfort, despite the tutting and the mocking and the difficulty walking &amp;hellip; women keep buying heels. We keep wearing them. Reader: &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; keep wearing them! I, too, have dutifully pasted my DreamWalk&amp;reg; insoles into some bedazzled 3-inchers in preparation for a friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding. I, too, have tried to take Victor Chu&amp;rsquo;s advice to walk &amp;ldquo;fluidly and gracefully&amp;rdquo; in those shoes. I, too, have failed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The 3.5 million views Michelle Phan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfN1Ks_4dig\"&gt;How to Master the High Heel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; tutorial has received since its posting in 2013 are signs of her overall popularity, sure, but they are evidence of something else, too: all the people out there who really, really want to achieve that mastery. &amp;ldquo;I think it is in our DNA as women to want to be peacocks and strut our stuff,&amp;rdquo; Tina Sloan, a longtime soap opera actor, &lt;a href=\"http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/why-we-love-the-shoes-that-hurt-us/?_r=0\"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;. The &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/heels/\"&gt;Killer Heels&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum, in 2014, took visitors through a corridor whose walls were covered with Polaroids of women&amp;rsquo;s heel-clad feet. The images included Sharpie-scrawled captions the women had provided: single-word answers to the question of how the shoes made them feel. &amp;ldquo;Fierce,&amp;rdquo; read one. &amp;ldquo;Classic!&amp;rdquo; read another. &amp;ldquo;On fire,&amp;rdquo; read another. And also: &amp;ldquo;Wow!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Cool.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;In charge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;My thoughts on heels are very much the same as they were in the beginning: that they&amp;rsquo;re stupid.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - a guy, after a day spent wearing them&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;So the answer to the &lt;em&gt;why? &lt;/em&gt;of heels&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;why, in spite of everything, do women, by which I mean myself and maybe you, keep wearing them?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;cannot simply be that heels are a commercial decision women make in the name of style. It&amp;rsquo;s much, much more complicated than that. Heels&amp;rsquo; current desirability is the result of various cultural tautologies: They are attractive, basically, because we have told ourselves that they are. They are professional, basically, because we have decided that they are. They are what they are because of what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;, all of us, are.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;So the many factors at play in heels&amp;rsquo; metonymic femininity make it extremely difficult to disentangle the Google search that leads people to Michelle Phan&amp;rsquo;s video from the conventional wisdom holding that heels, and specifically female bodies walking in heels, are hot. When Dita Von Teese &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/fashion/dita-von-teese-from-burlesque-to-a-brand.html\"&gt;announces&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;ldquo;heels and red lipstick will put the fear of God into people,&amp;rdquo; that may be the culmination of her own experience, but it is also the product of centuries&amp;rsquo; worth of cultural input. So is the reality-star-turned-lifestyle-guru Kristin Cavallari&amp;rsquo;s decision to title her memoir &lt;a href=\"http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781623366384\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Balancing in Heels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Heels are subject to all the assorted complexities that will be layered, parfait-like, onto any question of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;And yet the extremes they represent&amp;mdash;the highs and lows, the aspiration and the acquiescence&amp;mdash;make them especially apt as symbols for the current moment: one in which feminism&amp;rsquo;s various waves have evaporated, in some sense, into an air of possibility, and also of confusion. One that in many ways takes women&amp;rsquo;s equality for granted, and that in many others totally does not. One that is renavigating sex&amp;rsquo;s place in the workplace. One that is typified by a heel-clad Beyonc&amp;eacute;&amp;mdash;a wife and a mother and also pretty much the dictionary definition of &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&lt;a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/1910270/beyonce-2014-vma-perfomance/\"&gt;strutting onstage as the word &amp;ldquo;FEMINIST&amp;rdquo; flashes on a screen behind her&lt;/a&gt;. One that finds Mattel &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/barbies-hips-dont-lie/432741/\"&gt;redesigning the feet of its Barbie dolls&lt;/a&gt; so that they are not permanently molded to accommodate heels.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a moment that is unsure, basically, whether feminine footwear that evokes the swollen butts of baboons celebrates, in the end, empowerment or submission.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I do not improvise in heels. I improvise in sneakers. Why would I improvise in heels? It&amp;rsquo;s terrible.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Amy Poehler&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;And: It&amp;rsquo;s one that finds the wearing of heels&amp;mdash;or, conversely, the non-wearing of them&amp;mdash;representing much more of a choice than it did for those who came before. &amp;ldquo;Fashionable suffering is no longer obligatory as it was for our grandmothers,&amp;rdquo; Nancy Rexford, the author of &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Womens-Shoes-America-1795-1930-Rexford/dp/0873386566\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s Shoes in America: 1795 to 1930&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/why-we-love-the-shoes-that-hurt-us/?_r=0\"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;If a woman wears cruel shoes,&amp;rdquo; she adds, &amp;ldquo;we can be sure it is by choice.&amp;rdquo; And yet, of course, that &amp;ldquo;choice&amp;rdquo; will be informed by all the cultural and sexual and professional and sartorial expectations that can make shoes, symbolically as well as physically, uncomfortable. (Are heels sexist? Oh, totally. Or, well, &lt;a href=\"http://www.debate.org/opinions/can-a-feminist-wear-high-heels\"&gt;maybe&lt;/a&gt;? How can you tell? (And also: Is makeup sexist? Or long hair? Leg-shaving? Bikini-waxing? Spanx?))&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s always seemed to me that the point was to be able to wear what you fucking well please, as I&amp;rsquo;m often quoted as saying,&amp;rdquo; Gloria Steinem &lt;a href=\"http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/funny/Fierce-Funny-Feminists.html\"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. She continued, though:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are some symbols that were so forced on us in my youth that it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to understand them as a free choice. Like girdles, garter belts, and very high heels that you can&amp;rsquo;t run in &amp;hellip; but even if I felt internally uneasy, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I ever was publicly critical of something another woman said she had freely chosen.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;So even Gloria Steinem, it seems, is a little confused about heels. Which is both reassuring and no help at all. The only thing clear at this point seems to be that heels, as symbols, require of the culture precisely what they require of their wearers: compromise. Carefulness. Step-by-step transactions. Heels give power and they take it. Michelle Phan chooses to buy stilettos; she works hard at walking in them; she gets confidence from wearing them. And yet her &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfN1Ks_4dig\"&gt;final piece of advice&lt;/a&gt; for wearing them on a night out is this: &amp;ldquo;Bring a pair of flats! And if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a pair of flats, get someone to carry you home!&amp;rdquo; Phan&amp;rsquo;s cheery tutorial cuts to video of her grinning as she perches upon the back of a gallant young gentleman. Together, they gallop off into the sunset, beautifully fused&amp;mdash;two minds, two hearts, and one pair of functioning feet.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"dropcap\"&gt;F&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;urther complicating things is the fact that heels, pretty much throughout their history, have been designed by men. And men, in general, being the ones who will see the shoes but not wear them, tend to design heels with a focus on their aesthetics, rather than their ergonomics. Christian Louboutin, the moment&amp;rsquo;s reigning heel-maker, &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/03/28/sole-mate\"&gt;recently declared&lt;/a&gt;, without any apparent irony: &amp;ldquo;The core of my work is dedicated not to pleasing women but to pleasing men.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The stiletto, in particular&amp;mdash;the shoe that serves, at this point, as the Platonic pump&amp;mdash;co-evolved as an idea, &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Heights_of_fashion.html?id=dpYOAQAAMAAJ\"&gt;the historian Elizabeth Semmelhack argues&lt;/a&gt;, with the invention of photography. Which was also, human nature being what it is, the rise of photographic pornography. The entrepreneurial pornographers of the 19th century clad their subjects in heeled shoes that would complement a woman&amp;rsquo;s legs as she laid and lounged, languidly and otherwise nakedly; the shoes&amp;rsquo; presence in the photos reflected a desire, Semmelhack suggests, to prevent the models &amp;ldquo;from drifting into the allegorical realm.&amp;rdquo; (An airy goddess doesn&amp;rsquo;t wear heels; a regular, flesh-and-blood woman, however, might.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: 'Lyon Display', Georgia, Times, serif; font-size: 36px; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.05556;\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think it is in our DNA as women to want to be peacocks and strut our stuff.&amp;rdquo; - Tina Sloan, &lt;/span&gt;soap opera actor&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The images that arose from the collision of new technological capability and age-old human impulse served as formats for the ones that would come to permeate the culture later on&amp;mdash;from advertisements (airbrushed pictures of women wearing little save for heels, used to sell everything from cars to stockings, to women as well as men) to the iconic &amp;ldquo;pin-ups&amp;rdquo; that would festoon the walls of so many bedrooms across the country.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Those images did not, however, offer a format for actual footwear. Stilettos, as depicted in those commercial images, couldn&amp;rsquo;t yet exist as wearable, walkable footwear; it was not until the advent of modern steel production, in the 20th century, that functional versions could be fabricated. Only then&amp;mdash;via the designer Roger Vivier, who would go on to liken his spindly, space-age-y shoes to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/v_and_a/status/693365686295478272\"&gt;wearing dreams on one&amp;rsquo;s feet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;could the heels that had existed for so long as objects of male fantasy actually be worn by their putative consumers. Marilyn Monroe was, perhaps unwittingly, on to something when &lt;a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/30254-i-don-t-know-who-invented-high-heels-but-all-women\"&gt;she declared&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know who invented high heels, but all women owe him a lot!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know who invented them. What we do know, though, is that heels have spent much of their relatively brief tenure functioning, and being understood, as quintessentially male footwear. Heeled shoes (as opposed to simply elevated, or platform, versions, which have been around &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Heights_of_fashion.html?id=dpYOAQAAMAAJ\"&gt;for thousands of years&lt;/a&gt;) are &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Heights_of_fashion.html?id=dpYOAQAAMAAJ\"&gt;believed to have been invented in Persia&lt;/a&gt;, sometime around the 9th century&amp;mdash;martial innovations that allowed the cavalry more control over their movements as they fought in stirrups. Heels &lt;a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4593077-heights-of-fashion\"&gt;came to Western Europe as the Persian mounted military did&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;in the early 17th century, as Persia emerged as a potential European ally against the Ottoman Empire&amp;mdash;and their popularity was spurred, so to speak, by Europeans&amp;rsquo; obsession with &amp;ldquo;Eastern&amp;rdquo; fashions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/05/P06_0012/f3c9065ac.jpg\" width=\"630\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"caption\"&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s shoe c. 1700 (image courtesy the Bata Shoe Museum)&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Women, in short order, began adopting heels for their own use. It was Italian courtesans, &lt;a href=\"http://www.racked.com/2015/2/3/7997175/high-heels-history\"&gt;some historians believe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;the women, essentially high-class prostitutes, who interacted almost exclusively with men&amp;mdash;who led the trend. In the course of keeping men company, courtesans also indulged in &amp;ldquo;manly&amp;rdquo; activities that were off-limits to &amp;ldquo;respectable&amp;rdquo; women: drinking, smoking, reading. The stuff of 17th-century &lt;a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/13306276-gone-girl\"&gt;Cool Girls&lt;/a&gt;. Soon enough, they added the wearing of heels to the masculine mix.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;As the style trickled down, as such things will, to other women&amp;mdash;who likely appreciated not just the height they offered, but also the way they protected skirts from the muck of the streets&amp;mdash;heels came to signify not gender, but luxury: It was only the very wealthy who could navigate a soft and messy and dirty world in shoes as impractical as heels. (Thus: &amp;ldquo;well-heeled.&amp;rdquo;) Heels got higher, and more audacious. They got decorated. They also began diverging in their design to emphasize gender distinctions among their wearers: Women&amp;rsquo;s shoes became more slender and curvaceous, Helen Persson, a curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21151350\"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, while men&amp;rsquo;s embraced a slightly lower, thicker, stacked heel.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Flats are for quitters.&amp;rdquo; - RuPaul&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;But not that much lower. You know all those paintings of Louis XIV, posing proudly in his silks and furs and totally wearing high heels? His shoes suggest the same thing the rest of his outfits do: wealth, status, privilege. The king, &lt;a href=\"http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/feet-of-engineering/\"&gt;the podcaster Roman Mars notes&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;is dressing like the pillar of normative aristocratic masculinity that he is&amp;mdash;nothing effeminate about him.&amp;rdquo; So jealously did Louis guard his shoes&amp;rsquo; status that he passed a law stipulating that no one in the land could wear heels as high as his own. He also began the practice of painting his heels red, and allowing only the members of his court to do the same&amp;mdash;a visual symbol of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=QCIxgIZ4w38C&amp;amp;q=1670#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=1670&amp;amp;f=false\"&gt;the elevation of his court above the rest of humanity&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (Christian Louboutin, today&amp;mdash;though the designer &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/03/28/sole-mate\"&gt;insists&lt;/a&gt; that he selected red because it is, among other things, &amp;ldquo;the color of passion&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;is channeling some of that class-consciousness by way of his iconic, and very expensive, red-soled stilettos.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"699\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/04/Louis_XIV_of_France-1/f34c9cd15.jpg\" width=\"630\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"caption\"&gt;Louis XIV in all his manly, red-soled glory (Wikimedia)&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Heels&amp;rsquo; status changed around the time of the French Revolution&amp;mdash;not necessarily because of the rebellion itself, but as a result of the same social forces that helped to bring it about. As Semmelhack argues in her book &lt;a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Heights_of_fashion.html?id=dpYOAQAAMAAJ\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heights of Fashion: A History of the Elevated Shoe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, France&amp;rsquo;s post-revolution society put a premium on practicality and reason. And, across Europe, the ideas of the expanding Enlightenment resented the heel for the same reason aristocrats had prized it: its inherent impracticality. (As a satirical poem from the time &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mode_in_Footwear.html?id=Vxez-N1HO5kC\"&gt;advised&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Mount on French heels, When you go to the ball&amp;mdash; &amp;rsquo;Tis the fashion to totter and show you can fall.&amp;rdquo;) The &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Heights_of_fashion.html?id=dpYOAQAAMAAJ\"&gt;Great Male Renunciation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; had begun.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Men&amp;rsquo;s heels, though, were also victims of a broader trend. &amp;ldquo;With the gradual rise of democracy and capitalism,&amp;rdquo; Valerie Steele, the director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told me, &amp;ldquo;not only did high heels for men, but also color in clothing for men, jewelry, decoration, lace&amp;mdash;all went out and became re-defined as being feminine rather than aristocratic.&amp;rdquo; Heels, because of that, &amp;ldquo;were now seen as effeminate: not acceptable for men to wear.&amp;rdquo; Indeed, when Napol&amp;eacute;on crowned himself emperor in 1804, he&lt;a href=\"http://www.wmagazine.com/culture/2014/09/killer-heels-exhibition-brooklyn-museum/photos/\"&gt; made a point of wearing flats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Napoleonic distaste for the heel endured, and expanded; it would be more than a century before men would dip their toes once more into heels, those &amp;ldquo;irrational,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;feminine&amp;rdquo; forms of footwear. Women, on the other hand&amp;mdash;who would of course be dismissed as irrational regardless of what they put on their feet&amp;mdash;continued, save for some dabbling in Classical-inspired flats in the early-18th century, to claim heels for themselves. The punishing paradox they represented back then&amp;mdash;heels treated as both requirements for feminine beauty and evidence of feminine frivolity&amp;mdash;will feel vaguely familiar today. As a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; article from 1871 (tellingly headlined &amp;ldquo;Make-believe Shoes&amp;rdquo;) &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Heights_of_fashion.html?id=dpYOAQAAMAAJ\"&gt;proclaimed&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Suffrage! Right to hold office! Show us first the woman who has independence and sense and taste enough to dress attractively and yet to walk down Fifth-avenue wearing &amp;hellip; a show which does not destroy both her comfort and her gait.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;That mainstream dismissal of heels continued on into the 20th century&amp;mdash;even as some men began experimenting with them again. In 1965, &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Heights_of_fashion.html?id=dpYOAQAAMAAJ\"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;ldquo;somewhat alarmingly, teenage boys are taking to high heels.&amp;rdquo; Those boys would be imitated by, among others, John Travolta, catching Saturday Night Fever in high-heeled boots; and by David Bowie, strutting in his inches-high platforms; and by Prince, rocking stilettos; and by the members of KISS, whose elaborately heeled boots became anthemic to rocking and rolling all night/partying every day.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The men&amp;rsquo;s forays into elevated footwear, however, were fleeting, and aimed more at making a point than making an enduring style. For the most part, men-in-heels has been relegated to rodeos and drag shows. (Think, today, of &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/us/politics/marco-rubios-shiny-boots-stir-up-the-presidential-race.html?_r=0\"&gt;the mockery recently leveled at former presidential candidate Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt; when he stepped out on the campaign trail in inch-high boots.) No matter how much gender equality we claim to have attained as a culture&amp;mdash;no matter how much of men&amp;rsquo;s fashion has become, in recent years, tighter and brighter and more flamboyant than it used to be&amp;mdash;heels have remained, by default and by design, womenswear. And they have, in that, retained some of the Enlightenment-era dismissals of feminine fashion as impractical and, indeed, irrational. &lt;i&gt;My thoughts on heels are very much the same as they were in the beginning: that they&amp;rsquo;re stupid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why do we wear them? They&amp;rsquo;re so painful. And pointless, really. You know, I really would like to urge everyone to stop it. Just stop it.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;- Emma Thompson&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;That is partly because of Roger Vivier and his introduction, in the 1950s, of the stilettos that managed to be at once futuristic and retrograde. The new shoe represented technological progress, via the thin heel of extruded steel that Vivier referred to as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://nypost.com/2015/01/25/the-history-of-high-heels-from-venice-prostitutes-to-stilettos/\"&gt;the needle&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;; it also, however, with its height and its relative skimpiness, represented a new form of conservatism. Here was the cult of domesticity&amp;mdash;the stuff born of Victorian ideals, the stuff that produced the ennui that Betty Friedan would later bemoan&amp;mdash;neatly embodied in footwear. Here was Cinderella&amp;rsquo;s glass slipper, tiny and magical and impossible, rendered as sartorial expectation. Here was a design that was decently well suited for wear upon the carpets and linoleums and constraints of the home; here was a design that, tellingly, was not well suited for navigating the world beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Stilettos, born of the porn of the 19th century, thus in the 20th adopted another dimension of male desire: the wish for loyal housewives&amp;mdash;for women who would always be home, waiting for you and, indeed, on you. Because in those shoes, they couldn&amp;rsquo;t do much else.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The stiletto briefly went out of style in the &amp;rsquo;60s and &amp;rsquo;70s, its dainty lines replaced with bold, stacked heels and very high platforms; by the &amp;rsquo;80s, however, it returned&amp;mdash;and came back taller than ever. And there it stayed. There was Tina Turner, icon-ing in stilettos. There was Madonna. There was Melanie Griffith, swapping sneakers for pumps as &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Girl\"&gt;Tess McGill&lt;/a&gt; arrived&amp;mdash;in every sense of the word&amp;mdash;in Manhattan. There, a little later, was Julia Roberts, in Vivian Ward&amp;rsquo;s&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Woman\"&gt; thigh-high&amp;mdash;and toothpick-heeled&amp;mdash;patent-leather boots&lt;/a&gt;. There was Naomi Campbell, in her Vivienne Westwoods. There was Jennifer Jason Leigh, whose &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_White_Female\"&gt;Hedra Carlson&lt;/a&gt; took the &amp;ldquo;little dagger&amp;rdquo; on her feet to its murderously logical conclusion. There was Carrie Bradshaw, running on heels and then tripping on them. And there was Big, finally, proposing to her not with a ring, but with &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dYLfQXjKw0\"&gt;a diamond-encrusted pair of Manolos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;And there, too, today, are Annalise Keating and Alicia Florrick and Claire Underwood and Selina Meyer, removing their heels and rubbing their aching feet after long days of bosslady-ing. There is Anne Hathaway&amp;rsquo;s Andy Sachs, the heroine of &lt;i&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/i&gt;, telegraphing her (d)evolution as a character through her willingness, and unwillingness, to wear stilettos. There is Hathaway&amp;rsquo;s Catwoman, in&lt;a href=\"http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1345836/quotes?qt=qt1746136\"&gt; a scene&lt;/a&gt; in 2012&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;The Dark Knight Rises&lt;/i&gt;, asked by a male adversary, &amp;ldquo;Do those heels make it hard to walk?&amp;rdquo; There she is, kicking him from behind and purring in reply, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Do they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"dropcap\"&gt;T&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;hey do. Just a little bit, but they do! Heels&amp;rsquo; failures as engineered footwear are precisely the reason Thesis Couture has more than 10,000 names on its waiting list: If heels can finally be made walkable&amp;mdash;not in a &amp;ldquo;standing around at a cocktail party&amp;rdquo; way, but in a legitimate, &amp;ldquo;living one&amp;rsquo;s life&amp;rdquo; way&amp;mdash;then that changes their politics. &amp;ldquo;The high heel is a mutable object&amp;mdash;it is something that we simply assign meaning to,&amp;rdquo; Semmelhack, the shoe historian, told me. And if you can take the hobble out of the heel, that in some sense reverses the meaning that hundreds&amp;rsquo; of years worth of history have assigned: heels as symbols, essentially, of a woman&amp;rsquo;s copious capacity&amp;mdash;and, indeed, a woman&amp;rsquo;s willingness&amp;mdash;to bear pain.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;And so while Thesis Couture&amp;rsquo;s promise of comfortable stilettos&amp;mdash;informed by an intimate knowledge of what it means and feels like to walk in heels&amp;mdash;is premised on fashion, it is rooted, too, in feminism. (There&amp;rsquo;s a reason Thesis &lt;a href=\"http://thesiscouture.com/wp-content/uploads/thesis_lookbook_ibook.pdf\"&gt;nicknamed its first lookbook&lt;/a&gt; the &amp;ldquo;THE BOOK of LEGENDS,&amp;rdquo; and a reason, too, that each of the 21 designs it presents&amp;mdash;the &amp;ldquo;Amelia Earhart,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Hua Mulan,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Serena Williams&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;is named for a pioneering woman.) Thesis, through its emphasis on ergonomics and engineering, is fighting against the Louboutinian logic that has been with us, in some form, for centuries: the assumption that heels are feminine not in spite of all they demand of their wearers, but because of it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/04/straightline/c4be199ee.jpg\" width=\"630\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit\"&gt;Kara Gordon / &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Singh and her colleagues, in other words, are hoping that their own contribution to the Heel Advice Industrial Complex will be to render all the tips and tricks that Michelle Phan and her fellow advice-offerers offer, finally, obsolete. The Thesis shoe is unsatisfied with &lt;a href=\"http://www.whowhatwear.com/how-to-make-heels-comfortable/\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who What Wear&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo;s advice&lt;/a&gt;, say, to &amp;ldquo;tape your third and fourth toes (counting from the big toe) together&amp;mdash;we recommend &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/1oAtmOE\"&gt;nude medical tape&lt;/a&gt; for a low-profile look, but Scotch tape works in a pinch&amp;mdash;to alleviate pain in the ball of your foot.&amp;rdquo; And with &lt;i&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Next Top Model&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo;s J. Alexander&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/gallery/8-high-heel-tips-from-fashion-week-pros#3\"&gt;suggestion that, when in heels&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;whenever and wherever you can, sit, sit, sit!&amp;rdquo; (and then: &amp;ldquo;cross your legs so that all can see your beautiful, fashion-forward, painful footwear&amp;rdquo;). And it is outright indignant with &lt;i&gt;Bustle&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/17355-8-ways-to-make-high-heel-shoes-comfortable\"&gt;conclusion&lt;/a&gt; that, if &amp;ldquo;stretching out your shoes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;using Moleskin&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to make walking in heels comfortable, then perhaps you should simply &amp;ldquo;change the way you walk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Thesis shoe, to be sure&amp;mdash;even after that first, extremely limited-edition line&amp;mdash;will be accessible only to a small percentage of women. While future lines will feature designs at varying price points (including $600 for an evening look and $900-$1,000 for red carpet-worthy stunners), the least expensive of them, Singh told me, will be a &amp;ldquo;day look&amp;rdquo; for $350. Even the cheapest won&amp;rsquo;t be cheap. But Singh also hopes that Thesis shoes, if they catch on with the broader public in the way the company&amp;rsquo;s waiting list suggests they might, will have a trickle-down effect. Singh is expecting that Thesis&amp;rsquo;s design will be imitated&amp;mdash;or, at least, that other designers will attempt that imitation. And that, all in all&amp;mdash;six provisional patents notwithstanding&amp;mdash;will be a good thing. Thesis&amp;rsquo;s broad goal, Singh told me, is to &amp;ldquo;fundamentally change the footwear industry and fundamentally raise the bar on how you make a good pair of shoes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Or, as Kelly Shapiro, Thesis Couture&amp;rsquo;s chief legal counsel, explained to me of the company&amp;rsquo;s broad ethos: &amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to see our sisters in pain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I did everything Fred did, only backwards and in high heels.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Ginger Rogers&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s notable that corsets, the devices that worked under the roughly heel-like auspices of &amp;ldquo;suffering for beauty,&amp;rdquo; were also hated by many doctors, loved by many men, loathed by many women, and tolerated by many more. They were the targets of many movements in favor of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_dress_reform\"&gt;rational dress&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; that arose, and died, in the 19th and early-20th centuries. Movements that, with convincing evidence on their side, accused corsets of &amp;ldquo;girl torture.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s notable as well, though, is that those movements were largely ignored by the broad public until fashion designers themselves began to create styles that de-emphasized women&amp;rsquo;s waists. Those designs brought with them a new implication, Valerie Steele told me: that women who kept wearing corsets despite the turn in fashion did so only in a vain attempt at insistent artifice. As Leigh Summers, the author of &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Bound_to_Please.html?id=vdx-Nzouh-kC\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bound to Please: A History of the Victorian Corset&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, explained it to me: &amp;ldquo;Older and overweight women probably continued to wear corsets well into the end of the 20th century&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;at which point &amp;ldquo;pantyhose ultimately spelled their doom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;And so there, maybe, is another tautology when it comes to heels: They will stay in style as long as we&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;we,&amp;rdquo; their wearers, &amp;ldquo;we,&amp;rdquo; their designers, &amp;ldquo;we,&amp;rdquo; their admirers&amp;mdash;say that is where they belong. There have been &amp;ldquo;rational dress&amp;rdquo; movements in footwear, too&amp;mdash;not just in the form of &lt;a href=\"http://www.feministtimes.com/a-feminist-in-high-heels-is-like-dawkins-in-a-rosary/\"&gt;feminist objections to heels&lt;/a&gt;, but also in the guise of ballet flats and sandals and even wedges and platforms, which offer height while sparing the foot the concentrated gravity that comes with the wearing of stilettos. Those movements, for the most part, have done very little to reverse, or even to dent, heels&amp;rsquo; popularity. As a representative from Zappos told me, &amp;ldquo;Heels are consistently a top-selling category for us, even as trends have shifted towards casual the past several years.&amp;rdquo; (She added: &amp;ldquo;Women will always have a need for heels. They are the ultimate feminine accessory whether in the office, a special occasion, or out for dinner.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;I regret binding my feet. I can&amp;rsquo;t dance. I can&amp;rsquo;t move properly. I regret it a lot. But at the time, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t bind your feet, no one would marry you.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Zhou Guizhen, survivor of foot-binding, 2007&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s also notable, though, is that we seem to have arrived at a moment of widespread uncertainty when it comes to the underlying &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;s of heels&amp;rsquo; wear. In 2015, the Cannes Film Festival &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/cannes-backlash-high-heels-emily-blunt-flat-shoes\"&gt;met outrage&lt;/a&gt; when its organizers were reported to have turned away women who weren&amp;rsquo;t wearing heels from its red carpet. The festival organizers denied the report, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t stop it&amp;mdash;flat-out rejections, all too literally!&amp;mdash;from inspiring a string of anti-heel invectives. &amp;ldquo;Everyone should wear flats, to be honest,&amp;rdquo; Emily Blunt &lt;a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-emily-blunt-flatgate-cannes-high-heels-flats-rule-20150519-story.html\"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be wearing high heels, anyway.&amp;rdquo; Kristen Stewart, who regularly wears sneakers on the red carpet, &lt;a href=\"http://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Why-Kristen-Stewart-Doesnt-Wear-Heels-32941753\"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; that while &amp;ldquo;in a photo, obviously, things look better wearing heels,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;in terms of just kicking around and actually, like, experiencing an entire night, heels limit me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Many more young stars&amp;mdash;which is also to say, many more young &amp;ldquo;influencers&amp;rdquo; and trendsetters&amp;mdash;have been &lt;a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/12/hate-high-heels_n_4584516.html\"&gt;reflecting that same ambivalence&lt;/a&gt;. At an awards gala in 2012, Lena Dunham walked onstage in a pair of metallic high heels; a few sentences into the acceptance speech she was giving, though, she paused. &amp;ldquo;I have to take my shoes off, you guys, I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=\"http://www.racked.com/2012/11/13/7703797/lena-dunham-took-off-her-shoes-at-glamours-women-of-the-year-awards\"&gt;she announced&lt;/a&gt;. And then: She did.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Emma Thompson, similarly, &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jan/25/comfortable-is-ok-flat-shoes\"&gt;took to the Golden Globes stage in 2014&lt;/a&gt; holding her Louboutins in one hand (and, in the other, a martini). &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken my heels off as a feminist statement really,&amp;rdquo; she declared, &amp;ldquo;because why do we wear them? They&amp;rsquo;re so painful. And pointless, really.&amp;rdquo; Jennifer Lawrence &lt;a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/05/22/cannes-flats-shailene-woodley-sofia-coppola/27656301/\"&gt;has called heels&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Satan&amp;rsquo;s shoes.&amp;rdquo; The supermodel Cara Delevingne, when asked what the worst part of being a model is, &lt;a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2277399/Cara-Delevingne-I-hate-high-heels-The-blonde-reveals-ups-life-worlds-wanted-model.html\"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;I hate high heels, more than anything.&amp;rdquo; Naomi Watts recently &lt;a href=\"http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2016/03/28/naomi-watts-new-beauty-cover-aging-botox/?xid=socialflow_twitter_peoplemag\"&gt;confessed&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;ldquo;I would never put on high heels unless I absolutely had to.&amp;rdquo; Miley Cyrus, in her song &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11SvDtPBhA\"&gt;Party in the U.S.A.&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; humblebrags about her &amp;ldquo;outsider&amp;rdquo; status in L.A.: &amp;ldquo;All I see are stilettos / I guess I never got the memo.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, womenfolk, as we once burned our bras could we not torch the footwear crucifying us?&amp;rdquo; Mary Karr &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/16/down-with-high-heels\"&gt;recently beseeched her fellow ladies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i&gt;New Yorker. &lt;/i&gt;She imagined the wonders that would follow that pump-pyre. &amp;ldquo;Our feet and spines will unknot, and high heels will fade from consciousness along with foot-binding and rib removal to shrink your waist.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Karr added: &amp;ldquo;The species may stop reproducing, but who the hell cares.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"dropcap\"&gt;W&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;hat does all that amount to? Will the heel, indeed, go the way of the corset and the bound foot&amp;mdash;an icon of femininity rendered, via the network of advances we tend to shorthand as &amp;ldquo;progress,&amp;rdquo; obsolete? Could it be that the feminine ideals of the past will lose their cachet to the current influence of the nameless, faceless &lt;a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/13306276-gone-girl\"&gt;Cool Girl&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;the girl who wears Chuck Taylors and chugs beer and shoots whiskey and, in general, is hot precisely because she doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to be? Could it be that we have reached a moment when women&amp;rsquo;s fashion, taking a cue from the casual, comfortable impulses of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/doonan/2011/11/the_rise_of_quiet_luxury_understated_chic_that_is_very_very_expensive_.html\"&gt;quiet luxurians&lt;/a&gt; and the coders of Silicon Valley, will do away with the high heel?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Or, alternatively: Could the technological advances that define Thesis Couture&amp;rsquo;s footwear render all of those questions moot? Will all the forces bearing down on the heel as it currently stands be absorbed into Thesis&amp;rsquo;s ballistics-grade polymer? Could it be that the arc of fashion really does bend toward comfort?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly&amp;mdash;but only possibly. This summer, Taylor Swift went on tour around the country and the world, performing for audiences of hundreds of thousands of people, many of them&amp;mdash;most of them&amp;mdash;young girls. Swift sang about confidence. She sang about romance. She sang about beauty. She sang the lyrics, &amp;ldquo;She wears high heels / I wear sneakers.&amp;rdquo; She did it all while clad in &lt;a href=\"http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2015/05/11/taylor-swift-stuart-weitzman-shoes-1989-world-tour/\"&gt;3.25-inch Stuart Weitzmans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/-6GL28Q37yI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>Arch Enemies</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/-6GL28Q37yI/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T06:30:00-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-478350</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[A new company is bringing the engineering savvy of rocket science to the design of the high-heeled shoe.

Rousseff, the leader of the center-left Workers Party, will now step down from her post as legislators prepare an impeachment trial against her that could last six months. Michel Temer, the vice president and and a member of the country&amp;#39;s largest political party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, will assume office.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Rousseff had vowed to fight to &amp;ldquo;the last minute,&amp;rdquo; and twice asked the country&amp;rsquo;s Supreme Court to intervene and stop the proceedings, but the justices refused. Rousseff has called impeachment proceedings a &amp;ldquo;coup&amp;rdquo; to remove her from power. Rousseff, who is halfway through her second term, is the first female president of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The vote was the latest development in a political saga that has captivated Latin America&amp;rsquo;s most populous nation this spring. Rousseff does not face corruption charges, but the lawmakers who led the effort to remove her she used accounting practices in 2014 to conceal a growing budget deficit. Rousseff has denied any wrongdoing, &lt;a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-brazil-impeachment-vote-20160417-story.html\"&gt;arguing&lt;/a&gt; that the practices her government employed are widely used. Rousseff&amp;rsquo;s opponents say the leader committed a &amp;ldquo;crime of responsibility,&amp;rdquo; an impeachable action under the Brazilian constitution.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Her opponents have also seized on her party&amp;rsquo;s involvement in the largest corruption scandal in Brazil&amp;rsquo;s history. Petrobras, the state-run oil firm, is under investigation for allowing a secret, decade-long operation involving bribes and kickbacks among company executives, politicians, and others. Rousseff is not being investigated in the scheme, but it had occurred while she served on Petrobras&amp;rsquo;s board of directors. Rousseff&amp;rsquo;s political mentor and former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;widely known as &amp;ldquo;Lula&lt;strong&gt;,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; and members of her party have been implicated.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;At the time of this week&amp;rsquo;s vote, Rousseff&amp;rsquo;s approval ratings were at &lt;a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-brazil-even-dilma-rousseffs-supporters-expect-her-removal-1462999615\"&gt;10 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Rousseff&amp;rsquo;s supporters have pointed out that many politicians who want her gone are dealing with corruption charges. Temer has been accused of involvement in an illegal ethanol-buying scheme. Eduardo Cunha, the former speaker of the lower house, faces charges in the Petrobras scandal. More than half of the members of a congressional impeachment committee are &lt;a href=\"http://en.mercopress.com/2016/04/07/rousseff-impeachment-vote-on-monday-but-outcome-uncertain-congress-remains-divided\"&gt;under investigation&lt;/a&gt; for corruption or other serious crimes. Twenty-four of 81 senators are being investigated for alleged corruption, 14 of them in the Petrobras scheme, according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/may/11/dilma-rousseff-impeachment-brazil-senate-vote?page=with:block-57334722e4b08056de8fa349#block-57334722e4b08056de8fa349\"&gt;cites&lt;/a&gt; the parliamentary watchdog newspaper &lt;em&gt;Congresso em Foco&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The impeachment battle has coincided with &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/03/brazil-economy-low-oil-prices-inflation\"&gt;the country&amp;rsquo;s worst recession in decades&lt;/a&gt;, a growing outbreak of the Zika virus, and preparations for the Olympic Games in Rio, which are three months away.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/4d_zVO-Velg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>End of the Road for Brazil\u2019s President?</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/4d_zVO-Velg/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T06:12:01-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482427</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[Senators voted to suspend Dilma Rousseff and begin an impeachment trial.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Global\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/brazil-impeachment-dilma-rousseff/482427/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Matt Ford</name>\r\n      <uri>http://www.thewire.com/authors/matt-ford/</uri>\r\n    </author>\r\n    <disqus:thread>\r\n      <disqus:shortname>thewire</disqus:shortname>\r\n      <disqus:identifier>mt482451</disqus:identifier>\r\n    </disqus:thread>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">\r\n\r\n \r\n&lt;figure class=\"lead-image\"&gt;\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &lt;img\r\n                src=\"http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/mt/2016/05/RTX2DW5S/lead_large.jpg\"\r\n                alt=\"Image \"\r\n                title=\"Italy\u2019s Civil Unions Battle\"\r\n            &gt;\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Italian legislators voted to legalize civil unions for same-sex couples on Wednesday, spurning fierce resistance by the Roman Catholic Church in favor of a growing consensus on LGBT rights in Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Italian Chamber of Deputies &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/world/europe/italy-gay-same-sex-unions.html\"&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt; 372 to 51 in favor of the bill, with 99 legislators abstaining. The Italian Senate previously approved it in February. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;has more details:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At the Trevi Fountain in Rome, people with rainbow flags gathered to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;It was a historic occasion for a nation that is still dominated by the Roman Catholic Church, which opposed the measure, and where traditional family norms are still strong. It was also a victory for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who supported the bill.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nearly every Western country has legalized same-sex marriage or some form of civil union for gays and lesbians. Italy was perhaps the most prominent exception, and the issue has generated significant controversy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;To compel allied legislators to vote for the bill, Renzi connected it to a motion of no confidence in his government, which he won.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s vote was a significant victory for gay and lesbian Italians, but not a sweeping one. Opposition from Catholic clergy pushed legislators to water down some of the bill&amp;rsquo;s protections. As &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/italy-mps-support-introduction-same-sex-civil-unions\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, the final version has numerous shortcomings:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A draft article that would have granted gay couples the right to adopt their partners&amp;rsquo; biological children was dropped. While adoption has not been ruled out, family judges will decide on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Amid concern that civil unions would be too similar to marriage, references to a need for faithfulness were removed. Gay couples will be able to take each other&amp;rsquo;s names and inherit each other&amp;rsquo;s residual pension rights, but critics say the new rules fall short of the legal protection offered to same-sex couples in other European countries, as well as Canada and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Another influential factor in the bill&amp;rsquo;s passage was the European Court of Human Rights. The supranational tribunal &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33611955\"&gt;ruled last July&lt;/a&gt; that by not offering legal protections to civil unions or marriages by gay couples, Italy was in violation of Europe&amp;rsquo;s human-rights convention.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/5CBfXvE4KrU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n    <title>Italy\u2019s Civil Unions Battle</title>\r\n    <link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/5CBfXvE4KrU/\" rel=\"alternate\" />\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T01:10:47-04:00</published>\r\n    <id>tag:thewire.com,2016:50-482451</id>\r\n    <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[The Italian Parliament voted to extend the right to same-sex couples on Wednesday.]]></summary>\r\n    <category term=\"Global\" />\r\n  <feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/italy-civil-unions-battle/482451/</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n</feed>\r\n",
