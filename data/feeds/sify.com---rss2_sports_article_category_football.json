I\u2019m delighted for what has happened. The final will be perfectly even, but now we're going to enjoy this, it\u2019s an important day.\"</p><p>For City, however, it was a tame ending to their European campaign as they failed to force Madrid keeper Keylor Navas into a single save.</p><p><img src=\"http://im.sify.com/sifyhome2011/images/may2016/b3.jpg\"><br></p><p>While Bale enjoyed good fortune in forcing the goal, the Wales international nonetheless produced a blockbuster European performance.</p><p>He tirelessly closed down City's midfield in a lung-busting display and was Madrid's biggest threat in attack, providing exquisite passes and sending a header crashing against the bar in the second half.</p><p>City's chances of shutting out Madrid were stung when their influential captain Vincent Kompany limped off the pitch with what appeared to be a muscle problem in the ninth minute, capping a frustrating season overshadowed by injuries for the centre back.Madrid seized the moment soon after. The energetic Dani Carvajal skipped past Kevin De Bruyne down the right and slipped the ball round the back of City's defence and into the path of Bale.He made for the near post before his cross spun off the outstretched leg of Fernando and looped into the net off the woodwork.</p><p><img src=\"http://im.sify.com/sifyhome2011/images/may2016/b5.jpg\"><br></p>Madrid grew stronger after the goal and a shot from Ronaldo flew over the bar, while Pepe put the ball in the net only to see his effort ruled out correctly for offside.<p><img src=\"http://im.sify.com/sifyhome2011/images/may2016/b8.jpg\"><br></p><p>Despite Madrid's dominance, City could have levelled just before the break when De Bruyne found Fernandinho on the left of the area, and the Brazilian's left-footed shot clipped the near post.</p><p>It was one of few scares for Madrid, who bossed the second half as they did the first.</p><p>Ronaldo spurned three chances to double the lead and Bale's header smashed the bar.</p><p><img src=\"http://im.sify.com/sifyhome2011/images/may2016/b7.jpg\"><br></p><p>\"We could easily be in the final but they managed the game well, and got a very lucky goal,\" said City keeper Joe Hart.</p><p>\"They've beaten us with a very lucky goal but it is what it is.\"</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/brilliant-bale-helps-real-tame-city-to-reach-cl-final-news-football-qffkXkddbigga.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/atletico-oust-bayern-to-reach-champions-league-final-news-football-qfemvtigbdhgh.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Wed, 04 May 2016 12:21:19 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Atletico oust Bayern to reach Champions League final]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qfemurahddagc.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[Atletico Madrid reached the Champions League final on away goals on Tuesday after a 2-1 defeat at Bayern Munich, in which both sides missed a penalty, with the exhilarating tie finishing 2-2 on aggregate.<p>Atletico will play in the showpiece match for the second time in three seasons against either city rivals Real Madrid, who beat them in the 2014 final, or Manchester City, with the second semi-final scheduled for the Bernabeu on Wednesday.</p><p>Bayern's exit ended their hopes of claiming a treble with Atletico going through to the May 28 final at the San Siro in Milan after winning the first leg 1-0 last week.</p><p>The Bavarians went ahead with a Xabi Alonso free kick just past the half-hour and could have scored again three minutes later but Thomas Mueller's penalty was saved by Jan Oblak.</p><p><b><img src=\"http://im.sify.com/sifyhome2011/images/may2016/2.jpg\"><br></b></p><p>Atletico levelled through Frenchman Antoine Griezmann's seventh goal of this season's competition in the 54th, meaning Bayern would need at least two more goals to progress.</p><p><b><img src=\"http://im.sify.com/sifyhome2011/images/may2016/7.jpg\"><br></b></p><p>Bayern's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski set up a dramatic finale with his 74th minute goal before Atletico's Fernando Torres had an 85th minute spot kick saved by Manuel Neuer.</p><p>But it made no difference in the end as Bayern suffered a third straight elimination by a Spanish team at this stage in their three seasons under Pep Guardiola.</p><p>\"They were better, but we scored an away goal, which was important. We need to keep grounded and first of all think of the Liga before the final,\" said Griezmann, whose side are level on points with leaders Barcelona in the Spanish title race.</p><p>\"We're delighted. It was difficult, a really hard game, we had a great opponent in front of us and we had to both defend and try to score. That's what we did,\" he added. <b><img src=\"http://im.sify.com/sifyhome2011/images/may2016/8.jpg\"></b><br></p><p><b>Bitter Pill</b></p><p>Guardiola, in his final Champions League home game at Bayern before his move to Manchester City for next season, started with defender Jerome Boateng, back from a three-month injury break on Saturday, and Franck Ribery, himself back from injury.</p><p>With a newly-discovered intensity, the Bavarians were dominant in the first half, successfully navigating through the Spaniards' high pressing game and grabbing their first chance with a Lewandowski header in the 12th minute.</p><p>\"We are a bit lost for words,\" said Neuer. \"We played great football today, did everything we set out to do but it is bitter not to be travelling to Milan for the final.\"</p><p>Atletico keeper Oblak was kept busy in the first half, with the tables turned and Bayern doing the pressing -- having 12 shots compared to Atletico's two by the half hour.</p><p>Alonso finally got the hosts a deserved lead in the 31st minute, his low free kick clipping Atletico's Jose Maria Gimenez to cancel out Atletico's first-leg advantage.</p><p>Bayern pushed for a second goal and thought they would have it when Javi Martinez was brought down by Gimenez in the box to earn a penalty three minutes later.</p><p>But Oblak saved Mueller's spot kick and Atletico stunned the home crowd after the break when Griezmann linked up with Torres and charged through to beat Neuer with a fine finish.</p><p>With Bayern now on the backfoot and needing at least two more goals to advance, Atletico grew bolder and Juanfran's shot on the hour sailed narrowly wide.</p><p>Lewandowski put Bayern back in front on the night with a close-range header to spark a dramatic finale but they could not find another goal and their Champions League hopes were over. </p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/atletico-oust-bayern-to-reach-champions-league-final-news-football-qfemvtigbdhgh.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/is-leicesters-5000-1-upset-the-greatest-sporting-shock-news-football-qfdn3tfeahfec.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Tue, 03 May 2016 13:29:19 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Is Leicester's 5,000-1 upset the greatest sporting shock?]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qfdmX9hfhfjhh.jpg\"/><description/><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/is-leicesters-5000-1-upset-the-greatest-sporting-shock-news-football-qfdn3tfeahfec.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/update-1-uk-stocks-factors-to-watch-on-april-21-news-equity-qevmuqgheabec.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 21 Apr 2016 06:50:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[UPDATE 1-UK Stocks-Factors to watch on April 21]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>(Adds futures, company news items)</p>  <p>April 21 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index is seen opening up 15points, or 0.2 percent, on Thursday, according to financial bookmakers, withfutures up 0.12 percent ahead of the cash market open.

Andresen.</p>  <p>The ethics panel will also look into allegations of human rights abuses in Qatar's building sector, Malaysia's electronics goods industry, and textile factories in some Asian countries, Andresen told Reuters.</p>  <p>The fund is the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, owning 1.3 percent of all listed company equity on earth. As of the end of last year it owned shares in 9,050 firms worldwide.</p>  <p>It is forbidden by law from investing in firms that produce nuclear weapons or anti-personnel landmines, or are involved in serious and systematic human rights violations, among other ethical criteria.</p>  <p>Norway's parliament has set a new mandate from this year to restrict investment in companies that emit excessive climate changing gases. Andresen said his panel was still looking into the criteria for such judgements but its first recommendations on climate criteria could come by the end of the year.</p>  <p>Some 66 companies have so far been excluded from the wealth fund on ethics grounds, and two are under observation, including, since January, Brazil's state oil company Petrobras, under scrutiny for alleged corruption.</p>  <p>\"Most of the corruption cases come from the industry studies within defence, telecoms and energy. Those three (sectors) seem to keep us very busy,\" Andresen, the council's chairman, said in an interview. \"We will of course look into other companies, should we be made aware of them.\"</p>  <p>The Council on Ethics makes recommendations to the central bank on firms which may be in breach of the fund's ethics guidelines. It is now examining 14 corruption cases, including Petrobras.</p>  <p>Based on the council's recommendations, the central bank board instructs the fund's management whether to exclude companies from the fund. The board can also put firms under observation to allow them to fix the problem. A key factor is the risk that an ethics breach will be repeated in future. </p>  <p>The risk of corruption increases in the energy, defence and telecoms sectors as they more often involve large contracts between parties that can withhold information based on internal national security directives, Andresen said.</p>  <p>\"We were especially surprised with what we found in the arms industry. It seems that the absence of corruption was the exception and not the norm,\" said the 54-year-old Norwegian investor, owner of private investment vehicle Ferd.</p>  <p>Andresen declined to comment specifically on Petrobras, but speaking generally, he said: \"Companies should aspire to be far better ... They should not try to guess what is the least amount of good behaviour that is expected.\"</p>  <p>Across all sectors, he expected the number and frequency of recommendations to the central bank's board to increase as the council concludes the different sector studies it has begun.</p>  <p>\"We did recommend one company for exclusion last week, and there are others that we are working on right now. Some of these companies are quite large, so the (central) bank may decide to undertake some type of ownership interaction,\" he said.</p>  <p/>  <p>TEXTILE, CONSTRUCTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE</p>  <p>Asked about the apparent irony in looking at climate change for a fund that earns nearly all its wealth from Norway's oil and gas industry, Andresen said: \"We don't get involved in politics and therefore we don't question the criteria. Whichever criteria the politicians give us, we will use.\" </p>  <p>Andresen said the council would look at \"a broad set of industries\" including the oil and gas sector over climate change, and had not yet concluded which factors to analyse to determine what is acceptable.     </p>  <p>\"I don't think there is a reason to avoid looking at oil and gas companies. But they are not going to be the only ones by far,\" he said, speaking at the council's office in central Oslo.</p>  <p>\"We think that there might be some exclusions towards the end of the year within the climate criterion.\"</p>  <p>Next month the council will receive a first report on the construction industry in Qatar. Construction companies working in neighbouring countries will be under review too, he said.</p>  <p>Also under scrutiny will be electronics goods manufacturers in Malaysia.</p>  <p>The council will look at workers rights in the Indian and Bangladeshi textile industries, after looking at Cambodia and Vietnam last year.</p>  <p>\"In earlier studies of textile production facilities, we have been confronted with forced overtime, loss of bonus when legally sick, possible child labour, safety issues and the integrity of the construction of the (plant) building,\" he said.</p>  <p>Another target will be the environmental damage made by the chemical industry. The council is looking at \"less than ten\" companies in this field, he said.</p>  <p>The council, although independent, is collaborating closely with the fund, which has its own ethical targets, such as children's rights, human rights and water management. They are working together on the textile industry.</p>  <p>\"They are focusing on the buyers' side, the big companies within the fund, while we engage with the smaller companies where the potential breach is happening on the ground,\" he said.</p>  <p/>  <p> (Editing by Peter Graff)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/exclusive-ethics-watchdog-for-norways-830-billion-wealth-fund-sees-increase-in-bans-on-firms-news-others-qdlqxUcjcbhjh.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/nigerian-man-kills-friend-over-ronaldo-messi-debate-news-football-qdhx0Vfjijbbg.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Mon, 07 Mar 2016 23:26:57 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Nigerian man kills friend over Ronaldo-Messi debate]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/pi2n8tcebdjeh.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<p> In a bizarre incident, a Nigerian man killed his friend in Mumbai after an argument over whether Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo was the best footballer in the world spiralled out of control.</p><p>According to goal.com, police said that Obinna Michael Durumchukwa, 34, was celebrating his birthday with his 22-year-old friend Nwabu Chukwuma when they started to argue about the Barcelona and Real Madrid stars.</p><p>Police inspector Kiran Kabadi said that Durumchukwa hurled a glass at Chukwuma which missed and hit the wall.

Vallecano in La Liga on Thursday after goal-machine Lionel Messi scored his 35th hat-trick.Ivan Rakitic opened the scoring, Messi caught up with Real Madrid\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo on 35 trebles in all competitions and Arda Turan completed the rout, with Turkey's captain scoring his first goal for the club since joining from Atletico Madrid.Barca's victory, which saw them beat the undefeated record Real Madrid had held since the 1988/89 season, restored an eight-point lead at the top over Atletico with 11 matches to go.Atletico beat visiting Real Sociedad 3-0 on Tuesday, while third-placed Real Madrid are again 12 points off the pace after a 3-1 win at Levante on Wednesday.Barca were helped by the fact that Rayo lost defender Diego Llorente to a red card three minutes before halftime for a foul on Rakitic before Manuel Iturra was also sent off in the 67th for bringing down Sergio Busquets in the area.Busquets was felled from behind going for the rebound after a Messi free kick came back off the bar but Luis Suarez's penalty was saved by Juan Carlos, Barcelona's ninth miss from 18 penalties in all competitions this season.\"It's a strange situation (missing penalties),\" the Catalan side's midfield general Andres Iniesta said. \"We mustn't let it bother us while everything is working as well as it is.\"The reasons are many (to explain) why the team continues in this positive dynamic (but) the league isn't over, there are lots of points still to take,\" he was quoted as saying on the As website (www.as.com).Rakitic scored in the 22nd minute by tapping the ball home when it fell to him after Juan Carlos spilt a high cross.Messi finished off a fine one-two with Neymar a minute later for his first goal and Llorente was shown the red card three minutes before halftime for a foul on Rakitic.Messi scored his second in the 53rd after a shot by Suarez came back off the post and completed his hat-trick in the 72nd after darting through the defence from midfield.Rayo got a consolation in the 57th through Manucho's header after Bebe, at the far post, nodded a cross from the right into the middle as the two ex-Manchester United players combined.]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/messi-hat-trick-barca-record-35-match-unbeaten-run-news-football-qdemBLeejdibd.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/afghan-boy-receives-signed-jersey-from-messi-news-football-qczujmebabfhe.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Thu,
