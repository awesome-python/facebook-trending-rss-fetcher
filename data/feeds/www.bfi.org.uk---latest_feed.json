Directed by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd846cd70\">Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven</a> and co-written by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd661bb26\">Alice Winocour</a> (Disorder), <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/56427bade6075\">Mustang</a> tells the tale of sisters Sonay, Selma, Ece, Nur and Lale from within the confines of their aunt and uncle\u2019s house. The combination of their blossoming sexuality and natural boisterousness sends shockwaves of panic through their community, and so it is decided that each of the girls will be married off as soon as possible (though not if the girls themselves have anything to say about it).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to watch a close clan of women severed by the strictures of patriarchy. However, though the film deals with a model of patriarchy specific to Turkish/Muslim culture, it&#8217;s worth noting that Mustang is a French production and filtered through the western perspectives of its writers/director. By choosing to highlight the archaic spectacle of arranged marriage, the film occasionally ends up flattening issues of cultural context to make its point.</p>\n<p>Are the sisters in Mustang the victims of an intensely patriarchal culture or are they cursed? From the Lisbon sisters\u2019 untimely deaths in The Virgin Suicides (1999) to the menstrual maladies that befall Ginger and Brigitte in Ginger Snaps (2000), there\u2019s certainly no shortage of tragic narratives about ill-fated sisters in cinema. In some films (My Neighbour Totoro, Practical Magic) curses simply signal magic at play (or is it witchcraft?); in others, they provide an opportunity to enact sisterly solidarity (Frozen).</p>\n<p>To toast Mustang\u2019s UK release and to celebrate the five women at its heart, here are 10 excellent films that celebrate the good, the bad and the magic truths of sisterhood.</p>\n<h3>\u201cWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201d (1962)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0<span>Robert Aldrich</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.39259259259\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/what-ever-happened-to-baby-jane-1962-001-joan-crawford-bette-davis-00n-1e5.jpg?itok=K7JuummV\" alt=\"\u201cWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201d (1962)\" title=\"\u201cWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201d (1962)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.39259259259\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/what-ever-happened-to-baby-jane-1962-001-joan-crawford-bette-davis-00n-1e5.jpg?itok=K7JuummV\" alt=\"\u201cWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201d (1962)\" title=\"\u201cWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201d (1962)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba119154b\">Robert Aldrich</a>\u2019s dark psychological thriller is considered a camp <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ba805f8\">classic</a>, though the comedy here is laced with cruelty. The bratty Baby Jane Hudson is a vaudeville child star; her reserved older sister Blanche an actress with more serious credentials \u2013 until she gets into a mysterious car accident that paralyses her from the waist down. Baby Jane is left as her primary carer, with the two of them almost totally alone in a crumbling, Sunset Blvd-style mansion.</p>\n<p>The film settles in once both sisters are well past their prime, concerning itself with the psychological warfare Baby Jane (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1416e18\">Bette Davis</a>) enacts on her crippled sister (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f484830\">Joan Crawford</a>). The bitterness between the pair is made all the more palpable by Aldrich\u2019s casting choices, which played on the longstanding real-life rivalry between Davis and Crawford (as well as seeing two of Hollywood\u2019s most glamorous leading ladies made up to look like haggard old women).</p>\n<h3>Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Woody Allen</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.54545454545\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hannah-and-her-sisters-1986-002-mia-farrow-barbara-hershey-dianne-wiest.jpg?itok=ygNXFwm9\" alt=\"Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)\" title=\"Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.54545454545\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hannah-and-her-sisters-1986-002-mia-farrow-barbara-hershey-dianne-wiest.jpg?itok=ygNXFwm9\" alt=\"Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)\" title=\"Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>This warm romantic comedy is <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ef3006f\">Woody Allen</a>\u2019s most human film by a clear country mile. The jokes are as barbed as ever, but the tone is gentler, and more optimistic than in most of Allen\u2019s filmography. Starring <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9efa0e7d\">Mia Farrow</a> as the eponymous Hannah, and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba16516f3\">Barbara Hershey</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1cee234\">Dianne Wiest</a> as her respective sisters, it follows the ups and downs of their relationships with each other and with men. It feels satisfying to sit alongside these women as they exercise their neuroses by chewing the fat over big meals. Set in Allen\u2019s beloved New York City in the autumn, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7234f9b8\">Hannah and Her Sisters</a> paints the highs and lows of family life with novelistic detail.</p>\n<h3>My Neighbour Totoro (1988)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\">Director\u00a0Hayao Miyazaki</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77674418605\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/my-neighbour-totoro-1988-004-satsuki-mei-in-magical-forest.jpg?itok=iODFKl7Z\" alt=\"My Neighbour Totoro (1988)\" title=\"My Neighbour Totoro (1988)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77674418605\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/my-neighbour-totoro-1988-004-satsuki-mei-in-magical-forest.jpg?itok=iODFKl7Z\" alt=\"My Neighbour Totoro (1988)\" title=\"My Neighbour Totoro (1988)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Satsuki and her four-year-old sister Mei have moved house with their father.

Austen is best known for her witty commentaries on love, money and social class, though sisterly tensions crop up throughout her novels \u2013 from Pride and Prejudice\u2019s clan of eligible bachelorettes to the three sisters at the heart of Mansfield Park. In <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7da4a645\">Sense and Sensibility</a>, sense and sensibility are the Dashwood sisters (played by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1c2f296\">Emma Thompson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bab399a5b\">Kate Winslet</a> respectively), two women who fall into unexpected financial ruin. Thompson, who wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay, adds her own feminist flair to Austen\u2019s story by making explicit the problems faced by women who neither worked nor inherited their own money.</p>\n<h3>Soul Food (1997)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><span><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0George Tillman Jr</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.78412256267\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/soul-food-1997-001-vanessa-williams-vivica-fox-lia-long.jpg?itok=B7xZFxw8\" alt=\"Soul Food (1997)\" title=\"Soul Food (1997)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.78412256267\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/soul-food-1997-001-vanessa-williams-vivica-fox-lia-long.jpg?itok=B7xZFxw8\" alt=\"Soul Food (1997)\" title=\"Soul Food (1997)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bb0836df6\">George Tillman Jr</a>\u2019s comedy <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7fe2d412\">drama</a> pivots around three sisters: straightlaced attorney Teri (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1d06c54\">Vanessa L.

With Big Mama on her deathbed for the majority of the film, it occasionally finds itself slipping into the realm of melodrama, but that\u2019s no bad thing (nor is it inaccurate, as anyone from a big family will confirm).</p>\n<h3>Practical Magic (1998)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Griffin Dunne</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.79727095517\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/practical-magic-1998-001-nicole-kidman-sandra-bullock_0.jpg?itok=fWbptvV0\" alt=\"Practical Magic (1998)\" title=\"Practical Magic (1998)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.79727095517\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/practical-magic-1998-001-nicole-kidman-sandra-bullock_0.jpg?itok=fWbptvV0\" alt=\"Practical Magic (1998)\" title=\"Practical Magic (1998)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba8cefbdd\">Sandra Bullock</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba7ebf669\">Nicole Kidman</a> are witches \u2013 and estranged sisters \u2013 in this underrated romantic comedy. With all potential love interests doomed to die, Sally (a typically uptight Bullock) resigns herself to a lonely life of solitude, busying herself with maternal duties and rescuing her sister Gillian (Kidman, replete with knee-high boots and a saucy snake tattoo) from an abusive, redneck boyfriend. Sure, it\u2019s silly \u2013 especially the scene that sees Bullock and Kidman dancing goofily with their aunts (played by Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing, no less) while drunk on \u201cmidnight margaritas\u201d to Harry Nilsson\u2019s 1971 hit \u2018Coconut\u2019. But it\u2019s charming too, especially in its suggestion that a life without men doesn\u2019t have to be totally lonely.</p>\n<h3>The Virgin Suicides (1999)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0<span>Sofia Coppola</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.52604611443\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/virgin-suicides-the-1999-001-kirsten-dunst-a-j-cook-hanna-hall-leslie-hayman-chelse-swain-00m-vey.jpg?itok=AjOvcOJr\" alt=\"The Virgin Suicides (1999)\" title=\"The Virgin Suicides (1999)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.52604611443\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/virgin-suicides-the-1999-001-kirsten-dunst-a-j-cook-hanna-hall-leslie-hayman-chelse-swain-00m-vey.jpg?itok=AjOvcOJr\" alt=\"The Virgin Suicides (1999)\" title=\"The Virgin Suicides (1999)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>A visual reference for hipster teenagers everywhere, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2baad44b98\">Sofia Coppola</a>\u2019s dreamy adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc25beb81\">Jeffrey Eugenides</a>\u2019 bestselling novel manages the rare feat of improving upon its source material. The Lisbon sisters are a quintet of spellbindingly beautiful blondes in Picnic at Hanging Rock-style white dresses, whose protective parents stop them from listening to rock music and dating boys, eventually driving them to their individual suicides. The sisters rebel against the way they are perceived at home and at school, taking solace in the fact that they at least have each other.</p>\n<p>Set against the backdrop of small-town 70s Americana and shot by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba9a243e0\">Edward Lachman</a>, it\u2019s as much a period piece as Coppola\u2019s later Marie Antoinette (2006).

When Ginger gets her period (Carrie-style), it\u2019s accompanied by hair growth, backache and bloodthirsty horniness \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s pretty much the same as being a werewolf.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b83848bfb\">Ginger Snaps</a>, screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc4c82f8e\">Karen Walton</a> explores what happens when growing up means growing apart \u2013 and when it doesn\u2019t. Ginger leaves her late-blooming sister behind as she enters the wild world of puberty, but it\u2019s Brigitte who is the film\u2019s unsung heroine, casting aside her natural reserve and rescuing her sibling in an act of sisterly solidarity.</p>\n<h3>The Hunger Games (2012)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Gary Ross</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.78025034771\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hunger-games-the-2012-003-jennifer-lawrence-willow-shields-hug.JPG?itok=spVcbwXj\" alt=\"The Hunger Games (2012)\" title=\"The Hunger Games (2012)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.78025034771\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hunger-games-the-2012-003-jennifer-lawrence-willow-shields-hug.JPG?itok=spVcbwXj\" alt=\"The Hunger Games (2012)\" title=\"The Hunger Games (2012)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The first instalment of the dystopian drama sets a chain of events in motion.

This isn\u2019t the first time Lawrence has assumed the role of sensible big sister on the big screen (her breakout role in the unshowy Winter\u2019s Bone saw her charged with similar on-screen responsibilities). However, the scale and scope of the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4fac1d63c4505\">Hunger Games</a> universe gives Lawrence the opportunity to sink into the psyche of a single-minded survivor who is prepared to sacrifice her life for her sister \u2013 but is determined to return home safely.</p>\n<h3>Our Little Sister (2015)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0<span>Hirokazu Koreeda</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49349263921\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/our-little-sister-2015-003-four-sisters-at-seaside-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=aln_o9OH\" alt=\"Our Little Sister (Umimachi Diary, 2015)\" title=\"Our Little Sister (Umimachi Diary, 2015)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49349263921\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/our-little-sister-2015-003-four-sisters-at-seaside-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=aln_o9OH\" alt=\"Our Little Sister (Umimachi Diary, 2015)\" title=\"Our Little Sister (Umimachi Diary, 2015)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Sisters Sachi (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd2819a41\">Haruka Ayase</a>), Yoshi (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd23dba51\">Masami Nagasawa</a>) and Chika (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bdea8b479\">Kaho</a>) live together in their late grandmother\u2019s house in Kamakura, leading their separate lives with relative ease.

Campaigning on the issue has been intensifying, with luminaries such as <a href=\"http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2ba1bd8b8c\">Meryl Streep</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bdc3ea124\">Jennifer Lawrence</a> speaking out about <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11924312/Meryl-Streep-I-still-experience-sexism-and-get-paid-less-than-men.html\">their own</a> <a href=\"http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=a5b04a26aae05a24bc4efb63e&amp;id=64e6f35176&amp;e=1ba99d671e#wage\">experiences</a>, and <a href=\"/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/festivals/cannes-2012-hello-boys\">the yearly problem</a> of <a href=\"/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/festivals/cannes-2016/club-class-cannes-2016-selection\">a lack of female directors at Cannes</a> brings with it a fresh round of debate. Yet while Cannes 2016\u2019s 21-title Competition lineup features just three female directors, and only seven women amongst its 56 Official Selection films, to point the finger at such festivals is to ignore the fact that their decisions are a consequence, not a cause, of the industry\u2019s inherent problem with women.</p>\n<p>Published in early May, Directors UK\u2019s extensive report on the current state of female directors confronts this issue head on, exploring how \u2013 and, more importantly, why \u2013 female filmmakers are being shortchanged by the industry. It not only confirms that the situation is dire but highlights the fact that, in some areas, things are getting progressively worse.</p>\n<p>These dispiriting findings are compounded by two further reports, one carried out by a European Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded team at the University of Southampton and one by the European Women\u2019s Audiovisual Network (EWA), which reveal that that the dismal state of affairs is replicated across all sectors of the industry, and throughout Europe.</p>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<h4>Cut out of picture</h4>\n<p>The Directors UK report, entitled <a href=\"https://www.directors.uk.com/news/cut-out-of-the-picture\">Cut Out of the Picture: A study into the gender and inequality amongst directors within the UK film industry</a> and authored by industry analyst Stephen Follows, examines a decade\u2019s-worth of data to understand how female filmmakers are faring in the industry at large. Looking at all 2,591 films made in the UK between 2005 and 2014, and taking in data from BFI, HMRC and box-office revenues along with critical and audience reception from the IMDb and review-aggregate sites, it paints a pretty bleak picture.</p>\n<p>While the report\u2019s top line finding that just 13.6 per cent of working film directors in the UK over the decade of study were women may be unsurprising, other revelations are more eye-opening. It systematically picks apart the arguments often used to explain the lack of female directors, finding that audiences and critics tend to prefer female-directed films, that such films don\u2019t fare any worse at the box office and that, crucially, women are actively pursuing top level careers in the industry \u2013 proven by the finding that women make up 50.1 per cent of film students in the UK, and account for 49.4 per cent of entry-level runners and production assistants.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.678145695364\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/cut-out-of-the-picture-directors-uk-report-2016-shrinking-female-opportunities-infographic-ORIGINAL_0.png?itok=sRnDAxcq\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"0.678145695364\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/cut-out-of-the-picture-directors-uk-report-2016-shrinking-female-opportunities-infographic-ORIGINAL_0.png?itok=sRnDAxcq\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>          <span class=\"copy\">Credit: from Directors UK\u2019s report Cut Out of the Picture: A study into the gender and inequality amongst directors within the UK film industry</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<h4>No lack of ambition</h4>\n<p>The fact that women are actively pursuing film-industry education and careers in equal numbers as men is also correlated by the EWA report <a href=\"http://www.ewawomen.com/en/news/where-are-the-women-directors-in-european-films-key-findings.html\">Where are the women directors in European films?</a> Published in February 2016, the report is a result of two years\u2019 research across seven European countries (Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and UK), and finds that there is a significant shortfall from the proportion of women entering the industry (44 per cent) to that of female directors actually working within it (just 24 per cent).</p>\n<p>The resulting observation is clear: the lack of female filmmakers cannot be attributed to a lack of drive, but to the fact that they are being overlooked by the industry once they are working within it.</p>\n<p>This is further validated by Directors UK statistics regarding the number of female directors at each stage of a career, from shorts and low-budget films to mid-range movies and studio blockbusters. The report\u2019s statistics on the disappearance of women are stark: while 16.1 per cent of directors of films budgeted at less than \u00a3150,000 were female, women accounted for just 3.3 per cent of films with a budget of \u00a330 million.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe workforce is 50/50 at the point where people enter the industry,\u201d Directors UK Andrew Chowns <a href=\"http://www.screendaily.com/features/hidden-gender-analysing-the-directors-uk-report/5103295.article\">explained to Screen International</a>. \u201cBut at every stage of their career as a director, women are being removed to such a progressive extent that by the time you get to major features [the number of women] is absolutely negligible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.97734294542\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/avengers-assemble-2010-001-cast-on-stage-at-comic-con-creative-commons-sa-licence.jpg?itok=2TzEPSjZ\" alt=\"The cast of The Avengers Assemble (2010) assemble at Comic Con\" title=\"The cast of The Avengers Assemble (2010) assemble at Comic Con\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.97734294542\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/avengers-assemble-2010-001-cast-on-stage-at-comic-con-creative-commons-sa-licence.jpg?itok=2TzEPSjZ\" alt=\"The cast of The Avengers Assemble (2010) assemble at Comic Con\" title=\"The cast of The Avengers Assemble (2010) assemble at Comic Con\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">The cast of The Avengers Assemble (2010) assemble at Comic Con</span><br />\n              <span class=\"copy\">Credit: Ronald Woan CC BY-SA 2.0 </span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<h4>Public funding support</h4>\n<p>It\u2019s not only on major features where women are being sidelined, however, The Directors UK report makes the surprising discovery that they are also being increasingly overlooked in favour of their male counterparts by the UK\u2019s major public funders.</p>\n<p>In the decade of study, just 21.7 per cent of films receiving public funding had a female director. Worse, public funding support for films with female directors decreased significantly over that period, from 32.9 per cent in 2008 to just 17 per cent in 2014.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the report looks at films in production up until summer 2014, before the BFI introduced their <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/announcements/bfi-obligates-supports-lottery-funding-recipients-reflect-diversity-uk\">Three Ticks</a> diversity initiative, since been revised and refocused as the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/about-bfi/policy-strategy/diversity\">BFI Diversity Standards</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the 2015-16 full funding year the number of BFI-supported feature films directed by women rose to 34 per cent, or <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/bfi-film-fund-slate-20152016\">11 out of the 32 directors across the films we funded</a>, our aim being that with further effort this will continue to rise,\u201d said BFI Film Fund director Ben Roberts in response to the findings.</p>\n<p>This lack of public funding support for female filmmakers isn\u2019t confined to the UK, however. The EWA report highlights a similar trend across the seven countries studied, finding that 84 per cent of available public funding resources go into films that are directed by men.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.67989417989\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/wutherin-heights-2011-004-kathy-sideways-in-fog.jpg?itok=UetZeC4K\" alt=\"Wuthering Heights (2011)\" title=\"Wuthering Heights (2011)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.67989417989\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/wutherin-heights-2011-004-kathy-sideways-in-fog.jpg?itok=UetZeC4K\" alt=\"Wuthering Heights (2011)\" title=\"Wuthering Heights (2011)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Wuthering Heights (2011)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<h4>Sector-wide problem</h4>\n<p>While the prime focus of the gender debate may be female directors, women are woefully underrepresented across all sectors of the industry. This has been highlighted in both the Directors UK report, which finds that the majority of women can be found within artistic departments such as costume, production and make-up design, and a new report funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, whose authors, based at the University of Southampton, are spending four years researching the contemporary history of women working in the UK film industry.</p>\n<p>Their most recent research, <a href=\"http://www.southampton.ac.uk/cswf\">Calling the Shots</a>, looks at the numbers of men and women working in the key roles of director, writer, producer, executive producer, cinematographer and editor across all films produced in the UK during 2015. They found that women made up only 20 per cent of individuals across all of these roles and that, shockingly, 25 per cent of all films studied had no women at all in any of those roles.</p>\n<p>When women were present in those key roles during 2015, they accounted for very small numbers, making up just 13 per cent of directors, 20 per cent of screenwriters, 27 per cent of producers, 18 per cent of executive producers, 17 per cent of editors and 7 per cent of cinematographers.</p>\n<p>The report also finds that just 7 per cent of those women were of Black, Asian or Ethnic Minority identity, meaning that BAME women made up less than 1.5 per cent of all key personnel on UK films in production in 2015.</p>\n<p>Both Directors UK and the University of Southampton agree that films with women in senior decision-making roles, such as directors or producers, are far more likely to have females in other key positions. The latter report, for example, found that 74 per cent of films with a female director also had a female producer, and that 69 per cent of female screenwriters worked on a film with at least one female producer.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5392508979\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/lff-2015-carol-press-conference-phyliss-nagyrooney-mara-todd-haynes-cate-blanchett-elizabeth-karlsen-christine-vachon.JPG?itok=pFVGkKpa\" alt=\"Carol (2015) screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, actor Rooney Mara, director Todd Haynes, actor Cate Blanchett and producers Elizabeth Karlsen and Christine Vachon at a London Film Festival press conference\" title=\"Carol (2015) screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, actor Rooney Mara, director Todd Haynes, actor Cate Blanchett and producers Elizabeth Karlsen and Christine Vachon at a London Film Festival press conference\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5392508979\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/lff-2015-carol-press-conference-phyliss-nagyrooney-mara-todd-haynes-cate-blanchett-elizabeth-karlsen-christine-vachon.JPG?itok=pFVGkKpa\" alt=\"Carol (2015) screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, actor Rooney Mara, director Todd Haynes, actor Cate Blanchett and producers Elizabeth Karlsen and Christine Vachon at a London Film Festival press conference\" title=\"Carol (2015) screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, actor Rooney Mara, director Todd Haynes, actor Cate Blanchett and producers Elizabeth Karlsen and Christine Vachon at a London Film Festival press conference\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Carol (2015) screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, actor Rooney Mara, director Todd Haynes, actor Cate Blanchett and producers Elizabeth Karlsen and Christine Vachon at a London Film Festival press conference</span><br />\n              <span class=\"copy\">Credit: Gareth Cattermole for Getty Images</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<h4>Call to action</h4>\n<p>There surely can be no arguing with the findings of all three reports or, indeed, the many other similar studies. The European Audiovisual Observatory\u2019s 2014 <a href=\"http://www.obs.coe.int/en/-/pr-female-directors-report-2014\">Female Directors in European Film Productions</a>, for example, found that just 16.3 per cent of European films made between 2003 and 2012 were directed by a woman. And <a href=\"http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/files/2016%20Independent_Women_Report.pdf\">recent research</a> from the Center for the Study of Women in Television in Film at San Diego State University found that women accounted for just 19 per cent of directors, writers, producers, editors and cinematographers across the 250 top-grossing movies in the USA during 2015.</p>\n<p>In the face of such shocking, and oft-replicated, numbers there can also be no arguing with their shared assertion that proactive change is needed to redress the balance, particularly as it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that the industry is unable \u2013 if not unwilling \u2013 to course correct on its own.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact the awareness of gender equality has been widespread, and much discussed, for well over a decade, the status quo has remained resolutely unchanging. The Directors UK report attributes this to the industry\u2019s \u2018unconscious systemic bias\u2019 towards men, which is subscribed to by its primary gatekeepers and decision-makers and results in a perpetual skewing towards male filmmakers behind the camera and male stories in front of it.</p>\n<p>That report is bold in its claim that only institutional change can make a difference, suggesting a target of 50 per cent gender parity for all public funding of film by 2020 and the development of UK tax relief to establish formalised diversity requirements. These recommendations have been met with widespread support, with many pointing to the success of the Swedish Film Institute which achieved <a href=\"http://www.filminstitutet.se/en/about-us/swedish-film-institute/gender-equality/\">its target gender parity</a> in public funding in 2014 and have been reaping the rewards at festivals and the box office ever since.</p>\n<p>\u201cEqual numbers of men and women enter this industry, but women are relentlessly squeezed out,\u201d says Kate Kinninmont, Chief Executive of Women in Film and Television UK in response to Calling the Shots. \u201cBlack and Minority Ethnic (BAME) women have the hardest time of all. It\u2019s the film industry itself which suffers from this, with narrowing of its vision and an impoverishment of its creativity. Sweden has acted successfully to remedy this by ensuring that public money in the industry is divided fairly. Canada and Australia are following suit. It\u2019s time for the UK to act.

Reggie [Beck] had taken me on to the sound stage where they were shooting tests for the ghost scenes. Olivier was dressed in a white bathrobe, his face and hands were blackened and in his mouth he had a lit bulb which was connected to a battery tied to his back underneath the robe.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe stood surrounded by technicians, watching them intently while they were preparing the shot [\u2026] At first I couldn\u2019t understand the reason for the blackened face and the light bulb in the mouth, but then it dawned on me that Olivier wanted the ghost to appear like a negative image. It was a daring idea and I wondered how it would look on screen.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the crew watched the rushes it became obvious that \u201cOlivier in the negative was not impressive\u201d and the idea was dropped.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.28026592022\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hamlet-1948-014-three-men-standing-next-to-cannon-00n-atz.jpg?itok=hlisuOxD\" alt=\"The ghost scene\" title=\"The ghost scene\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.28026592022\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hamlet-1948-014-three-men-standing-next-to-cannon-00n-atz.jpg?itok=hlisuOxD\" alt=\"The ghost scene\" title=\"The ghost scene\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">The ghost scene</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<h3>On the swirling fog</h3>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.750582072177\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/hamlet-1948-015-laurence-olivier-00o-1g2.jpg?itok=TupxehVi\" alt=\"Hamlet (1948)\" title=\"Hamlet (1948)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"0.750582072177\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/hamlet-1948-015-laurence-olivier-00o-1g2.jpg?itok=TupxehVi\" alt=\"Hamlet (1948)\" title=\"Hamlet (1948)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Hamlet (1948)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAll the night scenes were meant to include moving patches of fog. This effect was produced with a chemical substance which was blown on to the set and then dispersed with the help of wind machines. If anything went wrong, if an actor blew his lines or the camera did not move smoothly, the shot had to be retaken. But before another take was possible, the remaining fog had to be extracted. This made for very slow shooting and created severe hold ups. To add to it, the unit started to complain that the chemical fog made them nauseous.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter a week of painfully little progress, Olivier had to give up on the idea of shooting with the fog on set. It was decided that the fog was to be superimposed on the shots afterwards. For this purpose one whole hour of swirling fog was shot in front of a black velvet backing and handed to me, because I was the one who had to take care of ordering the superimpositions.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me this hour of swirling fog turned into a nightmare. I did my best to match sections of the fog in the right part of the screen, going in the right direction. Larry who in his thoroughness had sat through the screening of the whole hour of swirling fog, had a much better memory than mine. He was say to me sweetly: \u2018Darling, don\u2019t you remember that piece of fog that sinks slowly on the right of the screen and then moves along to the left? I think that would look even better here\u2019.

Larry\u2019s costume, the tight black hose with the velvet cod-piece, had been the cause of complaints \u2013 visits to the men\u2019s room were always problematic. Now Roger presented him for his birthday with a lovely blue velvet one which had \u2018To pee or not to pee!\u2019 and \u2018What, hath this thing appeared again tonight?\u2019 embroidered on it. This was shown around the [studio] floor and naturally caused great hilarity.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>On cutting the film</h3>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt could be said that the actual job of editing Hamlet was a relatively easy one. Most of the film was shot in lengthy sequences, the cuts between them had been decided on during planning sessions in Italy and appeared in the script [Olivier had opted for long takes so as not to distract the audience\u2019s attention from Shakespeare\u2019s verse dialogue].</p>\n<p>\u201cThis nevertheless presented a peculiar problem. Because the cuts were so few and far between, each cut was obvious and could cause a visual jolt to the spectator unless it happened at the right psychological moment. The right psychological moment could be dictated by a movement, a piece of action or by the rhythm of Shakespearean speech. In either case it was a matter of finding the exactly right frame to cut from one scene to another, and a fraction of a second (there are 24 frames to a second of film) could make all the difference between a jarring and a smooth cut. Only rarely was I able to show that I could do a real job of editing a scene by combining a number of shots to create drama.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.767142457319\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/hamlet-1948-017-lairence-olivier-portrait-off-set-00n-810.jpg?itok=VPT-ygLa\" alt=\"Hamlet (1948)\" title=\"Hamlet (1948)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"0.767142457319\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/hamlet-1948-017-lairence-olivier-portrait-off-set-00n-810.jpg?itok=VPT-ygLa\" alt=\"Hamlet (1948)\" title=\"Hamlet (1948)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Hamlet (1948)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Cranston did devise the means for Olivier to have the camera rush up a winding tower staircase, transporting the audience to Hamlet\u2019s turret-top delivery of \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d. The special effects team were unable to create this shot effectively but Cranston continued to experiment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI suddenly had an idea. A great many of the shots started with a camera panning over flights of empty stairs. I took one of these shots and made a loop (a ring of film) of it and ran it through the moviola [a film viewing machine used for editing]. Lo and behold, the repeated movement made the stairs look like a winding staircase.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cranston cut together a number of different takes and sped up the action by taking out frames. Olivier was thrilled with the result.</p>\n<p>Cranston was incredibly (and rightly) proud of her work on Hamlet and went on to have a successful career as an editor. She worked with directors such as <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1a33c04\">Otto Preminger</a>, on <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b4e041c\">Saint Joan</a> (1957) and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a60f47c\">Bonjour Tristesse</a> (1958), and again with Olivier, who was so pleased with her editing of Hamlet that he invited her back to work on <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b44a05a\">Richard III</a> (1955).</p>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\">Helga Cranston (as Helga Keller) was also interviewed by Gordon McMullan for Women Making Shakespeare: Text, Reception and Performance (2013).

It\u2019s been widely noted for some time now that Thierry Fr\u00e9maux and his team have been pulling further ahead of rival A-list festivals in terms of being able to cherry-pick movies by the top directors, and most would agree that in the main competition that has once again proven to be the case.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/american-honey-2016-001-kids-on-pavement.jpeg?itok=uJBhjtGS\" alt=\"American Honey (2016)\" title=\"American Honey (2016)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/american-honey-2016-001-kids-on-pavement.jpeg?itok=uJBhjtGS\" alt=\"American Honey (2016)\" title=\"American Honey (2016)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">American Honey (2016)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Many of those competing for the Palme d\u2019Or are now Cannes regulars, though that certainly doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019ll be no surprises. Nor does it mean that the official festival as a whole is playing it safe. In the Un Certain Regard strand, just as in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight (which has found space for films by such established talents as Paul Schrader, Marco Bellocchio, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Pablo Larra\u00edn) and the Critics\u2019 Week, there are plenty of first and second features by relatively unknown names.</p>\n<p>Britain is pretty well represented by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba8692f5d\">Ken Loach</a>\u2019s I, Daniel Blake, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bb0a920a1\">Andrea Arnold</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/5553f53f5ebd8\">American Honey</a> and \u2013 in the Un Certain Regard selection \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bbbd697bf\">David Mackenzie</a>\u2019s Hell or High Water, though geographically speaking the last two are both set in the US. The Loach, typically, isn\u2019t, and would seem to be a timely reflection on the current condition of Britain\u2019s welfare state; if memory serves, he\u2019s said it is his last film, but then again he\u2019s said that before. Whatever, as he approaches his 80th birthday in June, it\u2019s heartening indeed to see Ken competing once more in Cannes.</p>\n<p>The other English-language contestants are also by Cannes regulars. Opening the festival, and out of competition, is <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ef3006f\">Woody Allen</a>\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Society, with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bca2aaa1e\">Kristen Stewart</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc43e6158\">Jesse Eisenberg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bb608d1a5\">Steve Carell</a> and other big names. Those who can recall an earlier Allen Cannes opener \u2013 the lamentable <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b864767ea\">Hollywood Ending</a> (2002) \u2013 are undoubtedly hoping the new film will be a worthier choice to kick off the festival.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49438202247\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/paterson-2016-001-couple-in-bed-sleeping.jpeg?itok=ayTCtTew\" alt=\"Paterson (2016)\" title=\"Paterson (2016)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49438202247\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/paterson-2016-001-couple-in-bed-sleeping.jpeg?itok=ayTCtTew\" alt=\"Paterson (2016)\" title=\"Paterson (2016)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Paterson (2016)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The other American directors in competition are perhaps more dependable: <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba16bfdab\">Jim Jarmusch</a>\u2019s Paterson (with Adam Driver as a poet bus-driver) sounds highly appealing, while <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd9e5d409\">Jeff Nichols</a>\u2019 Loving (about a mixed-race couple in 50s Virginia and once more starring <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc388882f\">Michael Shannon</a>) sounds as if it\u2019s considerably less fanciful than his Berlin-premiered Midnight Special. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ef40ed0\">Sean Penn</a> is back after a lengthy absence with The Last Face, a political drama set in Africa, while Denmark\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bbc7b3704\">Nicolas Winding Refn</a> has set his latest genre film The Neon Demon in LA. This one \u2013 a horror movie \u2013 doesn\u2019t star Ryan Gosling but <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bcb236dc5\">Elle Fanning</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bcb7ade19\">Christina Hendricks</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba2e8fb67\">Keanu Reeves</a>.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the French are well represented by Cannes regulars, though it must be said that if there are to be any surprises they might just be found here.

Initially, it stalks the trail of a new film production by European auteur Oliver Laxe, trekking the Atlas mountains and undergoing physical hardship. But Bowles\u2019 earlier vision threatens to take over as director Laxe is kidnapped by his own cast, throwing the viewers\u2019 already confused expectations into disarray. Rivers\u2019 film highlights the politics of filmmaker tourism and, by way of its documentary codes, questions whose film is actually being made here, and even what that film is. Each shot in this entropic stew stands as an enigmatic fragment in and of itself \u2013 there\u2019s something akin to a magical spell being cast here.</p>\n<p>As this viewer stills chews over the power of this bold, elliptical new work, we look at the history of British experimental feature films by way of 10 examples; at one level implicitly considering the connections between each film but at another highlighting the differences and sense of possibilities that come each time you start from a new and different map. Some are by people who identify or identified as \u2018artists\u2019, others are, in conventional terms, simply non-commercial. It represents a rich area of British filmmaking that while admittedly more well known and accessible than it was, still deserves a lot more \u2013 and more frequent \u2013 digging up and exposing to the light. Like The Sky Trembles&#8230;, the films below often use documentary codes and work in the grey areas between fact and fiction.</p>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\">William Fowler</span></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/ben-rivers-films-influenced-sky-trembles\">Ben Rivers: the films that influenced The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Borderline (1930)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Filmmaker</strong>\u00a0<span>Kenneth Macpherson</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.29060451566\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/borderline-1930-001-woman-with-knife-00n-pyx.jpg?itok=ikNWcfie\" alt=\"Borderline (1930)\" title=\"Borderline (1930)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.29060451566\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/borderline-1930-001-woman-with-knife-00n-pyx.jpg?itok=ikNWcfie\" alt=\"Borderline (1930)\" title=\"Borderline (1930)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bc5b9e4\">Borderline</a> offers a unique insight into the filmic obsessions of the UK\u2019s privileged Bohemian set in the 1920s. Directed by Scottish artist and writer <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9faa3807\">Kenneth Macpherson</a>, it features a cast including <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f428580\">Paul Robeson</a> (already a celebrity in his own right) and his wife <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba2d41621\">Eslanda</a>, as well as fellow contributors to Close-up, an early intellectual film journal.</p>\n<p>The story follows a group who one suspects are much like the actors themselves, presenting a tale that touches upon the taboo subjects of homosexuality, miscegenation, racial discrimination, dispossession and migration in a nameless location (though actually set and shot around a residence in Switzerland). But rather than its complex themes, it\u2019s the ambition of this innovative, elliptical film that have endured.

A product of the activism around rights for women in the 1970s, the film takes female relationships as its subject, as well as being made by women who were involved in the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b95142874\">London Women&#8217;s Film Group</a>.</p>\n<p>Repeated retellings expose the ways in which the fairytales pattern heterosexual romantic and generational relationships, making male lovers into heroes, female lovers into heroines and mothers into witches. However, as the film goes on and the story gets reframed in film noir, melodrama and essay film style, the logic of the fairytale is undone, ending with a joyful final sequence showing women making and enjoying music together.

An experiment in walking as much as an experiment in filmmaking, his 2015 film <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/55df265c87841\">By Our Selves</a> focuses on these elements through an emphasis on the psychogeography of a landscape. It follows in the footsteps of the poet, John Clare, whose madness leads him to walk 80 miles over four days from Epping Forest to Northamptonshire. K\u00f6tting frames Clare&#8217;s tragic disintegration not by recreating period details from his original walk, but by partaking in the walk itself and framing the modern topographical changes as the poet&#8217;s own instability: a madness of pylons.</p>\n<p>Clare&#8217;s neuroses manifest in the cacophony of Ballardian motorways, the hum of wind turbines and, eventually, through K\u00f6tting himself as a straw bear anchoring his walk \u2013 the filming process daring to become the ultimate of Clare&#8217;s many delusions. K\u00f6tting is a landscape punk of the Derek Jarman school of experimental DIY, yet with the same ethnographic curiosity of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f725f46\">Margaret Tait</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba16525a7\">Werner Herzog</a>.

As Hills herself explained to me the morning after the Beat Girl screening, however, that very particular background made its contribution to the forthright, credibly petulant performance she delivered on screen.</p>\n<p><strong>For all the film\u2019s slightly disreputable status, your performance in Beat Girl provides us with pretty much the first believable teenager on British screens. How did that come about?</strong></p>\n<p>Everything in that part was incredibly real to me. I wasn\u2019t acting at all, that\u2019s why there\u2019s a constant flow of fury. She so wants to express herself but when you\u2019re young you don\u2019t know how to do things like that, so she\u2019s constantly pushing all the wrong buttons.</p>\n<p>I recognised so many things about Jennifer, because there was a large part of myself which was so frustrated and annoyed. I\u2019d lived in so many countries by that point and spoken so many languages, it was as if I was just a piece of baggage. I saw the film again just recently for the first time since I was 16, and it was actually quite upsetting.

As an interloper from Paris, how did you fit in?</strong></p>\n<p>In those days, you had to have a special card from RADA before you could even act in films. I didn\u2019t have that; the producers got one for me. It was all so stultified in Britain compared to what they were doing in France, where Godard would just haul people off the streets. And I think that explains why the actors in British films were often older than the young people\u2019s parts they were supposed to be playing.</p>\n<p>But they all brought their own history with them. Adam Faith was from quite humble beginnings, but you could tell he was terribly ambitious, especially where music was concerned, and he was often huddled in conversation with John Barry. He was also terribly in love with Shirley Anne. He would end up in her dressing room next to mine and my mother had to make excuses for the squeaking noises we\u2019d hear coming through the walls.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/hills-gillian-album-cover.jpg?itok=ZxzAAgNg\" alt=\"A French four-track EP from 1965\" title=\"A French four-track EP from 1965\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/hills-gillian-album-cover.jpg?itok=ZxzAAgNg\" alt=\"A French four-track EP from 1965\" title=\"A French four-track EP from 1965\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">A French four-track EP from 1965</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Oliver Reed was very ambitious too: he told me his uncle <a href=\"http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2ba1a6cade\">Carol Reed</a> had gotten him the part, but he was really determined to make the most of it. He made sure you were looking at him, the way he moved.</p>\n<p><strong>After Beat Girl you signed for Barclay Records in Paris and became one of the female artists in France who started singing American-influenced pop songs rather than the traditional chanson style. Was that an easy transition?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh God, French is such a disaster for pop songs. It takes so long to say anything, and somehow it just doesn\u2019t have the right sound.</p>\n<p>I used to dread getting these texts I had to sing. They\u2019d take something like The Shirelles\u2019 track Mama Said, which is a great rock \u2019n\u2019 roll title, and turn it into some silly ditty about dancing the twist. But, you see, you had to know English in order to understand how bad the French was, and the writers were all getting royalties so they\u2019d just churn this stuff out.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I started writing my own songs \u2013 and why Serge Gainsbourg is such a hero in France, because he was the one to write real pop songs, to loosen it all up.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/blowup-1966-012-david-hemmings-with-gillian-hills-and-jane-birkin-in-studio.jpg?itok=b1cJjYNC\" alt=\"Hills with David Hemmings and Jane Birkin in Blowup (1966)\" title=\"Hills with David Hemmings and Jane Birkin in Blowup (1966)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/blowup-1966-012-david-hemmings-with-gillian-hills-and-jane-birkin-in-studio.jpg?itok=b1cJjYNC\" alt=\"Hills with David Hemmings and Jane Birkin in Blowup (1966)\" title=\"Hills with David Hemmings and Jane Birkin in Blowup (1966)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Hills with David Hemmings and Jane Birkin in Blowup (1966)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Was taking a fairly scandalous role in Blowup \u2013 with </strong><a href=\"http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b9ee1e843\">Jane Birkin</a><strong>, the rolls of purple paper and no clothes \u2013 a way of saying goodbye to all the fluffy French pop you\u2019d been doing?</strong></p>\n<p>When I talked to Antonioni, at first I had no inkling he\u2019d ever use me; it was just a lovely chat with this wonderfully talented person.

I got the smallest bottle in the shop and downed it in the loo before we went on. Jane was so nervous, I saw the make-up people covering the red blotches which had come out on her chest.

Stanley was very serious, and his crew absolutely revered him. I loved his sense of lighting, the way he lit what was actually a real council flat with a white perspex box flooding in. But it was really hot, and that made the boa constrictor rather lively\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.56288156288\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/clockwork-orange-a-1971-006-malcolm-mcdowell-in-record-shop-with-gillian-hills-and-second-girl.jpg?itok=vdL5wvup\" alt=\"Hills in A Clockwork Orange (1971)\" title=\"Hills in A Clockwork Orange (1971)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.56288156288\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/clockwork-orange-a-1971-006-malcolm-mcdowell-in-record-shop-with-gillian-hills-and-second-girl.jpg?itok=vdL5wvup\" alt=\"Hills in A Clockwork Orange (1971)\" title=\"Hills in A Clockwork Orange (1971)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Hills in A Clockwork Orange (1971)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Because Alex keeps a very large snake in the drawer\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>We were bouncing around on the bed, and <a href=\"http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b9ee24886\">Malcolm McDowell</a> was so funny, we laughed so much. But we did realise at one point that the snake was actually under the bed while a lot of this was going on. You know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re on a film set: you just assume that someone will be there to sort it out. We assumed it had been well fed, but Malcolm, who was a bit scared of snakes, wasn\u2019t such a trusting individual on that score.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure we shot another scene with the snake. I was there for about two weeks. But that\u2019s what happens in film: you eliminate what\u2019s not essential.</p>\n<p><strong>In contrast to those brief but memorable appearances, the TV adaptation of The Owl Service presumably offered something a bit more challenging in terms of performance?</strong></p>\n<p>I just lived it. It was the way I approached all my parts. Again, I felt very close to the role of Allison, because I\u2019d lived such a cooped-up life with my mother. I knew what it was like to feel restricted, and the kids in that book are brought up not to realise they can look after themselves, so they\u2019re being manipulated by the adults.</p>\n<p>Actually, the parts really should have been played by much younger children, but that\u2019s what makes the whole thing so unbelievably odd. It\u2019s perturbing. It\u2019s almost another Turn of the Screw.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.672409002501\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/demons-of-the-mind-1971-001-gillian-hills-portrait-under-sunlit-tree-00n-vw1.jpg?itok=VKXsFkUH\" alt=\"Hills in Demons of the Mind (1971)\" title=\"Hills in Demons of the Mind (1971)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"0.672409002501\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/demons-of-the-mind-1971-001-gillian-hills-portrait-under-sunlit-tree-00n-vw1.jpg?itok=VKXsFkUH\" alt=\"Hills in Demons of the Mind (1971)\" title=\"Hills in Demons of the Mind (1971)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Hills in Demons of the Mind (1971)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p><strong>You had further roles afterwards in A Clockwork Orange, obviously, but also Hammer\u2019s </strong><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a8a7183\">Demons of the Mind</a><strong>, and a Spanish horror film </strong><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b749ddaca\">The Killer Wore Gloves</a><strong>, all of which required a certain amount of nudity. Did the parts on offer contribute to your decision to stop acting in the mid-70s?</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s very strange when you go to an audition and suddenly you\u2019re asked to strip down to your underwear, like I did for <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba12aa342\">Juan Bosch</a>\u2026 and also at the casting session for A Clockwork Orange. We were all sitting outside and these girls were coming out absolutely traumatised. You were treated in a way which was very dehumanising.</p>\n<p>But that wasn\u2019t the case all the time. I remember, years later, after I\u2019d moved to New York to become an illustrator, I bumped into <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9eea78b2\">Anthony Page</a> at the Whitney. He\u2019d directed me in the film of John Osborne\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ad0b7dc\">Inadmissible Evidence</a>, and offered to get me some more parts, but by then my mind was made up never to go back. He said I was a good actress, which really touched me, because he was a very respected director.</p>\n<p><strong>And the decade you spent as an illustrator was by no means negligible, since you did the covers for a lot of high-profile best-sellers including Peter Benchley\u2019s The Deep and Virginia Andrews\u2019 Flowers in the Attic\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>Apparently, I\u2019m a cult. Those covers became a part of people\u2019s lives, even though I didn\u2019t even take a credit until the last couple of years when I knew I was going to stop.</p>\n<p>I worked in watercolours and I put all my emotions into them. Simon <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Schuster called me their mascot since so many of the books did quite well, though the only author who ever wanted to meet me was D.M. Thomas, because I was doing The White Hotel. We had a wonderful conversation about Jung and Freud, though I had a suspicion I knew more about them than he did.</p>\n<p><strong>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a conversation which started out with Beat Girl and ended up at The White Hotel\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, and Mad Men as well. You know, I went viral after Jessica Par\u00e9 sang my old French hit Zou Bisou Bisou at Don Draper\u2019s birthday party. The same key, the same rhythm, and she sang it so prettily.</p>\n<p>I was in Havana, of all places, where Zucchero, one of the people my husband Stewart manages, was recording a new album with Don Was. His keyboard player Peter Vettese had become so intrigued by that song that he asked if I would consider doing something again, so I went to the Caymans, stared at the sea and started writing again, thinking back to those years from 11 to 19. We hope to have the album out later in the year.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what happens when you combine passion and curiosity. Those two things have always propelled me. I don\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u2018boredom\u2019.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/interviews/gillian-hills-beat-girl</link>\n   <author>Trevor  Johnston</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/beat-girl-1959-003-gillian-hills-amidst-record-sleeves-00n-tzl_1000x750.jpg?itok=DYmAzeEZ\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[From Beat Girl to Mad Men: the life of Gillian Hills]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/features/ben-rivers-films-influenced-sky-trembles</guid>\n   <pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\n   <title>Ben Rivers: the films that influenced The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning artist and filmmaker Ben Rivers explains how films by directors including Fassbinder and Pasolini fed into his visionary new film set in the heat and dust of Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"rss-content-container\"><p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.6501650165\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/sky-trembles-and-the-earth-is-afraid-and-the-two-eyes-are-not-brothers-the-2016-003-tin-can-man-sunset.jpg?itok=Q3fa4ND0\" alt=\"The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers (2015)\" title=\"The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers (2015)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.6501650165\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/sky-trembles-and-the-earth-is-afraid-and-the-two-eyes-are-not-brothers-the-2016-003-tin-can-man-sunset.jpg?itok=Q3fa4ND0\" alt=\"The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers (2015)\" title=\"The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers (2015)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers (2015)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<div class=\"content-information\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/the-sky-trembles/?sb=screenings-uk#screenings-uk\">Find screenings for The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Some years ago, I started thinking about joining the small and relatively unsung genre of behind-the-scenes films. This may have come about through reflection on my own practice as a filmmaker, questioning the urge to create worlds, and the obsessiveness that can cause you to disregard other aspects of life. Filmmaking consumes my time, and my whole life revolves around thinking about them, travelling to make them, editing for months in dark rooms, working on soundtracks, and then travelling to show them. It makes sense to me that, at some point, I would want to directly make a film about this obsessive construction.</p>\n<p>For my film <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/563be307df33e\">The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers</a>, I wanted to move among different realms of reality \u2013 storytelling, songs, observation of a film being made, fiction \u2013 so that, in the end, the viewer is uncertain about where the fiction begins and ends. There were a number of films that I thought about while developing the project that were either observational documentaries about films being made or fictional recreations of a film set. What ties them all together is that they each show the darker side of filmmaking and its repercussions. I\u2019m interested in the question of why filmmakers want to expose the dark side of filmmaking. There is something perversely compelling about seeing someone who is a mirror version of yourself being taken down a road of obsession and disaster, finding what at the end? Here are five films that influenced my process of thinking about the film.</p>\n<h3>Vampir Cuadecuc (1971)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> Pere Portabella</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.38501628664\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/cuadecuc-vampir-1971-002-opening-coffin.jpg?itok=LzPRhdxU\" alt=\"Vampir Cuadecuc (1971)\" title=\"Vampir Cuadecuc (1971)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.38501628664\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/cuadecuc-vampir-1971-002-opening-coffin.jpg?itok=LzPRhdxU\" alt=\"Vampir Cuadecuc (1971)\" title=\"Vampir Cuadecuc (1971)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>This film was one I kept coming back to, because in many ways it was closest to what I had in mind \u2013 to make a film of another film, but for the boundaries of what is real and what is set-up to be uncertain and uneasy. It\u2019s an extremely beautiful and eerie behind-the-scenes film, showing the making of Count Dracula, a low-budget horror by B-movie maestro <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9eebdc28\">Jess Franco</a>. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba5d10fb3\">Pere Portabella</a> keeps the nightmare to a general sense of unexplained dread. It\u2019s a very complicated political film, without being in any way dogmatic. The only words spoken are at the end, when <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f466c12\">Christopher Lee</a> reads the final passage from Dracula \u2013 which was one reason why I filmed <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/563be3082173b\">Oliver Laxe</a> reading the beginning of a <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba65db92a\">Paul Bowles</a> story at the start of my film.</p>\n<p>The soundtrack of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7828a81d\">Vampir</a> was made by fellow Catalan artist <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc133c8f0\">Carles Santos</a>, which has a powerful effect on moving the film away from being read as a documentary. I asked Carles if I could reuse some of the soundtrack for both The Sky Trembles&#8230; these sounds form a bookend to my film, playing over ominous-looking taxis in the desert and the end credits.</p>\n<h3>The Last Movie (1971)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director </strong>Dennis Hopper</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49377593361\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/last-movie-1971-001-00n-61c-dennis-hopper.jpg?itok=H8w2uNFD\" alt=\"The Last Movie (1971)\" title=\"The Last Movie (1971)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49377593361\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/last-movie-1971-001-00n-61c-dennis-hopper.jpg?itok=H8w2uNFD\" alt=\"The Last Movie (1971)\" title=\"The Last Movie (1971)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f644089\">Dennis Hopper</a> is an extremely underrated filmmaker, and this is <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7378be4e\">his most underrated film</a>. It\u2019s not such a surprise that the studio suppressed it, because it\u2019s such a radical piece of filmmaking \u2013 moving freely back and forth through time and space, between layers of fiction that leave you as discombobulated as the main character, played by Hopper. The scenes of locals recreating the whole script, but with fake cameras, are one of the best comments on movie violence I can think of. This film was a big influence in thinking about how to keep the viewer in a state of uncertainty about the veracity of what they are seeing. It may be kind of messy, but that\u2019s a reason to love it, because things get messy.</p>\n<h3>Burden of Dreams (1982)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> Les Blank</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/burden-of-dreams-1982-001-werner-herzog-jungle.jpg?itok=O2vKfLpt\" alt=\"Burden of Dreams (1982)\" title=\"Burden of Dreams (1982)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/burden-of-dreams-1982-001-werner-herzog-jungle.jpg?itok=O2vKfLpt\" alt=\"Burden of Dreams (1982)\" title=\"Burden of Dreams (1982)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Like <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7b438bfe\">Hearts of Darkness</a> (about the making of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b69562aa2\">Apocalypse Now</a>), <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b69612f7d\">this documentary</a> achieves everything that the film it\u2019s about hopes to achieve and something more. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba16525a7\">Herzog</a> is Fitzcarraldo, struggling against nature in the Amazon, surrounded by plants and animals that are simply out to get each other, including <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f01b5fe\">Klaus Kinski</a>. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9efb11e5\">Les Blank</a>\u00a0was a brilliant documentarist (see his great films of musicians), and here he observes Herzog and his crew attempt to drag a massive boat over a hill, using archaic means. Tensions are strained. The madness of being a filmmaker, trying to create worlds at any cost, mud and blood and sweat. A great accompaniment to Herzog\u2019s brilliant Conquest of the Useless, his diary of the same production.</p>\n<h3>Beware of a Holy Whore (1971)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong></span><span><span class=\"content-small-print-text\">\u00a0Rainer Werner Fassbinder</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.37\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/beware-of-the-holy-whore-1971-001-balcony-party-scene.jpg?itok=E9nQUbY8\" alt=\"Beware of the Holy Whore (1971)\" title=\"Beware of the Holy Whore (1971)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.37\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/beware-of-the-holy-whore-1971-001-balcony-party-scene.jpg?itok=E9nQUbY8\" alt=\"Beware of the Holy Whore (1971)\" title=\"Beware of the Holy Whore (1971)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>One of my all time favourite <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba14dcc23\">Fassbinder</a> films, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b785edf38\">Holy Whore</a> revolves around a film production (titled Motherland or Death) happening in a hotel in Spain \u2013 partly autobiographical, based on an earlier production. Most of the attention is focused on a group of crew and actors, played by many of Fassbinder\u2019s greatest collaborators, held in a kind of purgatory, waiting around for the production to start, with drugs, alcohol, sexual intrigue and unrequited love in abundance. When the tyrannical director turns up he constantly creates tensions between the cast, flares up in anger then dissolves into melancholy, wants to quit\u2026 and there\u2019s also no film stock. When the production actually starts things don\u2019t go any better. In the end, Fassbinder seems to be saying filmmaking is a soul-crushing disaster, even if he was constantly compelled to continue.</p>\n<h3>\u2018La ricotta\u2019 (1963)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> Pier Paolo Pasolini</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.51461038961\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/rogopag-1963-001-la-ricotta-sequence-crucifixion-scene.jpg?itok=cyEax3I0\" alt=\"\u2018La ricotta\u2019 sequence from Ro.Go.Pa.G.

The film focuses on a film production of the crucifixion, with Orson Welles in the directing chair (sometimes seen reading a script of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6afab3db\">Mamma Roma</a> by Pasolini).

As ever with Pasolini, he\u2019s able to move between different registers \u2013 funny, savagely critical and also very beautiful, with the colour tableaux of the crucifixion, complete with smirking actors trying to hold their poses, inserted into the otherwise black-and-white film. Pasolini in general has been an important influence on my filmmaking, and with The Sky Trembles&#8230; most specifically with his use of locations, the mix of mythic and contemporary time, and his use of non-actors to play major parts in his films, as a way to find an authenticity within the fiction.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/ben-rivers-films-influenced-sky-trembles</link>\n   <author>Ben  Rivers</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/sky-trembles-and-the-earth-is-afraid-and-the-two-eyes-are-not-brothers-the-2016-003-tin-can-man-sunset-1000x750.jpg?itok=6i9FWewv\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Ben Rivers: the films that influenced The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/features/bfi-film-fund-slate-20152016</guid>\n   <pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\n   <title>BFI Film Fund slate 2015/2016</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn about the films awarded production funding by the BFI in the financial year 2015/2016.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"rss-content-container\"><p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49968253968\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/united-kingdom-a-2016-001-david-oyelowo-hugging-and-lifting-rosamund-pike-in-field.jpg?itok=2lb4Z5Ex\" alt=\"A United Kingdom (2016)\" title=\"A United Kingdom (2016)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49968253968\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/united-kingdom-a-2016-001-david-oyelowo-hugging-and-lifting-rosamund-pike-in-field.jpg?itok=2lb4Z5Ex\" alt=\"A United Kingdom (2016)\" title=\"A United Kingdom (2016)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">A United Kingdom (2016)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Our mission at the Film Fund is four-fold: supporting distinctive emerging filmmakers; films of cultural significance; projects that takes risks in form and content; and those that recognise the quality of difference.</p>\n<p>\tDetails on all our funding decisions can be found on our <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/film-industry/funding-awards\">Lottery awards database</a> but going forward we will list the films we are supporting at the end of each financial year and under one slate, as an example of the breadth of independent filmmaking underway across the UK.</p>\n<p>\tAs an industry we must push constantly towards a more inclusive and representative film culture, and diversity is increasingly at the heart of our decisions.</p>\n<p>\tBy sharing information on funded productions, you can see where progression is happening, and where more work needs to be done.</p>\n<p>\tAs always we count ourselves lucky to work with such an incredible range of talented writers, directors and producers, and their talented casts and crews.</p>\n<p>\tBen Roberts<br />\n\tDirector of the BFI Film Fund<br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bfiben\">@bfiben</a></p>\n<p><strong>The BFI has awarded production funding to the following films in the financial year 1 April 2015-31 March 2016</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Girl with All the Gifts</strong><br />\n\tDirector: Colm McCarthy<br />\n\tWriter: Mike Carey<br />\n\tProducer(s): Camille Gatin, Angus Lamont</p>\n<p>Scripted by graphic novelist Mike Carey, The Girl with All The Gifts is a smart and original take on the post-apocalyptic zombie film.

Lean on Pete follows 15-year-old Charley as he embarks on a perilous journey in search of his long lost aunt and a possible home. Charley\u2019s quest carries him from the horse-racing track at Portland Meadows, through the sagebrush of the Oregon desert, to the city streets of Denver, his sole companion the stolen racehorse Lean on Pete. The story of Charley is never sentimental but always compassionate, a heartbreaking and unadorned portrait of American life.

Wheatley has teamed once again with High-Rise director of photography Laurie Rose and production designer Paki Smith, who meticulously recreates the late 1970s Boston setting. Andrew Starke (Sightseers) produces with Martin Scorsese joining as executive producer \u2013 a sign of this project\u2019s ambition.

Aided by writer Moira Buffini (Jane Eyre, Tamara Drewe), Gurinder\u2019s powerful screenplay has attracted a cast that includes Hugh Bonneville and Gillian Anderson alongside emerging Indian actor Manish Dayal (The Hundred-Foot Journey).</p>\n<p><strong>A United Kingdom\u00a0</strong><br />\n\tDirector: Amma Asante<br />\n\tWriter: Guy Hibbert<br />\n\tProducer: Rick McCallum, Peter Heslop</p>\n<p>Following the success of Belle, director Amma Asante returns with a powerful romantic drama telling the remarkable true story of the 1948 marriage between the King of Bechuanaland (now Botswana) and an office clerk from London. Their relationship was opposed by everyone, from their families to the British and South African governments, but love conquers all. Written by Guy Hibbert (Eye in the Sky, Five Minutes of Heaven), the film features stand-out performances from two stellar British actors \u2013 David Oyelowo (Selma) and Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl).</p>\n<p><strong>Dark River\u00a0</strong><br />\n\tDirector: Clio Barnard<br />\n\tWriter: Clio Barnard<br />\n\tProducer: Tracy O\u2019Riordan</p>\n<p>Casting is currently under way on the new film from award-winning filmmaker Clio Barnard (The Selfish Giant). Clio was awarded the Wellcome Trust Screenwriting Fellowship in 2013 and through that opportunity was able to conduct extensive research on the visual representation of memory and trauma. That experience helped feed into her approach to this compelling contemporary rural tragedy \u2013 which we believe will further her reputation as one of the UK\u2019s most distinctive filmmaking voices.</p>\n<p><strong>Fanny Lye Deliver\u2019d</strong><br />\n\tDirector: Thomas Clay<br />\n\tWriter: Thomas Clay<br />\n\tProducer(s): Zorana Piggott, Robert Cannan, Philippe Bober</p>\n<p>Thomas Clay (Soi Cowboy, The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael) returns with a fascinating 17th-century-set English \u2018western\u2019 that digs deep into compelling questions around faith and religion of a world turned upside down.

Beast is the feature debut from writer-director Michael Pearce, who was BAFTA-nominated for his BFI-supported short film, Keeping Up with the Joneses.

Like the short, it is based on the extraordinary audio memoirs of theologian John Hull, who chronicled the process of losing his sight in the early 1980s, knowing that if he did not try and understand blindness it would destroy him. Hull&#8217;s diaries are embedded within cinematic interpretations in which actors lip-synch to the original recordings, intertwined with a lyrical narration by John and his wife, Marilyn. Crucially it is a piece that works both visually and aurally, to be appreciated by both sighted and non-sighted audiences. With partners ARTE France and Agat Ex Nihilo, they have also built an accompanying virtual reality experience in keeping with the poetic ambitions of the feature film. Notes on Blindness seeks to represent and explore blindness in much the same way that The Diving Bell and the Butterfly represented and explored locked-in syndrome and, more fundamentally, the nature of human existence.</p>\n<p><strong>The Confession</strong><br />\n\tDirector: Ashish Ghadiali<br />\n\tProducer: James Rogan</p>\n<p>From the rise of the Bosnian Mujahideen to the torture-cells of Guantanamo Bay, from the rebel training camps of Syria to the prison-bars of Belmarsh, Moazzam Begg has been a witness to a generation of conflict.

His previous work has been celebrated internationally: \u00a1Vivan las Antipodas! opened the Venice Film Festival in 2012 and Belovy was voted by filmmakers as 11th greatest documentary of all time in a Sight <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Sound poll. As an observer of the human condition, and as a gifted artist, Kossakovsky takes us on an epic journey, at the heart of which is water. Characters are introduced in stories/locations where water is the key element. This accompanies sequences at Lake Baikal which, this year, melted early due to the warmer climate, causing catastrophe, to a near-dry lake bed in Africa, to water as a form of control. The lead producer, Aimara Reques, has been based in Glasgow for over 20 years. Kossakovsky is in discussions with a number of UK composers to score the film on a symphonic scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Fly Away</strong><br />\n\tDirector: Lucy Cohen<br />\n\tProducer: Julia Nottingham</p>\n<p>Fly Away is the documentary directorial debut from Lucy Cohen, the talent behind Life in Film, a short film supporting the BFI National Film Archive\u2019s Luminous campaign. Originally developed through the BFI NET.WORK programme managed by Creative England, Fly Away will be produced by multi-award-winning production company Pulse Films (20,000 Days on Earth, The Possibilities Are Endless). It charts the emotional journey of a family who lost their father to suicide seven years ago. Five of the seven children are on the autistic spectrum and with the help of their mother they piece together fragments of the past in order to understand their place in the world and embrace the future. Combining family home video and songs with observational footage, captured in the West Midlands over the last three years, Fly Away is a coming-of-age story about how tragedy can be transformed into hope.</p>\n<p><strong>Even When I Fall\u00a0</strong><br />\n\tDirector(s): Kate McLarnon, Sky Neal<br />\n\tProducer: Elhum Shakerifar</p>\n<p>Even When I Fall is the debut documentary from directors Sky Neal and Kate McLarnon working with Elhum Shakerifar, who produced Sean McAllister\u2019s highly acclaimed and timely documentary A Syrian Love Story, released last year. Over the past five years the filmmakers have been working with Nepal&#8217;s first circus, Circus Kathmandu, set up by survivors of child trafficking, and they tell the story of three remarkable young women who find their voices on the world stage as advocates against modern day slavery.</p>\n<p><strong>Untitled project</strong><br />\n\tDirector: Tim Travers Hawkins</p>\n<p><strong>The Hard Stop</strong><br />\n\tDirector: George Amponsah<br />\n\tProducer: Dionne Walker</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hard-stop-the-2015-002-men-in-hoodies-looking-at-camera.jpg?itok=gygujq3G\" alt=\"The Hard Stop (2015)\" title=\"The Hard Stop (2015)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hard-stop-the-2015-002-men-in-hoodies-looking-at-camera.jpg?itok=gygujq3G\" alt=\"The Hard Stop (2015)\" title=\"The Hard Stop (2015)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>George Amponsah\u2019s hybrid observational documentary The Hard Stop follows several years in the lives of two of the closest friends of Mark Duggan, whose death while being arrested by armed police in Tottenham, London sparked the UK riots of 2011. The Hard Stop employs the imaginative use of archive and iconic cinematography to tell Marcus and Kurtis\u2019s story growing up with Duggan on the Broadwater Farm housing estate. Amponsah has made the award-winning feature length documentaries The Importance of Being Elegant (co-directed by Cosima Spender and nominated for a Grierson Award) and The Fighting Spirit (Sheffield Doc/Fest) and is working with Dionne Walker, an emerging writer-producer being mentored by editor Joe Bini (Grizzly Man, Cave of Forgotten Dreams, We Need to Talk about Kevin).\u00a0 The Hard Stop was successful at the BFI and Sheffield Doc/Fest pitching session in 2014, where the panel thought this compelling and timely project about a pivotal time in recent British history had clear cinematic potential. The filmmakers continued to work with the Sundance Lab and have emerged with a striking and important film that has been invited to screen at TIFF in the City to City programme. The BFI\u2019s funding helped them finish the film to screen at the festival in September 2015.</p>\n<h3>Completion</h3>\n<p><strong>The Man from Mo\u2019Wax</strong><br />\n\tDirector: Matthew Jones<br />\n\tProducer: M.J.

Yet films which stubbornly pursue goals that remain just out of reach have a peculiar fascination. It may well be that most cult movies are imperfect, their gaps, flaws and errors creating spaces into which viewers can insert themselves \u2013 meeting the filmmakers half-way, as it were \u2013 thus becoming active collaborators rather than passive consumers. This process is literalised by <a href=\"http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6b483615\">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a> (1975), in which gaps in the soundtrack are filled by members of the audience.</p>\n<p>There is, so far as I\u2019m aware, no substantial cult following for <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b71ca5537\">The Pedestrian</a> (Der Fu\u00dfg\u00e4nger, 1973), one of nine films directed by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1b29e60\">Maximilian Schell</a>. Despite having received an Academy Award nomination (for best foreign-language film) and several glowing reviews, The Pedestrian was never released in the UK (though an English-dubbed version was screened by ITV in 1985), and is only available on DVD in Germany. Yet The Pedestrian is a remarkably illuminating work, revealing a great deal about not only West Germany in the 1970s, but also about the more obviously successful German films of this period.</p>\n<p>The plot focuses on Heinz Alfred Giese (theatre director <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba060572f\">Gustav Rudolf Sellner</a>), a German industrialist whose Nazi past is exposed by the press, but whose responsibility for a massacre in Greece remains ambiguous to the end. In its attempt to deal with the relationship between modern Germany and the Nazi era, The Pedestrian sets out to tackle Germany\u2019s central dilemma in the 1970s, and if it ultimately proves incapable of reaching a conclusion, this suggests the sheer enormity of the trauma experienced by Schell\u2019s generation, a trauma incompatible with neat narrative or artistic solutions.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.50943396226\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/pedestrian-the-1973-002-scene-of-crowds-climbing-wall.jpg?itok=mtu3mYHH\" alt=\"The Pedestrian (Der Fu\u00dfg\u00e4nger, 1973)\" title=\"The Pedestrian (Der Fu\u00dfg\u00e4nger, 1973)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.50943396226\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/pedestrian-the-1973-002-scene-of-crowds-climbing-wall.jpg?itok=mtu3mYHH\" alt=\"The Pedestrian (Der Fu\u00dfg\u00e4nger, 1973)\" title=\"The Pedestrian (Der Fu\u00dfg\u00e4nger, 1973)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">The Pedestrian (Der Fu\u00dfg\u00e4nger, 1973)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>When it appeared in 1973, The Pedestrian could have been viewed alongside many better-known examples of the New German Cinema; the previous year had seen the release of Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s <a href=\"http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6f5b2e41\">The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant</a>, Wim Wenders\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a79c8ab\">The Goalkeeper\u2019s Fear of the Penalty</a> and Werner Herzog\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a54c395\">Aguirre, Wrath of God</a>. Yet Schell seems to be operating in complete ignorance of this movement, attempting to find his own answers to the questions that obsessed his contemporaries.</p>\n<p>The end result, however, is hardly unmediated by cinema, owing a clear debt to the work of several prominent auteurs. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f22ac44\">Costa-Gavras</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f0833c7\">Francesco Rosi</a> are perhaps the dominant influences, but there are also traces of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba11c3454\">Michelangelo Antonioni</a> (particularly in Giese\u2019s meeting with his young mistress), <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f0a4b31\">Alain Resnais</a> (the use of flashbacks), <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ee60a60\">Ingmar Bergman</a> (two monologues about death) and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f2002cc\">Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3</a> (a communal dance). The film even plays itself out via a lengthy television debate, as if this televisual form might be just as adequate as any of the more obviously cinematic models for resolving Schell\u2019s dilemma.</p>\n<p>What is signally lacking from this list, however, are the names of any US filmmakers, an absence all the more surprising given that Schell was primarily known for his collaborations with such directors as Edward Dmytryk (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bb6b271\">The Young Lions</a>, 1958) and Stanley Kramer (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6adb5558\">Judgment at Nuremberg</a>, 1961). This was surely a conscious choice on the part of Schell, who may well have associated Hollywood with precisely the kind of sentimental approach he was determined to avoid, but it ironically proved to be precisely what separated him from those directors who would soon define German cinema for the world at large.</p>\n<p>Fassbinder, Herzog and Wenders \u2013 whose oeuvres are replete with references to American cinema and music \u2013 were in possession of the secret which eluded Schell; that Germany\u2019s postwar history could only be understood through the prism of American culture. According to Wenders [in Jan Dawson\u2019s 1976 interview collection named after the director], \u201cThe most dominant effect (of growing up in postwar Germany) was the tendency to stick to other histories or to become involved in other cultures. In the early 50s or even the 60s, it was American culture\u2026 the need to forget 20 years created a hole, and people tried to cover this\u2026 in both senses\u2026 by assimilating American culture\u2026 the fact that US imperialism was so effective over here was highly favoured by the Germans\u2019 own difficulties with their past\u2026 because of that guilt feeling and the need to cover that hole.

A critique of imperialism underlies both scenes, but whereas Blood of the Condor figures in Schell\u2019s film as an idealised object of desire \u2013 the product of a culture in which resistance to imperialism can be seen as a pure act, untainted by any suspicion that the oppressors may be morally purer than the oppressed \u2013 You\u2019re Never Too Young functions for Fassbinder as both an artefact of American cultural imperialism and a reminder of this particular imperialism\u2019s defining role in postwar Germany; the manner in which Saitz bullies his subordinates into recreating You\u2019re Never Too Young\u2019s onscreen action suggests fascism is being resuscitated not by returning to the assumptions of the Nazi era, but rather by assimilating the products of a democratic ideology that is supposedly fascism\u2019s polar opposite.</p>\n<p>The Pedestrian seems to be simultaneously aware and unaware of how 1970s Germany has been shaped by US influence; a scene in which ageing actor <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2baaac70e0\">Norbert Schiller</a> (playing himself) compares the classical roles he was once known for in Germany with the small parts has more recently been taking in commercial American films hints at this without ever bringing it into focus. In his need to interrogate Germany\u2019s past, and his inability to find a language in which to do so, Maximilian Schell might well be the most purely German director of this period.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/bradlands/pedestrian-post-war-germany-without-chewing-gum</link>\n   <author>Brad  Stevens</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/pedestrian-the-1973-001-mans-head-in-broken-windscreen_600x450.jpg?itok=fhVBgwcY\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[The Pedestrian: post-war Germany without the chewing gum]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/video/barbaric-poetry-can-we-really-film-holocaust</guid>\n   <pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\n   <title>Video: Barbaric poetry \u2013 can we really film the Holocaust?</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As\u00a0L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes\u2019s award-winning Son of Saul forges a new way of dramatising an Auschwitz-like death camp, Leigh Singer revisits the ethical arguments around the art of the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"rss-content-container\"><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/taxonomy/term/868\"><img src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/16x9_small/public/sight-and-sound-logo-280x69.png?itok=rIH2faKE\" alt=\"\" /></a><p><div class=\"video  \">\n      <div class=\"bfi-ma-vid-container\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 400px\">\n      <iframe class=\"kaltura-player\" frameborder=\"0\" data-src=\"//www.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v1.6.6/mwEmbedFrame.php/wid/_857922/uiconf_id/7960791/entry_id/1_ifnomjnx\" title=\"Kaltura video player\" type=\"text/html\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n    \n    </div>\n</p>\n<p>The emotionally and intellectually fraught \u2013 and very public \u2013 debate about what can or cannot be depicted when recounting, or worse, reconstructing the Holocaust on film goes back at least as far as Gillo Pontecorvo\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6addabeb\">Kap\u00f2</a>\u00a0(1960).

Her work celebrates and studies multi-faceted, interesting and, often, deeply flawed women, challenging our notion of femininity in the process. Both as writer and director, Campion doesn\u2019t shy away from the brutality of the female experience but, even though her protagonists are often under extreme duress, they are never victims, instead taking their fates firmly into their own hands.</p>\n<p>For audiences used to viewing the intricacies of life through a predominantly masculine lens, Campion\u2019s work may initially seem alien and impenetrable, often requiring a shift of perspective. Once tuned in, however, there is the revelation that they are all superb stories, showcasing compelling narratives that are a breath of fresh air whatever your gender.</p>\n<h3>The best place to start \u2013 Top of the Lake</h3>\n<p>While the most obvious place to start exploring Campion\u2019s work may seem to be her acclaimed, award-winning 1993 drama The Piano \u2013 which propelled her into the history books as the first (and, at the time of writing, only) woman to win the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or \u2013 her recent small-screen drama offers easier access.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.78397212544\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/top-of-the-lake-2013-001-elizabeth-moss-lake.jpg?itok=QPy5qvNk\" alt=\"Top of the Lake (2013)\" title=\"Top of the Lake (2013)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.78397212544\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/top-of-the-lake-2013-001-elizabeth-moss-lake.jpg?itok=QPy5qvNk\" alt=\"Top of the Lake (2013)\" title=\"Top of the Lake (2013)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Top of the Lake (2013)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Sharing directorial duties with series co-creator <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc72d7c2b\">Garth Davis</a>, and returning to her New Zealand home two decades after The Piano, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/51cb7996643e3\"><strong>Top of the Lake</strong></a>\u00a0(2013) fuses Campion\u2019s feminist sensibilities with majestic locations and an absorbing Scandinavian-noir atmosphere. Mad Men\u2019s Elisabeth Moss takes the central role of Detective Robin Griffin whose investigations into the statutory rape and disappearance of a pregnant 12-year-old stir up both horrifying small-town secrets and her own painful past.</p>\n<p>Despite the overarching motif of lives as wild and untamed as the landscape they inhabit, underscored by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bdeebcf4f\">Adam Arkapaw</a>\u2019s magnificent, brooding cinematography and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2be0fdb136\">Mark Bradshaw</a>\u2019s melancholic score, this is, ultimately, Robin\u2019s story. Resolutely avoiding all the normal clich\u00e9s surrounding broken women and sexual violence, Top of the Lake allows its female protagonist to be both wounded and strong in all senses \u2013 emotionally, sexually and, as one memorable scene involving a broken bottle attests, physically. As the horrors swirl around her, she holds her own both professionally and personally, affected by the case but never overwhelmed or undermined by it.</p>\n<h3>What to watch next</h3>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.51996105161\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/campion-jane-001-looking-over-shoulder-against-red-background-in-the-cut-00n-5sw-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=ZccOxPeq\" alt=\"Jane Campion\" title=\"Jane Campion\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.51996105161\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/campion-jane-001-looking-over-shoulder-against-red-background-in-the-cut-00n-5sw-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=ZccOxPeq\" alt=\"Jane Campion\" title=\"Jane Campion\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Jane Campion</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve been introduced to Campion\u2019s bold ethos, it\u2019s time to take on the cinematic big guns. Rightly lauded, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7b54d000\"><strong>The Piano</strong></a> may still remain a challenging watch, both for its difficult themes and paucity of dialogue. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1692667\">Holly Hunter</a> plays Ava, a mute woman sent to 1850s New Zealand for an arranged marriage, accompanied by her young daughter. Upon their arrival, forester Baines (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9fb1b395\">Harvey Keitel</a>) buys her piano and barters it back to her, key by key, for increasingly intimate favours.</p>\n<p>In lesser hands this may have been the uncomfortable exploitation of a vulnerable woman, but Campion\u2019s masterful screenplay and sensitive direction, matched by stunning performances \u2013 not least Hunter, who expresses Ava\u2019s innate strength of character without saying a word \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1980fc5\">Michael Nyman</a>\u2019s evocative piano score turns this into a haunting and tender love story. The film went on to achieve US box office of more than $40m and garnered multiple awards (out of eight Oscar nominations, it won three awards: best actress, best supporting actress and best screenplay).</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/angel-at-my-table-an-1990-001-girl-bicycle-field.jpg?itok=m7RpwEiT\" alt=\"An Angel at My Table (1990)\" title=\"An Angel at My Table (1990)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/angel-at-my-table-an-1990-001-girl-bicycle-field.jpg?itok=m7RpwEiT\" alt=\"An Angel at My Table (1990)\" title=\"An Angel at My Table (1990)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">An Angel at My Table (1990)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>With The Piano under your belt, the time is right to explore the rest of Campion\u2019s mesmeric back catalogue. Start with the blistering, multiple award-winning <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7a726697\"><strong>An Angel at My Table</strong></a> (1990), adapted by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba0d2bbd6\">Laura Jones</a> from New Zealand novelist <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc1822a24\">Janet Frame</a>\u2019s autobiographical books To the Is-Land, An Angel at My Table and The Envoy from Mirror City. Exploring Frame\u2019s troubled life from her poverty-stricken youth to her time in a mental institute and subsequent writing career, Campion directs the three actors who portray her at various ages (Karen Fergusson, Alexia Keogh and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba9643681\">Kerry Fox</a>) to present a cohesive portrait of a woman who not only triumphed over adversity but also went on to become an inspiration in her own right.</p>\n<p>With 2003\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8846fe87\"><strong>In the Cut</strong></a>, Campion presents a tale in which a woman\u2019s sexual awakening was entirely for her own benefit, rather than for the titillation of a male character (or, indeed, audience). America\u2019s sweetheart <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1ad8c6f\">Meg Ryan</a> plays New York writing professor Frannie Avery who starts a relationship with police detective Malloy (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2baee2af90\">Mark Ruffalo</a>) \u2013 a man she doesn\u2019t like but is overwhelmingly attracted to \u2013 and more than meets the sexual challenges he presents, indulging her carnality in increasing intensity and explicitness. It\u2019s rare for any film to separate out female desire from romance, but Campion insists that women can be just as sexually confident as men and, crucially, does it from the vantage point of empowerment, rather than subjection.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/bright-star-2009-002-ben-whishaw-walk-woods-00o-1qa.jpg?itok=kA3KO6CC\" alt=\"Bright Star (2009)\" title=\"Bright Star (2009)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/bright-star-2009-002-ben-whishaw-walk-woods-00o-1qa.jpg?itok=kA3KO6CC\" alt=\"Bright Star (2009)\" title=\"Bright Star (2009)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Bright Star (2009)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>While 2009\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8c9efbf1\"><strong>Bright Star</strong></a> may be a rather more genteel affair, it\u2019s no less powerful in its depiction of female sensuality and sexuality. While it has at its heart the 19th-century poet John Keats (a devastating performance from <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc1b5980d\">Ben Whishaw</a>), its focus is his relationship with Fanny Brawne (the excellent <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc81aa1b8\">Abbie Cornish</a>). Indeed, she is the protagonist of this story, not only his inspiration but his equal. Campion\u2019s screenplay captures not only the intensity of their passion but their mutual respect and admiration, underscoring the importance and impetus she brought to his work and his life. This is no breathy period piece, rather a celebration of mutual love.</p>\n<h3>Where not to start</h3>\n<p>While both <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7d04a829\"><strong>The Portrait of a Lady</strong></a> (1996) and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b816a4c23\"><strong>Holy Smoke</strong></a> (1999) fit with Campion\u2019s commitment to front-and-centre female characters, neither have the dramatic or political punch of her other works. The Portrait of a Lady, adapted by Laura Jones from <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba16b93e0\">Henry James</a>\u2019 novel, boasts a starry cast including <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba7ebf669\">Nicole Kidman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba187e4ef\">John Malkovich</a>, along with two Oscar nominations, but is something of a damp squib. Constrained by James\u2019 narrative, which sees independent-spirited Isabel (Kidman) fall into a hateful marriage with the odious artist Gilbert (Malkovich), it\u2019s a join-the-dots period drama rather than an example of Campion at her best.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.46412884334\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/portrait-of-a-lady-the-1996-nicole-kidman-john-malkovich-wallpaper-00m-xl1.jpg?itok=0QFg2wC9\" alt=\"The Portrait of a Lady (1996)\" title=\"The Portrait of a Lady (1996)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.46412884334\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/portrait-of-a-lady-the-1996-nicole-kidman-john-malkovich-wallpaper-00m-xl1.jpg?itok=0QFg2wC9\" alt=\"The Portrait of a Lady (1996)\" title=\"The Portrait of a Lady (1996)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">The Portrait of a Lady (1996)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, Holy Smoke features two intriguing performances, from <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bab399a5b\">Kate Winslet</a> as Ruth, a young Australian who has fallen under the spell of an Indian cult, and Harvey Keitel as PJ, the man employed to bring her home. While their dynamic is interesting and its feminist credentials intact \u2013 Ruth besting PJ at every turn \u2013 its uneven tone and occasional heavy-handedness undermine its message somewhat. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s worth a look in the context of Campion\u2019s overall body of work, an early example of her uncompromising, enduring worldview.</p>\n<h3>More Fast-tracks to

Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The nice folks of Bedford Falls are singing Auld Lang Syne, the credits are rolling, and, once again, the tears are streaming down my cheeks. On the other sofa, 15-year-old Clo is watching me with her head slightly to one side like a curious bird. \u201cYou&#8217;re crying,\u201d she says, accusingly. I know she&#8217;s wondering, as Potter, the wicked capitalist in <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b72fd693f\">It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life</a>, did of George Bailey, are you one of those starry-eyed dreamers, a believer in all that sentimental hogwash?\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What me? Starry-eyed? Sentimental? Dreamer? No \u2013 three times over, resoundingly \u2013 not me! I&#8217;m one of those unblinking realists. Face me with reality, and I look long and hard at it, and the more I don&#8217;t like it (and mostly I don&#8217;t), the less I&#8217;ll blink.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But I don&#8217;t know how to explain, either to myself, or to my daughter, why it is I weep every time Clarence, angel second-class, shows George that his life has made a difference to the nice people of Bedford Falls. Or why the same thing happens to me watching <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ae66fdd\">Lady for a Day</a>, when Apple Annie, panhandler and drunk, is transformed into a society hostess to sustain her daughter&#8217;s misconceptions, by Dave duh Dooke. Or again, when the hero of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b02caea\">Meet John Doe</a> reads the radio speech that&#8217;s been written for him about the importance of the \u2018little people\u2019, and starts to believe it.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Curious about those tears, I&#8217;d been trying to watch It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life again, but Clo always vetoed it, because it wasn&#8217;t Christmas. Luckily, the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ee4cfc7\">Capra</a> Collection has just been released on video, and, since it counts as work, I was allowed another viewing, out of season.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.808333333333\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/Lady-for-a-day-001-00n-fg6.jpg?itok=2zALvJ6M\" alt=\"Apple Annie (May Robson) dreaming of her daughter (Jean Parker) in Lady for a Day\" title=\"Apple Annie (May Robson) dreaming of her daughter (Jean Parker) in Lady for a Day\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"0.808333333333\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/Lady-for-a-day-001-00n-fg6.jpg?itok=2zALvJ6M\" alt=\"Apple Annie (May Robson) dreaming of her daughter (Jean Parker) in Lady for a Day\" title=\"Apple Annie (May Robson) dreaming of her daughter (Jean Parker) in Lady for a Day\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Apple Annie (May Robson) dreaming of her daughter (Jean Parker) in Lady for a Day</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Videos are a blessing to the secretly sentimental like myself, who want to keep the weeping private. At home, unlike in the cinema where the lights come up just after the crying hits so that you have to face the world puffy-eyed and mucousy, you can let the tears roll freely and blow your nose into an entire boxful of paper hankies. Only the sharp eyes of a semi-cynical adolescent have to be faced, and that, I suppose, is the price you pay for populating the world.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Time is also an able assistant in the crying department. I wonder, if they could wipe time from old movies (in the guise of the quality of the print, in the softened lighting tones, in the almost physically distant, crackling soundtrack), like they do when re-mastering old recordings on to CDs, if their power wouldn&#8217;t lessen. Billie Holiday, without the cratered sound of the decades, is stunning, but I always have a sense that something&#8217;s been lost in the cleaning. The distance between me and a movie is part of the experience of watching, and, paradoxically, perhaps the silvery blur has the same effect as the grey hair and wrinkles of an aged head and face, allowing us to trust the story to the storyteller.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Which is why, I suppose, remakes so rarely work. Isn&#8217;t the power of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b82020179\">Casablanca</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b71208b72\">Les Enfants du Paradis</a>, something to do with feeling, in the print itself, the times in which they were made? The sharp tones and perfect focus of modern popular movies \u2013 Lethal Weapon 3 for instance, or Batman Returns \u2013 speak directly to us about quantities of dollars, and techno-wizardry. They are certainly of their time, but trust them? How could we; they are not speaking to us. They don&#8217;t call. The voice gets lost in their shiny brightness.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In a tribute at the beginning of one of the videos, Frank Capra Jnr explains that his father&#8217;s art was all about his \u201clove of ordinary, common people\u201d. Now it&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s the John Does and George Baileys of this world \u2013\u00a0hoboes, small-town idealists, panhandlers and hustlers \u2013 who are the heroes of Capra&#8217;s movies, but the heartbeat of each movie is the despair that each of them feels about society and their lives. Apple Annie, John Doe and George Bailey all contemplate suicide but are saved at the last moment, not by a faith in life, but by fairy tales and miraculous interventions. Capra may have loved people, but people aren&#8217;t the subject of his films; America is.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Capra&#8217;s America is not that geographical landmass just above Mexico, but a mythological place in the geography of the mind, whose boundary fences are flyposted with copies of the American Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg address. Inside its borders, great battles are fought between the forces of good and evil, for magical though it may be, it is a land where economic depression and spiritual destitution are rife. The bad guys are capitalists, self-seeking bureaucrats and totalitarians (Henry Potter, the Police Commissioner, D. B. Norton), but they are invariably beaten by democracy, which is to say, the decent, right-thinking will of the people, even if it does need a shove or two from someone quoting the seminal literature to remind them that they hold the safety of the world in their hands.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.27750177431\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/Its-a-wonderful-life-002-00m-d5e.jpg?itok=oT7NfpGg\" alt=\"Capra&amp;#039;s true subject in It&amp;#039;s a Wonderful Life (above) and his other films, was America, a land where the bad guys are invariably beaten by democracy\" title=\"Capra&amp;#039;s true subject in It&amp;#039;s a Wonderful Life (above) and his other films, was America, a land where the bad guys are invariably beaten by democracy\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.27750177431\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/Its-a-wonderful-life-002-00m-d5e.jpg?itok=oT7NfpGg\" alt=\"Capra&amp;#039;s true subject in It&amp;#039;s a Wonderful Life (above) and his other films, was America, a land where the bad guys are invariably beaten by democracy\" title=\"Capra&amp;#039;s true subject in It&amp;#039;s a Wonderful Life (above) and his other films, was America, a land where the bad guys are invariably beaten by democracy\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Capra's true subject in It's a Wonderful Life (above) and his other films, was America, a land where the bad guys are invariably beaten by democracy</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Capra&#8217;s America (the diametrical opposite of Kafka&#8217;s Amerika) is the place where tough as-old-boots realists like myself can howl. It&#8217;s a small compartment of the mind that retains unassailable notions of honesty, decency, goodness, fairness, and how things ought to be. They&#8217;ve been there forever, since they are fine ideas and proper ideals for social animals to possess, but they live, concealed for safety, behind a thicket of realpolitik; the world as she has to be lived; people as they have to be experienced.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the aid of shadows on the silver screen, Capra describes the outline of his America and superimposes it on our own. The fit is simple and perfect: Potter has a bust of Napoleon in his office, George has a painting of Abe Lincoln in his; John Doe&#8217;s raincoat is always wet and open, D.B. Norton&#8217;s has a fur collar and is buttoned up.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But Capra is not an escapist. I&#8217;ve never understood how It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life is seen as a beacon of Christmas hope. It&#8217;s one of the darkest films I know. George Bailey&#8217;s lifelong struggle is to come to terms with disappointment, with a hatful of dreams that never come true. He never gets away from small-town America (a fantasy within a fantasy), he never builds his bridges and towers. He&#8217;s trapped into his destiny by the needs of others: he doesn&#8217;t want to run Building and Loan when his father dies, he doesn&#8217;t want to love Mary and be tied down forever. But he does both, watching his dreams shrivel as the decades pass and ordinary, pleasant enough life goes on, until, as if his good nature and sense of duty counted for zero, everything comes crashing to the ground, thanks to nothing more than mere accident. Having sacrificed everything he has longed for, he is about to become destitute and probably imprisoned as well. He comes to the conclusion, not unreasonably, that it would have been better if he&#8217;d never been born. \u201cThat&#8217;s what you get for praying for help,\u201d he says, black and bitter. A nice family film, huh?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Under the circumstances, I tell myself and Clo, I&#8217;m perfectly entitled to weep, because things are not how they should be, and worse than that, they won&#8217;t ever be. It doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m not a realist, it means I am, but I&#8217;m sorry for how things are. Isn&#8217;t that a thing to cry about?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf you want a simple place where people are nice, and help each other, why don&#8217;t you go and live in Dunmanway?\u201d, Clo suggests, ever practical (think rural Ireland, donkeys, no electricity and happy holidays). \u201cI don&#8217;t want to live in Dunmanway\u201d, I wail, hiccuping back the tears. \u201cI want to live in the centre of London, where the air is poisoned, and bombs go off, and people sleep in doorways, and where fossil fuels are being exhausted just so that I can watch Frank Capra movies on the VCR, and remind myself of the way things aren&#8217;t.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And the funny thing is, Clo nods her understanding at me and gives a little smile. I suppose she must have America in her head, too.\u00a0</span></p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/jenny-diski-curious-tears-its-wonderful-life-crying-movies</link>\n   <author>Jenny  Diski</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/Its-a-wonderful-life-001-00m-d5c-1000x750.jpg?itok=ZB03oFh0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[From our archives: Curious tears \u2013 Jenny Diski on crying for Capra\u2019s America]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/features/20-inspired-visual-moments-citizen-kane</guid>\n   <pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\n   <title>20 inspired visual moments in Citizen Kane</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s this kind of dazzling invention that has made Orson Welles&amp;#8217;s masterful debut so influential for 75 years and counting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"rss-content-container\"><p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33345683587\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/citizen-kane-1941-002-orson-welles-political-podium-00m-dn6_1.jpg?itok=kg7WmLR1\" alt=\"Citizen Kane (1941)\" title=\"Citizen Kane (1941)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33345683587\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/citizen-kane-1941-002-orson-welles-political-podium-00m-dn6_1.jpg?itok=kg7WmLR1\" alt=\"Citizen Kane (1941)\" title=\"Citizen Kane (1941)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Citizen Kane (1941)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>If you hold with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1cd8b44\">Orson Welles</a>\u2019s gleeful endorsement that making a film is \u201cthe biggest electric train set any boy ever had\u201d, then his feature debut <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a7a801b\">Citizen Kane</a>\u00a0is the hi-tech, speeding locomotive that powered cinema into the future.

Once dominated by the sex industry and a hub for London\u2019s underworld figures, Soho has provided filmmakers with a geographical and mental landscape rich in atmosphere and reputation, perfectly suited for tales of teen angst, violent crime, sexual exploitation and, occasionally, creative freedom and unadulterated pleasure. A Rabelaisian playground in the heart of the city, the Soho committed to celluloid has alternately been reflective, exaggerated, celebratory and condemnatory. One such film to have used Soho\u2019s sights, sounds and reputation in foreboding, sensationalist terms is Edmond T. Gr\u00e9ville\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b69550c97\">Beat Girl</a> (1959).</p>\n<p>A coming-of-age tale of adolescent rebellion and its consequences that plays out in Soho\u2019s coffee shops, strip joints and jazz clubs, Beat Girl pitted beatniks against \u2018squares\u2019 in a prime example of a British \u2018juvenile delinquent\u2019 B-movie. Often cheesy (especially the imported American slang on display) but never less than entertaining, Beat Girl\u2019s cast included pouty 15-year-old starlet <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ef39327\">Gillian Hills</a> as the titular, wayward teen Jennifer, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ef2bf3c\">David Farrar</a> as her father, a young <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba14d0d0d\">Adam Faith</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9efa7db0\">Oliver Reed</a> as two hip-swinging cool cats and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f466c12\">Christopher Lee</a> as Kenny King, a sleazy, Machiavellian strip-club manager. As well as its eye-catching cast, Beat Girl is notable for containing the first commissioned work for film of the late, great <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9fd59327\">John Barry</a>. Barry\u2019s theme tune is an absolute corker too, an edgy, upbeat guitar- and sax-driven number that sets the tone for the racy tale that follows. Its thrills are sure to send you over and out, daddio!</p>\n<p>To celebrate our release of Beat Girl on Blu-ray and DVD, as part of the Flipside series, here are 10 more features that have captured some of the spirit of Soho on film.</p>\n<h3>Piccadilly (1929)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0<span>E.A.

Dupont&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7579dc11\">Piccadilly</a> is an innovative and stylish tale directed and performed with confidence and passion. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ee3e411\">Dupont</a> had written and directed Moulin Rouge for British International Pictures the previous year, but now turned to a script by novelist and screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba124e267\">Arnold Bennett</a> about desire and murder set in the eponymous Soho nightclub, which the film brings to life in opulent, expressionistic fashion.</p>\n<p>Cosmopolitan, modernist and designed to appeal to an international audience, Piccadilly was dominated by the performance of Chinese-American actor <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1d1fa46\">Anna May Wong</a>. As Shosho, a scullery maid turned dancing star, Wong is compelling as she flits between icy ambition, seductiveness and youthful vulnerability. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba15baf9f\">Gilda Gray</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1c2c6dd\">Jameson Thomas</a> provide solid support as former star turn Mabel and impresario Valentine Wilmot respectively, the latter&#8217;s growing and reciprocated fondness for Shosho causing jealousy and despair in Mabel and Shosho&#8217;s erstwhile beau, Jim (King Hou Chang). In Piccadilly, Soho is a hothouse of emotions, the strength of which destroys lives.</p>\n<h3>Murder at the Windmill (1949)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Val Guest</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.28109273904\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/murder-at-the-windmill-1949-001-stage-00n-s2j.jpg?itok=bBvRkeAe\" alt=\"Murder at the Windmill (1949)\" title=\"Murder at the Windmill (1949)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.28109273904\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/murder-at-the-windmill-1949-001-stage-00n-s2j.jpg?itok=bBvRkeAe\" alt=\"Murder at the Windmill (1949)\" title=\"Murder at the Windmill (1949)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Though calling <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b0e9228\">Murder at the Windmill</a> a great film would be pushing things, it is nonetheless of much worth, capturing as it does the comedy sketches, skits and songs of the \u2018Revudeville\u2019 shows that helped to make the Windmill Theatre&#8217;s name. Mystery at the Burlesque, as it was known in the US, was the first film to include footage from inside the theatre as it was shot partly in situ at the famous venue.</p>\n<p>A not entirely successful crime drama-cum-musical, Guest&#8217;s self-penned tale starred <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f408c59\">Garry Marsh</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f0a5d09\">Jon Pertwee</a> as Metropolitan police officers investigating the murder by shooting of an audience member during a performance. Instructing the Windmill&#8217;s acts (played by the theatre&#8217;s actual stars) to repeat the full routine in order to help them solve the case, the police officers, and by design the viewer, are treated to a variety performance that far outshines the thinly plotted whodunit it\u2019s wrapped up in.</p>\n<h3>Night and the City (1950)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Jules Dassin</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.30115690528\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/night-and-the-city-1950-001-richard-widmark-london-bus-00m-wbo.jpg?itok=1isZF3Kl\" alt=\"Night and the City (1950)\" title=\"Night and the City (1950)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.30115690528\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/night-and-the-city-1950-001-richard-widmark-london-bus-00m-wbo.jpg?itok=1isZF3Kl\" alt=\"Night and the City (1950)\" title=\"Night and the City (1950)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Though <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba140ee1f\">Jules Dassin</a>\u2019s adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bab74e488\">Gerald Kersh</a>\u2019s 1938 novel of the same name strays beyond the confines of Soho on numerous occasions, it is very much a Soho movie.

This gentle comedy-cum-mystery was also the first film to portray Soho&#8217;s Chinatown in any great depth. Utilising numerous shops, restaurants and clubs in Chinatown, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b75837499\">Ping Pong</a> depicts a British-Chinese family facing an uncertain future after the death of paterfamilias and local restaurateur Sam Wong (K.C.

A clash of Anglicised lives, traditional cultural values and personal ambitions makes Choi a go-between as her seemingly easy task is made complex, with Wong&#8217;s restaurant in the heart of Chinatown the family&#8217;s symbolic battleground.</p>\n<h3>Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon (1998)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0<span>John Maybury</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49915824916\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/love-is-the-devil-1998-002-derek-jacobi-with-newspaper-00m-il0.jpg?itok=-vAxtv-R\" alt=\"Love is the Devil (1998)\" title=\"Love is the Devil (1998)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49915824916\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/love-is-the-devil-1998-002-derek-jacobi-with-newspaper-00m-il0.jpg?itok=-vAxtv-R\" alt=\"Love is the Devil (1998)\" title=\"Love is the Devil (1998)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The winner of three awards at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba2adcefd\">John Maybury</a>\u2019s biopic of famed, figurative painter Francis Bacon (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f0ec7de\">Derek Jacobi</a>) is a raw and booze-soaked representation of the artist\u2019s fractious seven-year relationship with petty thief George Dyer (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bac45a323\">Daniel Craig</a>).

The private members club for artists and creatives was painstakingly recreated at 3 Mills Studios to match how it looked during the sixties.</p>\n<p>Maybury is unflinching in his portrayal of the mammoth drinking sessions and often scabrous, ugly slanging matches indulged in by Bacon and his coterie in The Colony Room, which included famously foul-mouthed proprietress Muriel Belcher (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1bf036b\">Tilda Swinton</a>) and chronic alcoholic photographer John Deakin (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba0be89c6\">Karl Johnson</a>).

And indeed, while this broadest of genres can certainly accommodate all manner of spectacular actions and space operas, it is often at its best when privileging big ideas. So without further ado, here follows a preview of some of the more cerebrally inclined entries in this year\u2019s Sci-Fi-London festival: films that present a cinematic stage for thought experiments and philosophical enquiry.</p>\n<h4>The Open</h4>\n<div class=\"content-information\">\n<p><a href=\"http://sci-fi-london.com/festival/2016/programme\">Sci-Fi-London 2016</a>\u00a0runs 27 April\u20136 May at venues around east London.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Take Marc Lahore\u2019s The Open (pictured above). Though set amidst a long-running global war, the film keeps combat at its periphery while placing at its centre a strange oasis of improbable pacifism. While battle planes roar over a bleak, wintry shoreline, a grief-driven coach and two traumatised tennis pros ignore the surrounding mayhem. Instead they mime out a constructed, rule-bound scenario of peace-time normality: a mixed-sex tennis tournament without racket strings, balls or even an audience, reminiscent of the final scene from Michelangelo Antonioni&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6f695fc4\">Blowup</a> (1966).\u00a0As the two shell-shocked players gradually fall in love, and the stakes, for all their wilful emptiness, intensify, the film presents an alternative, entirely fictive form of conflict resolution in the face of mutually assured mass destruction.</p>\n<h4>Polder</h4>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"2.39925373134\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/polder-2015-001-woman-walking-up-green-path-amidst-pastel-buildings.jpg?itok=ke-uaKk8\" alt=\"Polder (2015)\" title=\"Polder (2015)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"2.39925373134\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/polder-2015-001-woman-walking-up-green-path-amidst-pastel-buildings.jpg?itok=ke-uaKk8\" alt=\"Polder (2015)\" title=\"Polder (2015)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Likewise concerned with game-playing, albeit far less visually austere, Samuel Schwarz and Julian M. Gr\u00fcnthal\u2019s hyper-stylised Polder riffs lysergically on the <a href=\"http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b80d1da3b\">eXistenZ</a>-ial conundrums raised by a new immersive video game whose chimerical characters and settings are hard to distinguish from non-virtual reality, even as they simultaneously mirror and mask the horrors of their developers\u2019 exploitative commercial activities. As Ryuko (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd0c7b1ab\">Nina Fog</a>) searches these disorienting digital landscapes for her lost husband \u2013 and the game\u2019s creator \u2013 Marcus (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc979885c\">Christoph Bach</a>), we end up in a bleak locked-room mystery unfolding in a locked mind.</p>\n<h4>Prisoner X</h4>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77725118483\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/prisoner-x-2015-001-old-man-with-gizmo.jpg?itok=Uegsm_sK\" alt=\"Prisoner X (2015)\" title=\"Prisoner X (2015)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77725118483\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/prisoner-x-2015-001-old-man-with-gizmo.jpg?itok=Uegsm_sK\" alt=\"Prisoner X (2015)\" title=\"Prisoner X (2015)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>There are several more variations on the locked-room mystery at this year\u2019s festival. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc92e6c10\">Gaurav Seth</a>\u2019s Prisoner X examines the post-9/11 global climate by showing a battle of wits between a CIA agent and a time-travelling, miracle-working PoW who, over the 15 years since his 2002 capture, from deep within the confines of his isolated high-security cell, has somehow been influencing a global terrorist revolution.

Arrow), and by night the dreamt-up half-memory of cafe barista Gabby (Cassandra Clark). Over the passing years Frank searches both his limited environment and his looping subconscious for a way out of these straitened (and gradually deteriorating) circumstances, the film locking him in a clever merger of Duncan Jones\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8c9a5891\">Moon</a> (2009) and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4f4b84eae02f8\">Source Code</a> (2011).

Here experimental filmmaker Jack (Alexander Jeremy) anonymously releases a new kind of feature that induces narcotic reveries in its viewers \u2013 only to find that his films\u2019 popularity attracts piracy and criminal takeover, even as his own overexposure to their hallucinogenic material is undermining his sense of self. The resulting <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b69593482\">Videodrome</a> update is a self-reflexive paranoia piece concerned all at once with the shrinking place of the auteur/artist in the public release and \u2018ownership\u2019 of a movie, with the death of film in the digital age and with the potentially dangerous repercussions of an art form that encourages narcissistic addictions and heady flights from reality.</p>\n<h4>Merge</h4>\n<p>Other films put the philosophy of mind and identity through genre\u2019s paces. In Justin Bull\u2019s Merge, for example, when adolescents in a small Vermont school start ingesting mind-altering (and crudely hacked) nanotechnology to improve their test grades, there are unforeseen consequences as their mental and emotional states blur into one collective, heralding a new stage in human evolution. Presented as a teen movie whose near-future technologies are grounded by snowy Vermont locations and kids just being kids, Bull\u2019s film speculates on what the next step might be in the social media-led race towards groupthink and the hive mind, and on how peer-group pressure and even mental illness might come to bear on any collective consciousness.</p>\n<h4>Identicals (aka Brand New-U)</h4>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7782546495\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/interiors-2015-001-passionate-kissing-against-mirror.jpg?itok=kzp61gT8\" alt=\"Interiors (aka Brand New-U, 2015)\" title=\"Interiors (aka Brand New-U, 2015)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7782546495\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/interiors-2015-001-passionate-kissing-against-mirror.jpg?itok=kzp61gT8\" alt=\"Interiors (aka Brand New-U, 2015)\" title=\"Interiors (aka Brand New-U, 2015)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bac2a7b22\">Simon Pummell</a>\u2019s Identicals posits a future where you can become a \u2018Brand New-U\u2019 (the film\u2019s original title), just so long as you are willing to kill your own past and never look back. After his girlfriend Nadia (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc9ca06d1\">Nora Jane Noone</a>) half-heartedly makes arrangements for a new identity in order to extract herself from their imperfect relationship, Slater (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4fbd5b5cecbdf\">Lachlan Nieboer</a>) finds himself the chief suspect in her murder, and has little choice but to change his own life \u2013 but he proves unable to put Nadia behind him, and so must come into violent confrontation with his other, equally conflicted parallel selves.</p>\n<p>With its SF concepts always remaining only vaguely defined, Identicals is best regarded as an extended metaphor exploring not only the adaptability but also the continuity demanded of personal identity amid radically changing circumstances. Think <a href=\"http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b8a02e9bd\">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a> (2004) reimagined as a coolly elegant, <em>noir</em>-shaded thriller \u2013 although with perhaps a little less coherence.</p>\n<h4>Tourbillon</h4>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"2.39700374532\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/tourbillon-2015-001-woman-with-gadget-lying-on-gravel.jpg?itok=J1XEc70a\" alt=\"Tourbillon (2015)\" title=\"Tourbillon (2015)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"2.39700374532\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/tourbillon-2015-001-woman-with-gadget-lying-on-gravel.jpg?itok=J1XEc70a\" alt=\"Tourbillon (2015)\" title=\"Tourbillon (2015)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>If Identicals is concerned with the multiple variant identities that make up a self, Gene Ivery\u2019s Tourbillon is instead preoccupied with the strange fixity of identity that comes with immortality. Ever since a genetic experiment in 1932 left Daniela (Cortney Palm) stuck in her youth, she has, over the passing decades, lost all sense of passion and purpose \u2013 a condition not helped by the sheltered existence she has been encouraged to lead by a family that may not always have her best interests at heart. Presented with the possibility of both an outside lover and an antidote to her everlasting life, Daniela is not sure who she can trust as she must make what is her first momentous decision in a very long time.</p>\n<p>Again, as with Identicals, Tourbillon offers the barebones of genre furnishings (world-changing science, cloak-and-dagger intrigue, dynastic tragedy), but for the most part it&#8217;s more interested in viewing the ephemerality of human endeavour from the perspective of eternity. Ivery shoots Daniela\u2019s experience with a naturalism that matches the quotidian quality found in her audio-diary entries, while simultaneously capturing her ever-adolescent disconnection from the norms of chronology through a fragmentary, time-leaping narrative structure.</p>\n<h4>Androids Dream (Sue\u00f1an los androides)</h4>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33286908078\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/androids-dream-2015-002-man-shooting-woman-on-hill.jpg?itok=FPAPt2zf\" alt=\"Androids Dream (Sue\u00f1an los androides, 2015)\" title=\"Androids Dream (Sue\u00f1an los androides, 2015)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33286908078\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/androids-dream-2015-002-man-shooting-woman-on-hill.jpg?itok=FPAPt2zf\" alt=\"Androids Dream (Sue\u00f1an los androides, 2015)\" title=\"Androids Dream (Sue\u00f1an los androides, 2015)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve reserved my two festival favourites till last. If <a href=\"http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b69ac89d8\">Blade Runner</a> (1982), in its various cuts, has proved to be one of science-fiction cinema\u2019s most influential works on memory and mortality, then Ion de Sosa\u2019s Androids Dream, drawn from Philip K. Dick\u2019s 1968 source novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, represents a strikingly improbable reimagining.</p>\n<p>The year may, as text at the beginning baldly states, be 2052, but Androids Dream has been shot on outmoded 16mm and in the concomitant, decidedly old-school Academy ratio \u2013 and its urban location is not some gaudy future-<em>noir</em> metropolis but the very recognisable high-rise of Benidorm, a once modernist city which has already seen better days. Here everything comes inscribed with a use-by date \u2013 and as the camera, pursuing a style midway between city-symphony documentary and family video, tracks ordinary people engaged in mundane activities, we see them shot down, one by one and without mercy, by a bounty hunter (Manolo Mar\u00edn) eager to purchase for himself one of the last sheep in existence.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if it dies? What guarantee do I have?\u201d, our murderous antihero asks the animal saleswoman, in words that resonate across time and space with Blade Runner\u2019s repeated line, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame she won\u2019t live \u2013 but then again, who does?\u201d It is a <em>memento mori</em> in a film where death comes swiftly and suddenly to everyone, and where the future represents little fundamental advance on the past.</p>\n<h4>Embers</h4>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.84830917874\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/embers-2015-001-woman-standing-amidst-house-rubble-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=s0_nJSIt\" alt=\"Embers (2015)\" title=\"Embers (2015)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.84830917874\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/embers-2015-001-woman-standing-amidst-house-rubble-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=s0_nJSIt\" alt=\"Embers (2015)\" title=\"Embers (2015)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Best of all, and also concerned with memory, is Claire Carr\u00e9\u2019s Embers, which envisages a post-apocalyptic society stripped of all working memory by a pandemic virus. A couple must rebuild their forgotten relationship every day. A man with no meaningful reference points tries to explain time and space to a child with no language \u2013 and, upon finding a discarded umbrella, launches into the dance sequence from <a href=\"http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6b6036b6\">Singin\u2019 in the Rain</a> (1952) with no idea why.</p>\n<p>A young thug is caught in a cycle of violence in which he is as much victim as perpetrator. An ageing academic creates a semblance of normalcy through reading and routine, and even tries to impart his knowledge to a younger stranger. And an adolescent woman \u2013 who has, since the outbreak, been living with her father in a minimalist bunker-cum-treasure-house \u2013 longs for raw world experience to complement her perfect recall.</p>\n<p>Whether you regard Embers as an Alzheimer\u2019s allegory or a broader investigation into the place of memory in our individual and cultural identity, Carr\u00e9 weaves from her ensemble amnesi-apocalypse a reflection of the human condition as philosophically compelling as it is emotionally intelligent, while celebrating our species\u2019 tenacious resilience, and optimistically implying that a flame can again be fanned from any embers. No film has either moved or provoked me as much this year.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/festivals/lost-inner-space-ten-highlights-sci-fi-london</link>\n   <author>Anton  Bitel</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/open-the-2015-001-two-figures-facing-off-in-watery-landscape_1000x750.jpg?itok=kNhiv-l0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Lost in inner space: ten highlights of Sci-Fi-London 2016]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/douglas-sirk-10-essential-films</guid>\n   <pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\n   <title>Douglas Sirk: 10 essential films</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;He may be best known for his melodrama masterpieces, but they are just the pinnacle of Douglas Sirk\u2019s remarkable career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"rss-content-container\"><p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.89545454545\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/imitation-of-life-1959-001-juanita-moore-talking-to-susan-kohner-on-street-at-night.jpg?itok=8vkSN9Ey\" alt=\"Imitation of Life (1959)\" title=\"Imitation of Life (1959)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.89545454545\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/imitation-of-life-1959-001-juanita-moore-talking-to-susan-kohner-on-street-at-night.jpg?itok=8vkSN9Ey\" alt=\"Imitation of Life (1959)\" title=\"Imitation of Life (1959)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Imitation of Life (1959)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1b82432\">Douglas Sirk</a> is so synonymous with 1950s melodrama that it is easy to forget that he made dozens of films across Germany, the Netherlands and the US before his brilliant run of so-called \u2018women\u2019s pictures\u2019, from <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a869a51\">All I Desire</a> (1953) to <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ad028a9\">Imitation of Life</a> (1959).</p>\n<p>Although critically derided, many of these melodramas were huge hits at the box office, making Sirk\u2019s decision to retire from filmmaking so early all the more surprising. In 1967 the French journal Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma reappraised Sirk\u2019s work, and he is now seen as one of cinema\u2019s great social critics. Cunningly, he chose melodramas (seen then as soapy concoctions for female audiences) as vehicles for his critiques, subtly dissecting prejudice and avarice under a seemingly innocuous surface. He has had a huge influence on directors such as Pedro Almod\u00f3var, Todd Haynes and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an astonishingly diverse career, featuring several undervalued collaborations with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ef163c6\">George Sanders</a>, a marvellously atmospheric chiller with a pre-superstardom <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ef85a91\">Lucille Ball</a> (1947\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b756cba8b\">Lured</a>) and \u2013 a real curio \u2013 a Dutch film called <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6f72b6e0\">Boefje</a> (1939) that\u00a0features 46-year-old actor Annie van Ees playing a 12-year-old boy. Some are flawed \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7be205\">Taza, Son of Conchise</a> (1954) is an unhappy western featuring white stars giving wooden performances as Native Americans, while <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a4be02e\">Battle Hymn</a> (1957), made during his otherwise terrific run in the late 1950s, is bland and schmaltzy.</p>\n<p>But while his later melodramas are the most celebrated, many of his earlier works are terrific in their own right, and show the roots of an interest in the themes that would be developed more fully in his final few masterpieces.</p>\n<h3>Zu neuen Ufern (1937)</h3>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.52538631347\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/zu-neuen-ufern-1937-001-female-prisoners-lying-down.jpg?itok=qDMrrfyw\" alt=\"Zu neuen Ufern (1937)\" title=\"Zu neuen Ufern (1937)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.52538631347\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/zu-neuen-ufern-1937-001-female-prisoners-lying-down.jpg?itok=qDMrrfyw\" alt=\"Zu neuen Ufern (1937)\" title=\"Zu neuen Ufern (1937)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Sirk\u2019s most interesting film for UFA (the leading German studio of its day used by the Nazis for its propaganda films) is a tale of a woman brought down by the inadequacy of men around her. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f6e2db6\">Zarah Leander</a> plays a singer in Victorian London, who takes the blame for the crimes of her aristocrat lover and is deported to Australia. When she is spurned by her former beau, her only hope to escape prison is if someone agrees to marry her. A local farmer takes pity on her \u2013 but will she become his wife?</p>\n<p>The film makes for interesting comparison with Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Under Capricorn (1949), which shares a similar central storyline. Sirk loved unconvincing \u2018happy\u2019 endings, and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bba10f1\">Zu neuen Ufern</a> has one of his best. Leander gives a strong performance as the desperate heroine.

Alas, he\u2019s a brute, but 10 years later she\u2019s still with him, refusing to leave her young son. Meanwhile, a deadly fever threatens the island, and two visiting doctors offer a chance of escape.</p>\n<p>La Habanera&#8217;s endorsement of the Nazi ideal of returning to your roots (or Heimat) and not giving in to foreign temptations make this a classic example of a nationalist UFA film.

She\u2019s brilliant, particularly in her wedding scene, where she is aware of the patronising scorn of the aristocrats around her, adding fuel to her plan to improve her station. George Sanders gives one of the best male performances in Sirk\u2019s canon, as the weak judge who falls in love with Olga.</p>\n<p>The critique of the limited options available to women is pure Sirk, while there is a moment of suspense that recalls Hitchcock, when a maid sees something disturbing from her changing room.

A few years ago, I saw Akira Kurosawa\u2019s 1957 classic Throne of Blood, inspired by Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. That film was my immediate inspiration. I read Macbeth many times and then started working with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc89298cd\">Abbas Tyrewala</a> to adapt the play.\u201d</p>\n<p>But that equally led to a film that is subversively critical of communal tensions in India. As <a href=\"http://www.borrowers.uga.edu/1408/show\">Blair Orffal notes</a>, Bhardwaj \u201cchannels Macbeth via Throne of Blood to stage a specific historic negotiation and representation of minority Islamic culture within India as Hindu fundamentalism threatens to overrun the once diverse city of Mumbai.\u201d Drawing on Kurosawa\u2019s mixed genres of tragedy and ethnography, Bhardwaj \u201ccreates a tragic ethnography to memorialize Mumbai as a city with threatened shores.\u201d</p>\n<p>In Maqbool, Abbaji/Duncan is a patriotic Muslim Indian, despite being the patriarch of the Mumbai underworld; Bhardwaj\u2019s attention to the costume, accent, food, architecture and <em>tehzeeb</em> (culture and etiquette) typical of this culture is pointed and nostalgic. The film suggests, in its rich colouring and lilting music, a waning Muslim milieu in the wider context of India comparable to Kurosawa\u2019s post-war chronicling of <em>Noh</em> theatre traditions specifically, and a period of Japanese samurai history generally.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/omkara-2006-001-couple-faces-close-up-in-dark.jpg?itok=xSXR4fPs\" alt=\"Omkara (2006), Vishal Bhardwaj&amp;amp;#8217;s &amp;amp;lsquo;post-postcolonial&amp;amp;rsquo; take on Othello\" title=\"Omkara (2006), Vishal Bhardwaj&amp;amp;#8217;s &amp;amp;lsquo;post-postcolonial&amp;amp;rsquo; take on Othello\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/omkara-2006-001-couple-faces-close-up-in-dark.jpg?itok=xSXR4fPs\" alt=\"Omkara (2006), Vishal Bhardwaj&amp;amp;#8217;s &amp;amp;lsquo;post-postcolonial&amp;amp;rsquo; take on Othello\" title=\"Omkara (2006), Vishal Bhardwaj&amp;amp;#8217;s &amp;amp;lsquo;post-postcolonial&amp;amp;rsquo; take on Othello\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Omkara (2006), Vishal Bhardwaj&#8217;s &lsquo;post-postcolonial&rsquo; take on Othello</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Bhardwaj\u2019s second Shakespeare film, Omkara, premiered at Cannes and positions itself within the annals of global adaptations of Othello such those by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b257773\">Orson Welles</a> in 1952, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b257463\">Lawrence Olivier</a> in 1965 and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7e4cfb32\">Oliver Parker</a> in 1995. By doing this, the film sidesteps the long and complicated history that Othello has in India, beginning with the infamous San Souci Production of 1848, when the lead was played, as the fly bill announced, by a \u2018Native Gentleman\u2019, the Bengali actor Baishnab Charan Adhya. He took the lead in a time when white actors blacking up was the norm for the civilised audience attending the colonial theatre.</p>\n<p>Working within mainstream commercial film industries, Sen, Jayaraj and Bhardwaj not only approach Shakespeare as original material through which they can hold a mirror up to the world, they also open up new ways of interpreting the original texts within more modern contexts. They break with the tradition of Indian Shakespeares on screen by adapting full texts rather than merely referencing the plays, and by delving into the tragic genre, a category that is rare in Indian literature and art. They do this perhaps because times have changed \u2013 perhaps this is a post-postcolonial world and the genre of the Shakespearean tragedy, unlike others including realist film, provides the structure and distance to mourn the loss of the recent past \u2013 lost due to the homogenising effects of globalisation.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t recognise their antecedents. There were three main routes through which Shakespeare permeated the Indian film industries: the literary absorption of Shakespeare after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Education_Act_1835\">English Education Act of 1835</a>, Hollywood and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsi_theatre\">Parsi theatre</a>. The latter form flourished between the 1850s and 1930s and was a forerunner to Bollywood, with its entertainment-driven format combining folk and musical theatre traditions with Gujrati, Hindi and Urdu influences.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/haider-2014-002-haider-foreground-against-stone-temple-with-dancers.jpg?itok=8kKIVtzZ\" alt=\"Shahid Kapoor as the title character of Bhardwaj&amp;amp;#8217;s Hamlet adaptation Haider (2014)\" title=\"Shahid Kapoor as the title character of Bhardwaj&amp;amp;#8217;s Hamlet adaptation Haider (2014)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/haider-2014-002-haider-foreground-against-stone-temple-with-dancers.jpg?itok=8kKIVtzZ\" alt=\"Shahid Kapoor as the title character of Bhardwaj&amp;amp;#8217;s Hamlet adaptation Haider (2014)\" title=\"Shahid Kapoor as the title character of Bhardwaj&amp;amp;#8217;s Hamlet adaptation Haider (2014)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Shahid Kapoor as the title character of Bhardwaj&#8217;s Hamlet adaptation Haider (2014)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>All these are critiqued in Bhardwaj\u2019s most recent film <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/543315a6f244e\">Haider</a> (2014), a Hindi/English-language version of Hamlet set in Kashmir. Its Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Salman and Salman, two corrupt stooges in the pay of the occupying force of the Indian Army, who own a video shop and are obsessed with the real-life actor <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba9ceaeff\">Salman Khan</a>. They mimic his Bollywood dances, then have to persuade well-meaning Western tourists to rent one of his films by telling them how famous the multi-box office busting megastar actually is. As it happens, Salman Khan\u2019s own breakthrough film <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7acb2775\">Maine Pyar Kiya</a> (1989), which Salman and Salman love, is a thinly veiled Romeo and Juliet (though of course with a happy ending).</p>\n<p>Haider also pillories the legacies of colonialism, rhyming \u2018chutzpah\u2019 with AFSPA in reference to a colonial-era law (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_(Special_Powers)_Act\">Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act</a>) that continues to allow the Indian Army to act with impunity against the Muslim citizens of Kashmir. As in Omkara, Bhardwaj sneaks this critique in; it doesn\u2019t have to be explicit given that earlier makers such as Ajoy Kar, in Saptapadi (The Seven Steps of Marriage, 1961), have already used Othello as metaphor for the struggle to establish an Indian national identity against the British.</p>\n<p>Shakespeare has been appropriated not only for postcolonial critique but also to examine the relationship between different Indian identities since Independence. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba7b425da\">T. Prakash Rao</a>\u2019s 1968 Izzat focuses on the marginalisation and exploitation of the <em>adivasis</em> (tribal people) by the rich <em>zamindars</em> (landlords) and again uses Othello to comment on the colour, caste and class prejudices that still exist in India today. And one of the first appropriations of Romeo and Juliet to be set in contemporary times, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b89280407\">Ek Duuje Ke Liye</a> (1977), locates the star-crossed lovers within an issue of contention that is rarely addressed on film: the differences between North Indian and South Indian language and culture.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/ek-duuje-ke-liye-1977-couple-by-shore-waves.jpg?itok=t9Xq_9Ss\" alt=\"K.

Meanwhile Shakespearean offshoots such as Merchant-Ivory\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b59e9cc\">Shakespeare Wallah</a>\u00a0(1965), Sen\u2019s own\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6991db23\">36 Chowringhee Lane</a>\u00a0(1981) and Rituparno Ghosh\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8c785d0b\">The Last Lear</a>\u00a0(2007) critique Raj-era nostalgia and its hangovers and use Shakespeare to comment on the demise of Empire and commercial film taking over from theatre as India\u2019s most popular art form.</p>\n<p>Like Bhardwaj\u2019s Maqbool, many of these films are also set in Mumbai, heart of the Bollywood film industry. The city will also form the backdrop to The Hungry, a new version of Shakespeare\u2019s most bloody tragedy, Titus Andronicus. Directed by Bornila Chatterjee and scheduled to shoot later this year, the film is the winner of Film London\u2019s 2015 <a href=\"http://filmlondon.org.uk/india\">Microwave India scheme</a>, for which Bhardwaj is the patron. What will a female director from the Indian diaspora make of this tale of brutal rape, silencing, murder, racism and cannabalism in Mumbai\u2019s vast metropolis? If this film takes Bhardwaj\u2019s cue, expect linguistic hybridity, gritty violence, corruption, family intrigue and lots and lots of blood, shot lyrically, with a poetic sense of landscape devoid of the exoticisation with which India is usually viewed through Western eyes. And what will the Indian censor make of that?</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/shakespeare-indian-screen</link>\n   <author>Koel  Chatterjee</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/haider-2014-001-man-holding-skull-aloft_1000x750.jpg?itok=S3M0sJ5N\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Bleed, bleed, poor country: Shakespeare on the Indian screen]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/features/night-will-fall-among-documentary-winners-peabody-awards</guid>\n   <pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\n   <title>Night Will Fall among documentary winners at the Peabody Awards</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;America&amp;#8217;s Peabody Awards have now announced this year&amp;#8217;s winners in the documentary category.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"rss-content-container\"><p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/night-will-fall-2014-soldier-with-camera-001.jpg?itok=QTg4gqGf\" alt=\"Night Will Fall (2014)\" title=\"Night Will Fall (2014)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/night-will-fall-2014-soldier-with-camera-001.jpg?itok=QTg4gqGf\" alt=\"Night Will Fall (2014)\" title=\"Night Will Fall (2014)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Night Will Fall (2014)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The final group of winners of this year\u2019s Peabody Awards have been announced by the University of Georgia.

How tantalising then\u00a0to remember that the date of Cervantes\u2019 death 400 years ago in April 1616 is the day before that given for his opposite number in the English language: <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f9d85bd\">William Shakespeare</a>.</p>\n<p>But while the bard is the most adapted writer in the history of cinema, those filmmakers drawn to tackling Don Quixote on screen have, time and again, found themselves tilting at windmills. Here are some of the more notable cinematic Quixote projects.</p>\n<h3>Orson Welles and Quixote</h3>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.36157337368\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/don-quixote-1957-001-orson-welles-version-quixote-horseback-00n-7r3.jpg?itok=7uIrEQwH\" alt=\"Don Quixote (1957, unfinished)\" title=\"Don Quixote (1957, unfinished)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.36157337368\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/don-quixote-1957-001-orson-welles-version-quixote-horseback-00n-7r3.jpg?itok=7uIrEQwH\" alt=\"Don Quixote (1957, unfinished)\" title=\"Don Quixote (1957, unfinished)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Don Quixote (1957, unfinished)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Having been removed by Hollywood studio bosses from the final edit of his film Touch of Evil, Welles quit town and headed for Mexico where he began the torturous, decades-spanning production of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b70dbbb9e\">Don Quixote</a>. The self-financed film remained unfinished upon Welles\u2019s death in 1985. By then he had amassed 300,000 feet of film. Welles never completed what he considered a definitive adaptation.</p>\n<p>In 1992 film director Jess Franco and associate Patxi Irigoyen \u2018restored\u2019 the film but not to any great acclaim. The print was impoverished and lacked clarity and Welles\u2019s commentary and dialogue had been ineffectively dubbed into Spanish.</p>\n<p>Welles\u2019s original conceit turned on the idea that Quixote and Sancho Panza actually exist in the 20th century. One scene depicts Quixote and Sancho in a cinema. Quixote sits very still, captivated by the moving images. When a lavish battle scene fills the knight\u2019s view, Quixote rushes to the screen, raises his sword at the action and finally slashes into the screen. Fantasy and reality are hard to distinguish: the blessing and curse of cinema, perhaps.</p>\n<h3>The Crimean Quixote</h3>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/don-quixote-1957-1957-kozintsev-version-quixote-horseback.jpg?itok=-MigkcD6\" alt=\"Don Quixote (1957)\" title=\"Don Quixote (1957)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/don-quixote-1957-1957-kozintsev-version-quixote-horseback.jpg?itok=-MigkcD6\" alt=\"Don Quixote (1957)\" title=\"Don Quixote (1957)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Don Quixote (1957)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>In 1957 a lush Russian version of the novel was released. It\u2019s now considered the best Quixote adaptation yet made. Directed by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba88c3a07\">Grigori Kozintsev</a> (who also made excellent versions of Shakespeare&#8217;s Hamlet and King Lear for the screen) and shot on location in the Crimea, the film was the first colour film version of Quixote to have been produced. It\u2019s hugely entertaining and quite beautiful too, getting at the novel\u2019s weave of broad comedy and pathos.</p>\n<p>The film has a very deliberate pace and its use of Russian rather than Spanish lends the performances naturalism and authenticity. Understandably abbreviating the immense novel, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a919698\">the film</a> nonetheless brings vivid life to the key sequences.</p>\n<h3>Walt Disney and Quixote</h3>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.18694362018\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/disney-horvath-don-quixote-conept-art-1929-001.jpg?itok=Q9ipX5CV\" alt=\"Concept art by Ferdinand Horvath for an unrealised Disney version of Don Quixote, 1929\" title=\"Concept art by Ferdinand Horvath for an unrealised Disney version of Don Quixote, 1929\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.18694362018\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/disney-horvath-don-quixote-conept-art-1929-001.jpg?itok=Q9ipX5CV\" alt=\"Concept art by Ferdinand Horvath for an unrealised Disney version of Don Quixote, 1929\" title=\"Concept art by Ferdinand Horvath for an unrealised Disney version of Don Quixote, 1929\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Concept art by Ferdinand Horvath for an unrealised Disney version of Don Quixote, 1929</span><br />\n              <span class=\"copy\">Credit: Disney</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba14616dc\">Walt Disney</a> recognised the possibilities in adapting the Cervantes novel and, over several decades, tried to manifest Quixote in animated form. It\u2019s highly likely that a Quixote adaptation was developed as one of the Disney studio\u2019s Silly Symphony shorts. Studio artist Ferdinand Horvath rendered a wonderfully vivid set of concept sketches, including one of Quixote armoured-up, looking out at us from the page. Another Horvath image gets at the heart of Quixote, showing him lost in his reading by candlelight.</p>\n<p>Conceptual art for a feature film was further developed in 1940; its visual approach partly informed by the work of Spanish artist Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. However, the limited film distribution patterns occasioned by the Second World War, combined with the commercial failure of Pinocchio (1940) and Fantasia (1940), interrupted development.</p>\n<p>Another attempt, made in 1946, focused on adapting Richard Strauss\u2019s 1897 tone poem Don Quixote: Fantastic Variations on a Theme of Knightly Character for Large Orchestra. Again, the project didn\u2019t cohere. In 1951 the Disney studio tried again, this time exploring an increasingly simple visual design. A striking concept art from this go-round shows Quixote on his horse riding towards windmills that have transmogrified into truly monstrous forms. As recently as the late 1990s another attempt was made but was abandoned, studio heads considering it too adult.</p>\n<h3>Terry Gilliam and Quixote</h3>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.737559645535\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/lost-in-la-macha-2002-001-quixote-drawing-00m-sh1.jpg?itok=D36annxm\" alt=\"Drawing for Terry Gilliam&amp;#039;s version of Don Quixote, from Lost in La Mancha (2002)\" title=\"Drawing for Terry Gilliam&amp;#039;s version of Don Quixote, from Lost in La Mancha (2002)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"0.737559645535\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/lost-in-la-macha-2002-001-quixote-drawing-00m-sh1.jpg?itok=D36annxm\" alt=\"Drawing for Terry Gilliam&amp;#039;s version of Don Quixote, from Lost in La Mancha (2002)\" title=\"Drawing for Terry Gilliam&amp;#039;s version of Don Quixote, from Lost in La Mancha (2002)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Drawing for Terry Gilliam's version of Don Quixote, from Lost in La Mancha (2002)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba15820bc\">Terry Gilliam</a>\u2019s affinity for the figure of Don Quixote, and the ideas embodied by the character, have manifested themselves in each of his movies, and since 1991, Gilliam has wrestled to bring Cervantes\u2019 novel to the screen. Gilliam\u2019s initial, ultimately beleaguered, attempt is captured in the documentary <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b87ad4812\">Lost in La Mancha</a> (2002). We see weather besiege Gilliam\u2019s location with a flash flood. Then the film unit discovers that one of their locations is sited below a Spanish Air Force flight path. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1aa158e\">Jean Rochefort</a>, portraying Quixote, is stricken with illness. Beyond these hurdles, the documentary also offers us a palpable sense of Gilliam\u2019s overarching creative ambition and the tone he was attempting to strike. At the time he described it as \u201cQuixote through the looking glass\u201d. Determinedly, Gilliam is currently developing a revised take on his original concept for The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.</p>\n<h3>The \u2018slow cinema\u2019 Quixote</h3>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.69428571429\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/honour-of-the-knights-2006-001-sancho-and-quixote-in-field-lopsided-sky.jpg?itok=K9JpS7T9\" alt=\"Honour of the Knights (2006)\" title=\"Honour of the Knights (2006)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.69428571429\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/honour-of-the-knights-2006-001-sancho-and-quixote-in-field-lopsided-sky.jpg?itok=K9JpS7T9\" alt=\"Honour of the Knights (2006)\" title=\"Honour of the Knights (2006)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Honour of the Knights (2006)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>It seems fitting that the most notable recent attempt to bring Quixote to the screen should have come from Spain itself, even if filmmaker <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd8339b35\">Albert Serra</a> made the provocative decision to use dialogue in his native Catalan rather than Spanish. His visually superb, minimalist <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8bc52c96\">Honour of the Knights</a> (2006) won\u2019t be the Quixote film for everyone: for much of the running time Quixote and Panza are seen aimlessly lying around in parched fields, as Serra strips the adventure back to its sparse, diurnal rhythms, with little action beyond the evident camaraderie between the two men. But this is a low-budget Quixote for the digital age, distilling much of the essence of the novel in a manner that had eluded some filmmakers with more money to spend.</p>\n<p>Will Quixote again find a 21st century home on screen?

German humour, for example, is often ridiculed on these shores as an oxymoron. As for the French, well, any nation that has adopted Jerry Lewis as the pinnacle of their own foreign comedy appreciation, is seen as lacking a certain je ne sais quoi.</p>\n<p>If humour, more than many genres, can be a poor traveller, for linguistic as well as cultural reasons, many times funny is simply universal. With that in mind, this year\u2019s LOCO \u2013 the London Comedy Film Festival \u2013 has dedicated a section, \u2018Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, Hilarit\u00e9\u2019 to French film comedy. Along with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1c57f9e\">Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut</a>\u2019s collected adventures of Antoine Doinel, there are five new efforts to enjoy. And the strand\u2019s appearance is no coincidence, according to LOCO programmer Jonathan Wakeham.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a very clear purpose after the Charlie Hebdo and Paris attacks last year,\u201d says Wakeham. \u201cFrance had had an incredibly painful year and to celebrate the best of French culture is a reminder that it\u2019s not about fear, it\u2019s about liberty, kindness, humour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd in the year of the EU referendum,\u201d he adds, \u201cwe wanted to celebrate the relationship between Britain and France, two countries with an inherent comic sensibility.\u201d With that in mind, here are 10 examples \u2013 among many, many other candidates \u2013 of the very best of French film comedy through the years; some no doubt familiar, others hopefully less so \u2013 at least on these shores \u2013 and therefore ripe for discovery.</p>\n<h3>Le Million (1931)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0<span>Ren\u00e9 Clair</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.36787762906\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/million-le-1931-001-man-and-ballerina-00n-e6s.jpg?itok=BplJ0wlf\" alt=\"Le Million (1931)\" title=\"Le Million (1931)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.36787762906\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/million-le-1931-001-man-and-ballerina-00n-e6s.jpg?itok=BplJ0wlf\" alt=\"Le Million (1931)\" title=\"Le Million (1931)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t just <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9efe2680\">Charlie Chaplin</a> who was unimpressed by the advent of the \u2018talkies\u2019. One of France\u2019s guiding cinematic lights, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba138b568\">Ren\u00e9 Clair</a>, also dismissed the vogue for obediently stuffing films with dialogue, which he considered a poor replacement for cinema\u2019s visual potential. Then, with a virtuoso flourish, in only his own second talking picture (a stage adaptation, no less), about the hunt for a missing winning lottery ticket, Clair showed everyone just how innovatively and wittily sound could be used: replacing much of the play\u2019s dialogue with songs, adding a chorus, and experimenting with sound effects that would seem daring even today \u2013 for example, scoring the frantic climactic scramble for the coat containing the missing ticket with the sounds of a raucous stadium crowd.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s much, much more to <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b74492e49\">Le Million</a>, from its justly famous, swoonsome Parisian rooftop opening tracking shot, to the sheer punch-drunk infectiousness of its community sing-a-longs. In fact, the film overall is so vivacious and light on its feet, it\u2019s only afterwards that you realise you\u2019ve been watching a sly dig at class warfare and greed, for money and for love itself.</p>\n<h3>Jour de f\u00eate (1949)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0<span>Jacques Tati</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5076142132\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/jour-de-fete-1949-011-jacques-tati-on-his-bike-overtakes-cyclists.jpg?itok=8xQXyMcl\" alt=\"Jour de f\u00eate (1949)\" title=\"Jour de f\u00eate (1949)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5076142132\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/jour-de-fete-1949-011-jacques-tati-on-his-bike-overtakes-cyclists.jpg?itok=8xQXyMcl\" alt=\"Jour de f\u00eate (1949)\" title=\"Jour de f\u00eate (1949)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1c10de8\">Jacques Tati</a> before Monsieur Hulot, but still evincing his desire to perfect routines and scenarios already well-developed \u2013 in this case, from his short film <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6e3176dd\">L\u2019Ecole des facteurs</a> (1947), which also featured him as postman Fran\u00e7ois. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7324bba1\">Jour de f\u00eate</a>\u2019s sleepy French country village charms provide the ideal contrast to Fran\u00e7ois\u2019s mission to ape the \u201cAmerican-style\u201d hi-tech postal deliveries he\u2019s seen in a promo film. Though perhaps not as disciplined here as in his later work, Tati is already honing his more dialogue-free, visual humour, a series of loosely linked comic vignettes in which his relaxed master shots allow jokes to unfold naturally. It\u2019s the play time before <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b3291db\">Play Time</a> (1967).</p>\n<p>Three versions of Jour de f\u00eate are still readily available: the black-and-white 1949 release; the rejigged 1964 version complete with added visiting painter\u2019s narration and splashes of hand-drawn colour; and the 1995 reissue, restored to its originally intended colour palette. All three have their charms (though for me, removing the anachronistic 60s artist is a definite improvement) and give a great account of one of French cinema\u2019s masters forging his identity.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/users-guide-modern-world-according-jacques-tati\">A user\u2019s guide to the modern world... according to Jacques Tati</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/news/painting-town-tatis-jour-de-fete-colour\">Painting the town: Tati\u2019s Jour de f\u00eate in colour</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Zazie dans le m\u00e9tro (1960)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Louis Malle</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.78481012658\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/zazie-dans-le-metro-1960-002-philippe-noiret-catherine-demongeot.jpg?itok=8vSZ0JBa\" alt=\"Zazie dans le metro (1960)\" title=\"Zazie dans le metro (1960)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.78481012658\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/zazie-dans-le-metro-1960-002-philippe-noiret-catherine-demongeot.jpg?itok=8vSZ0JBa\" alt=\"Zazie dans le metro (1960)\" title=\"Zazie dans le metro (1960)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The French new wave is celebrated for many things, though perhaps less so for out-and-out comedy. Here, then, is the corrective: <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f075360\">Louis Malle</a>\u2019s madcap, chaotic <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bb8a302\">adaptation</a> of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2baa3f3b9b\">Raymond Queneau</a>\u2019s so-called unfilmable novel, about a bolshie 11-year-old (the impishly charming <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba420a802\">Catherine Demongeot</a>) who is palmed off on her ne\u2019er-do-well uncle (a young <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba197582b\">Philippe Noiret</a>) in Paris while her mother enjoys a romantic rendezvous. Fizzing with visual trickery \u2013 jump cuts, fast-motion \u2013 that often evokes a Chuck Jones cartoon made flesh, and brimming with wordplay and inventive slang, it turns late-1950s Paris into a vibrant playground where every adult seems emotionally less stable than young Zazie, who cheerfully calls them on their immaturity, while indulging her own.</p>\n<p>In fact, for a comedy, there\u2019s a deep melancholy at Zazie\u2019s core. Malle keeps the pace so relentless amid the food fights, casual vandalism and va-va-voom that it\u2019s entirely possible to completely overlook the questioning self-critique of Paris chic, its denizens\u2019 obsession with sex and even the new wave itself altogether.

Starring <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1c8dfcd\">Lino Ventura</a> as an ex-gangster pulled back into the underworld by his dying boss, it\u2019s a droll look at competing mobsters all vying for top-dog position, while Ventura himself spends as much time trying to keep his boss\u2019s daughter, a self-declared good-time-girl, out of trouble as he does from avoiding gangland mutiny.</p>\n<p>If the film hasn\u2019t caught on outside France, it may be that Audiard\u2019s famous way with piquant slang can be tricky to adequately translate (a point in case: English title \u2018Monsieur Gangster\u2019 is as anodyne as they come). What\u2019s much easier to appreciate are Ventura\u2019s nimble comic timing despite his lugubrious heft, a justly renowned moonshine drinking scene and an escalating sense of farce that threatens to overrun the gangsters\u2019 need to keep up their image of control.</p>\n<h3>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director\u00a0</strong>Luis Bu\u00f1uel</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.51918158568\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/discreet-charm-of-the-bourgeoisie-the-1972-001-people-sitting-around-table-listening-to-police-officer.jpg?itok=-CHsOlPD\" alt=\"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972)\" title=\"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.51918158568\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/discreet-charm-of-the-bourgeoisie-the-1972-001-people-sitting-around-table-listening-to-police-officer.jpg?itok=-CHsOlPD\" alt=\"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972)\" title=\"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>In 1962, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba130b1ef\">Luis Bu\u00f1uel</a> made <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b995895\">The Exterminating Angel</a>, a Spanish-language surrealist farce about guests who find themselves unable to leave an upper-class dinner party. A decade later, he came to France and flipped the concept to arguably even more potent effect: six snobs repeatedly foiled in their attempts to enjoy a meal together, be it due to wrong dates, dead restaurant managers, even a military intervention. At one point the hapless sextet find their meal actually taking place on a stage.</p>\n<p>Melding dream sequences to \u2018reality\u2019 without warning and conjuring up ghosts, this is late-period Bu\u00f1uel at his most devilish, denying his outwardly civilised, inherently entitled characters their rightful place at society\u2019s table, while gleefully exposing their hypocrisy and corruption for all to see.

A film that flopped on its initial release, only to gain a cult following and dialogue that its fans can quote by heart? <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7569375a\">Le P\u00e8re No\u00ebl est une ordure</a>, or Santa Claus Is a Stinker (\u201cstinker\u201d being a kind translation), is that film, in spirit if not precise tone or plot. It\u2019s a Christmas tradition in many French households, which joyfully revels in showing the season of goodwill and generosity as tinsel-topped egotism.</p>\n<p>Based on a play by comedy troupe Le Splendid \u2013 whose members including <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1391ee5\">Christian Clavier</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1207441\">Josiane Balasko</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1802d3b\">Thierry Lhermitte</a> went on to become major French stars \u2013 it\u2019s set in the office of a telephone helpline on Christmas Eve, where two hapless employees struggle to deal with visitors including a depressed transvestite, an abused pregnant woman and her pursuing husband, a volatile, department store Santa Claus with a gun. The escalating chain of catastrophes, which result in needing to dispose of an unexpected corpse, are a delightful mix of outrageous slapstick and some very deft one-liners from a game and shameless ensemble.</p>\n<h3>Delicatessen (1991)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro</span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.87020648968\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/delicatessen-1991-001-dominique-pinon-with-butcher-knife-in-his-head.jpg?itok=Q5QLQdUJ\" alt=\"Delicatessen (1991)\" title=\"Delicatessen (1991)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.87020648968\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/delicatessen-1991-001-dominique-pinon-with-butcher-knife-in-his-head.jpg?itok=Q5QLQdUJ\" alt=\"Delicatessen (1991)\" title=\"Delicatessen (1991)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>A rundown, post-apocalyptic cityscape rendered in hues of tobacco stains and smoke, where people resort to cannibalism to survive. It\u2019s the set-up for a horror film, but in the hands of debut filmmakers <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba2f6ad1a\">Marc Caro</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba16cf196\">Jean-Pierre Jeunet</a> \u2013 who seem equally inspired by bande dessin\u00e9e panels, silent cinema storytelling, Heath Robinson invention and Terry Gilliam-esque absurdity (Gilliam co-produces here) \u2013 it\u2019s the basis for a singular, blackly comic fantasy.</p>\n<p>Centred around a malevolent butcher, his sweet-natured daughter and the clown who comes both to town and between them, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7b3bbccc\">Delicatessen</a> is as much about its mood and look as its trippy narrative. Calibrated with fastidious precision, its anarchic, inventive spirit is perhaps encapsulated by the acclaimed scene where, as the butcher makes love to his girlfriend, the squeaking springs on his bed gradually synchronise the entire block\u2019s activities in time to their increasing tempo. Caro and Jeunet\u2019s gift is one of oppositions: framing beauty in squalor, finding the heart and humour in the grimmest of fairytale worlds.</p>\n<h3>The Taste of Others (2000)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0<span>Agn\u00e8s Jaoui</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.78390804598\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/taste-of-otheres-the-2000-001-anne-alvaro-tea-and-cake.jpg?itok=XSDrTcmU\" alt=\"The Taste of Others (2000)\" title=\"The Taste of Others (2000)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.78390804598\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/taste-of-otheres-the-2000-001-anne-alvaro-tea-and-cake.jpg?itok=XSDrTcmU\" alt=\"The Taste of Others (2000)\" title=\"The Taste of Others (2000)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Director <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bab6e80c1\">Agn\u00e8s Jaoui</a> and her co-writer (and frequent co-star) <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba11efde3\">Jean-Pierre Bacri</a> had written award-winning plays and film scripts before Jaoui\u2019s bittersweet, witty and wonderfully astute feature film debut swept the C\u00e9sars at the turn of the new millennium. An ensemble tale revolving around a middle-aged, conservative businessman Castella (Bacri) and his sudden aesthetic awakening (inspired by falling for his English teacher), <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b82f3cd6c\">The Taste of Others</a> (Le Go\u00fbt des autres) uses the idea of one\u2019s artistic taste as the launch pad for a wider examination of all those presentation choices we make about ourselves in order to be seen as objects of, if not, outright beauty, then of desire or value.</p>\n<p>The narrative deftly weaves among its idiosyncratic though precisely delineated characters (Jaoui as a pot-dealing barmaid, the great <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bae8de024\">Alain Chabat</a> as Castella\u2019s clarinet-playing driver), but it\u2019s the peerless Bacri who steals the show. Comparisons to Woody Allen were flattering if unsurprising, though in truth it\u2019s been a long while since Allen pulled off something as sophisticated and soulful as this (or Jaoui and Bacri\u2019s 2004 follow-up Look at Me).</p>\n<h3>OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies (2006)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0<span>Michel Hazanavicius</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.50570342205\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/oss-117-cairo-nest-of-spies-2006-001-jean-dujardin.jpg?itok=M6WfKWpZ\" alt=\"OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies (2006)\" title=\"OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies (2006)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.50570342205\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/oss-117-cairo-nest-of-spies-2006-001-jean-dujardin.jpg?itok=M6WfKWpZ\" alt=\"OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies (2006)\" title=\"OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies (2006)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Before The Artist (2011) became an unexpected global hit and awards magnet, director <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bbaca9d1d\">Michel Hazanavicius</a> and stars <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bce2aa31e\">Jean Dujardin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bb43ac74c\">B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo</a> teamed up to pay tribute to another 20th-century period and movie genre, with the first in a series of stylish spy spoofs. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2baac64a18\">Jean Bruce</a>\u2019s source novels actually predate Ian Fleming\u2019s 007, but the movie at least unerringly targets an inch-perfect recreation of Connery-era Bond. Agent 117 is a strutting buffoon who loves his job, French colonialism run amok, and the film has great fun sending up the racism, sexism and unwitting homoeroticism of the times, as 117 tries to infiltrate a Cairo riddled with radical locals and devious Nazis.</p>\n<p>Some bizarrely inspired set pieces \u2013 a fight involving throwing live chickens is a highlight \u2013 actually defuse the daring in its post-9/11 allegory of Arab world meddling. Instead, it\u2019s more a showcase for the wonderful Dujardin, blessed with prime Connery looks and physique, plus crack comic timing and a willingness to send himself up. The Artist confirmed that there are few sight gags more appealing than watching Jean Dujardin throw back his head in toothy bonhomie, but <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8ba3b7ab\">OSS 117</a> is where he first left many of us shaken and stirred with laughter.</p>\n<h3>The Names of Love (2010)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0<span>Michel Leclerc</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.63326446281\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/names-of-love-2010-001-wedding.jpg?itok=mvSukmdq\" alt=\"The Names of Love (2010)\" title=\"The Names of Love (2010)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.63326446281\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/names-of-love-2010-001-wedding.jpg?itok=mvSukmdq\" alt=\"The Names of Love (2010)\" title=\"The Names of Love (2010)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The romcom has \u2013 rightfully \u2013 taken a pounding of late, audiences tired of its rote manoeuvres. This French take, then, is a breath of fresh air for the genre, as a free-spirited half-Algerian French woman who sleeps with right-wingers to change their political views, falls for an overly cautious, middle-aged avian flu specialist. As much as any meet-cute or belated realisation that an unlikely couple are made for each other, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8de0837c\">The Names of Love</a> constantly foregrounds questioning of politics, of racial heritage, and of cultural identity, and the film is all the stronger for it.</p>\n<p>A note of caution is worth flagging, given the female lead\u2019s self-proclaimed status as a \u201cpolitical whore\u201d and her frequent disrobing. But C\u00e9sar-winner <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bcd345f9d\">Sara Forestier</a>\u2019s guileless, wired performance creates something much more than a patented male fantasy \u201cmanic pixie dream girl\u201d, and screenwriters <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2be28ebcf2\">Baya Kasmi</a> and director <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd92e7d27\">Michel Leclerc</a>\u2019s daring use of tropes like the Holocaust and paedophilia for the bedrock to their character\u2019s hang-ups, shows they have more on their mind than romance and comedy. The paradoxical result is one of the best modern romcoms and well worth seeking out. (Leclerc\u2019s follow-up, La Vie tr\u00e8s priv\u00e9e de Monsieur Sim, starring the wonderful Jean-Pierre Bacri, is one of LOCO\u2019s French highlights).</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-french-comedy-films</link>\n   <author>Leigh  Singer</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/stolen-kisses-1968-001-jean-pierre-leaud-reading-bed-1000x750.jpg?itok=EoLgXp20\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[10 great French comedy films]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n </channel>\n</rss>\n",
