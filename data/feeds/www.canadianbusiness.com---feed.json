A screening system problem that caused more than 3,000 checked bags to miss their outbound flights in Phoenix has been fixed, officials with Transportation Security Administration said.</p>\n<p>The baggage-screening systems at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport will be tested throughout the night in preparation for Friday&#8217;s scheduled operations, according to TSA spokesman Nico Melendez.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are cautiously optimistic that it will be fully operational in the morning,&#8221; Melendez said. Additional canine units from other airports and network specialists will be on hand in case any problems arise, he added.</p>\n<p>The problem began at about 6:45 a.m. and only affected Sky Harbor.</p>\n<p>Julie Rodriguez, a Sky Harbor spokeswoman, said the problem existed in all three of the airport&#8217;s terminals.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately known how many of the airport&#8217;s 16 airlines were affected but Melendez said Southwest was significantly impacted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are not seeing widespread flight delays, but many checked bags are missing flights,&#8221; Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>According to the TSA, the inline baggage systems handle the bulk of checked luggage. When everything is working properly only about 10 per cent of all checked bags are hand-searched by TSA officers.</p>\n<p>Workers loaded hundreds of bags onto semi-trailers Thursday evening. Rodriguez said those bags were slated for ground transportation to airports in Tucson and San Diego and then would be screened and flown to their destinations.</p>\n<p>Cody Desjadon, 22, of Prescott, Arizona, arrived at the airport shortly after 5 p.m. and knew something was off when he saw a parking lot full of police, dogs, and suitcases. He and his girlfriend, Hannah Brinser, 19, then learned at a Southwest ticket counter that her large suitcase would take two to three days to get to their destination in Missouri.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our trip is three days,&#8221; Desjadon said.</p>\n<p>The couple&#8217;s main concern was trying to stuff several wrapped gifts for aunts, grandparents and cousins into their two carry-ons.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely unfortunate because we&#8217;re going for a graduation and there&#8217;s lots of gifts for the graduation. I don&#8217;t know if we can fit them all,&#8221; Desjadon said.</p>\n<p>Desjadon said a lot of other passengers were more frustrated than he was.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard every swear word known to man in the last 15 minutes,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Nearly 4.3 million passengers travelled through Sky Harbor in March, making it the airport&#8217;s busiest month ever.</p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p>Associated Press writers Anna Johnson and Michelle A.

Facebook denies that report, which relied upon a single anonymous individual with self-described conservative leanings.</p>\n<p>In its own blog post , the company said a series of checks and balances \u2014 involving both software formulas and humans \u2014 ensures that stories displayed in the &#8220;trending topics&#8221; section aren&#8217;t biased. The post linked to a 28-page internal document Facebook uses to determine trending topics, after the Guardian published a similar document that was leaked to it.</p>\n<p>Justin Osofsky, vice-president of global operations, said the guidelines ensure that stories in trending topics represent &#8220;the most important popular stories, regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The guidelines do not permit reviewers to add or suppress political perspectives,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Facebook hasn&#8217;t said how many people are responsible for the trending topics team. A Guardian report on Thursday said the team was as few as 12 people, citing leaked documents, but Facebook didn&#8217;t comment on that number.</p>\n<p>Trending topics were introduced in 2014 and appear in a separate section to the right of the Facebook newsfeed. According to Facebook, potential trending topics are first determined by a software formula, or algorithm, that identifies topics that have spiked in popularity on the site.</p>\n<p>Next, a team of trending topic staffers review potential topics and confirm the topic is tied to a current news event; write a topic description with information corroborated by at least three of 1,000 news outlets ; apply a category label to the topic; and check to see whether the topic is covered by most or all of ten major media outlets (including The New York Times, Fox News, BuzzFeed and others). Stories covered by those outlets gain an importance level that may make them more likely to be seen.</p>\n<p>(Facebook&#8217;s list of 1,000 news outlets contains several popular conservative sites, including Fox, the Drudge Report, Glenn Beck&#8217;s site The Blaze, the Daily Caller and the Washington Times.)</p>\n<p>Each Facebook user&#8217;s trending topics are then personalized via an algorithm that relies on information about the user such as &#8220;Likes&#8221; and their location.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Online:</p>\n<p>Blog Post: http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/05/information-about-trending-topics/</p>\n<p>Guidelines: https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/full-trending-review-guidelines.pdf</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/facebook-delivers-the-scoop-on-how-it-delivers-the-news/\">Facebook delivers the scoop on how it delivers the news</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/facebook-delivers-the-scoop-on-how-it-delivers-the-news/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Latest: Don Blankenship reports to California prison</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/the-latest-don-blankenship-reports-to-california-prison/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/the-latest-don-blankenship-reports-to-california-prison/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:18:08 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/the-latest-don-blankenship-reports-to-california-prison/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. &#8211; The Latest on Ex-Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, who is scheduled to report to prison Thursday after being convicted of conspiring to wilfully violate mine safety standards&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/the-latest-don-blankenship-reports-to-california-prison/\">The Latest: Don Blankenship reports to California prison</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. &#8211; The Latest on Ex-Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, who is scheduled to report to prison Thursday after being convicted of conspiring to wilfully violate mine safety standards at West Virginia&#8217;s Upper Big Branch coal mine, which exploded in 2010, killing 29 men (all times local):</p>\n<p>6 p.m.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons says former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship has reported to a California prison to begin his one-year sentence.</p>\n<p>Spokesman Justin Long says Blankenship is in custody Thursday at a federal facility in Taft, California.</p>\n<p>According to the Bureau of Prisons&#8217; website, the facility is operated by a private corporation.</p>\n<p>Thursday was the deadline for Blankenship to report.

That&#8217;s up from fewer than 10 per cent of metro areas in 2000.</p>\n<p>That sharp shift reflects a broader erosion that occurred from 2000 through 2014. Over that time, the middle class shrank in nine of every 10 metro areas, Pew found.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Nissan pays bargain price for Mitsubishi stake, analysts say</p>\n<p>Nissan is spending 237 billion yen ($2.2 billion) for a controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors, as that company tries to recover from a scandal over fuel-economy ratings.</p>\n<p>Analysts say Nissan is making the move because the price is right and Mitsubishi has sales and technology in areas where Nissan has little.</p>\n<p>The deal, announced Thursday in Japan, comes as Mitsubishi&#8217;s stock value has fallen dramatically over revelations that the company cheated on Japanese fuel mileage tests.

The home&#8217;s website is filled with information about the impact of texting and driving.</p>\n<p>While all the provinces as well as Yukon and the Northwest Territories ban people from using handheld devices while driving, distracted driving may be a bigger problem than drunk driving in the country, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada.</p>\n<p>Distracted driving doesn&#8217;t just include texting. It can also refer to people who fiddle with the settings on a GPS or focus on a handheld device for many other reasons.</p>\n<p>People who take their eyes off the road for more than two seconds double their risk of getting in a collision, according to the Ontario Ministry of Transportation.</p>\n<p>In the United States, about eight people died and more than 1,100 others were injured on average daily in crashes that reportedly involved a distracted driver in 2013, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>In Ontario, 69 people died last year in accidents where driver distraction played a role, the Ontario Provincial Police said, outnumbering all other categories for the third year in a row.</p>\n<p>John St. said it decided to tackle this issue on its own. The ad agency teamed up with Cieslok Media, which provided the billboard space.</p>\n<p>The agency opted for the provocative angle to grab public attention and not get lost among the many ads people see every day, said Savoie.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you speak to people in a way they&#8217;re used to being spoken to \u2014 which is, &#8216;Don&#8217;t text and drive,&#8217; \u2014 they&#8217;ll just say, &#8216;OK. Yup. Duly noted. Let me check my phone,'&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>So far, the reaction to the ad has been positive, she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The balance between the provocative nature of the message and the informative nature of the message is proving to be, you know, quite successful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the first time a PSA on the perils of texting while driving has been tackled creatively.</p>\n<p>The Alberta government has run a &#8220;crotches kill&#8221; anti-texting-and-driving campaign for multiple years.</p>\n<p>The text-and-drive billboards in Toronto went up earlier this week and will remain on display until Sunday.</p>\n<p>Follow @AleksSagan on Twitter.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/text-and-drive-billboards-on-toronto-highway-deliver-grim-message/\">&#8216;Text and drive&#8217; billboards on Toronto highway deliver grim message</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/text-and-drive-billboards-on-toronto-highway-deliver-grim-message/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>House OKs bipartisan drug abuse bills, but Dems want money</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/house-oks-bipartisan-drug-abuse-bills-but-dems-want-money/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/house-oks-bipartisan-drug-abuse-bills-but-dems-want-money/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/house-oks-bipartisan-drug-abuse-bills-but-dems-want-money/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON &#8211; The House has approved a mountain of bills addressing the nation&#8217;s opioid abuse crisis, fueled by lawmakers&#8217; bipartisan craving for election-year action on the deadly epidemic.

Yet the measures are leaving anti-drug advocates underwhelmed, and Congress won&#8217;t decide till later how much money it&#8217;s willing to provide.</p>\n<p>By huge bipartisan margins, the House approved 18 drug-related bills this week setting up federal grants, new rules and studies of the problem, including three measures on Thursday. That harmony seemed worlds apart from the partisan disputes that have hindered recent congressional efforts to address the Zika virus, Puerto Rican debt and the poisoned water of Flint, Michigan.</p>\n<p>The legislation was aimed at combatting the growing toll from misuse of opioids \u2014 addictive pain-killing narcotics and heroin \u2014 which in 2014 killed nearly 29,000 people, triple the death rate of 2000.</p>\n<p>More than 2 million people were abusing prescription opioid painkillers and nearly 500,000 more were addicted to heroin in 2012, the government says, and both parties are eager to show voters they are addressing a problem that afflicts inner cities and rural communities alike. The bills&#8217; sponsors included some lawmakers facing competitive re-election races this fall, including GOP Reps. Frank Guinta of New Hampshire and Bob Dold of Illinois and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chief sponsor of similar Senate legislation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This problem is a problem for America. This problem has exploded,&#8221; Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., said during the week&#8217;s debate.</p>\n<p>Joined by the White House, Democrats were backing the bills but also complaining that little would be achieved without money. President Barack Obama has proposed an additional $1.1 billion to address the problem.</p>\n<p>The largest House bill, approved Thursday by 413-5, establishes grants worth $103 million annually over the next five years but provides none of the actual funds, leaving that for future spending legislation in which all federal programs will compete for funds. On Wednesday, Republicans rejected a Democratic effort to add $600 million in spending.</p>\n<p>Without money, the House bills &#8220;would do little to help the thousands of Americans struggling with addiction,&#8221; the White House wrote in a statement to lawmakers.</p>\n<p>Asked how much money will be available for the programs, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, R-Ky., whose panel oversees federal agencies&#8217; spending, said, &#8220;It will be adequate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The measures would create grants for programs bolstering law enforcement, monitoring prescriptions and training first responders to use anti-overdose drugs like naloxone. It would be easier for some health care providers to administer overdose reversal drugs, anti-drug programs helping pregnant women and new mothers would be renewed, and curbs would be eased against partially filling some prescriptions \u2014 a way of reducing unused opioids available to drug abusers.</p>\n<p>Advocates of drug abuse prevention and treatment programs said they were pleased Congress was addressing the problem but said they viewed the bills as only a start.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Feel free to use the word &#8216;inadequate,&#8217; but a step in the right direction,'&#8221; Marvin Ventrell, executive director of the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers, said of the resources the legislation would potentially provide.</p>\n<p>Ventrell said the bills were &#8220;major in terms of message&#8221; because they were the first indications in years that Congress was moving toward addressing the issue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very important start, but we need dollars, we need statutory changes and we need sustained focus and attention,&#8221; said Robert Morrison, executive director of the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors.</p>\n<p>Morrison said a federal program offering $1.9 billion yearly in grants to states for substance abuse prevention and treatment has $483 million less purchasing power than it did a decade ago, thanks to inflation losses. He said he wants lawmakers to offer more help for new mothers who are addicts and more medications to treat drug abusers.</p>\n<p>To the dismay of leading House Republicans, this week&#8217;s work on the bills was overshadowed by the GOP presidential campaign and the buildup to Thursday&#8217;s meeting between presumptive candidate Donald Trump and the party&#8217;s top elected official, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.</p>\n<p>Underscoring Republican efforts to draw attention to the legislation, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong issued a statement addressed to journalists on Tuesday saying, &#8220;While politics may have your attention right now, we hope you&#8217;ll have time to review and write on this important and thoughtful action the House is about to take to tackle the disturbing opioid epidemic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Senate used a 94-1 vote in March to approve its version of the legislation. GOP leaders hope the two chambers can send compromise legislation to Obama for his signature before Congress begins a lengthy summer recess in July.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/house-oks-bipartisan-drug-abuse-bills-but-dems-want-money/\">House OKs bipartisan drug abuse bills, but Dems want money</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/house-oks-bipartisan-drug-abuse-bills-but-dems-want-money/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Kohl&#8217;s and Apple slump, Monsanto and Jack in the Box climb</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/kohls-and-apple-slump-monsanto-and-jack-in-the-box-climb/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/kohls-and-apple-slump-monsanto-and-jack-in-the-box-climb/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 20:43:29 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/kohls-and-apple-slump-monsanto-and-jack-in-the-box-climb/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK, N.Y. &#8211;

Here is a list of backyard chicken regulations for some Canadian cities:</p>\n<p>\u2014 The City of Edmonton runs an urban hens pilot project and has issued 50 licences. Its Community Services Committee is studying potential issues and concerns associated with keeping urban hens and will report back to the city next year.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Vancouver allows a maximum of four hens per lot, but no roosters are permitted. Residents are not allowed to slaughter the chickens in the backyard.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Whitehorse residents can have six hens on their urban property as long as they apply for a permit, have the hens for personal use only and don&#8217;t sell the eggs, manure, meat or other chicken products.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Victoria has no backyard chicken limits, but the numbers of chickens must be consistent with the residents&#8217; personal egg use. No roosters are allowed. Tips on the city&#8217;s website include building a decent coop: &#8220;Don&#8217;t build a chicken coop out of three sheets of plywood and a hockey net unless you want to meet an Animal Control Officer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\u2014 Calgary, Winnipeg and Toronto do not allow backyard chickens, although bylaw officers in Toronto will only investigate if neighbours complain.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Halifax has endured numerous backyard chicken debates, but so far the city does not permit chickens.</p>\n<p>\u2014 In Montreal, some boroughs allow chickens, including in Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve where chickens are allowed in pens in eight community gardens.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/a-list-of-where-some-canadian-cities-stand-on-backyard-chickens/\">A list of where some Canadian cities stand on backyard chickens</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/a-list-of-where-some-canadian-cities-stand-on-backyard-chickens/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Chicken rentals offer test runs for would-be backyard farmers wanting eggs</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/chicken-rentals-offer-test-runs-for-would-be-backyard-farmers-wanting-eggs/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/chicken-rentals-offer-test-runs-for-would-be-backyard-farmers-wanting-eggs/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:44:34 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/chicken-rentals-offer-test-runs-for-would-be-backyard-farmers-wanting-eggs/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>SAANICH, B.C. &#8211; Kate Fraser holds a big brown hen she calls Dr. Donna in her arms while her two-year-old son Coby tugs on the bird&#8217;s leathery feet.<br />\nFraser, 34,&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/chicken-rentals-offer-test-runs-for-would-be-backyard-farmers-wanting-eggs/\">Chicken rentals offer test runs for would-be backyard farmers wanting eggs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SAANICH, B.C. &#8211; Kate Fraser holds a big brown hen she calls Dr. Donna in her arms while her two-year-old son Coby tugs on the bird&#8217;s leathery feet.</p>\n<p>Fraser, 34, says she always wanted to be a farm girl, and this month she helped other would-be farmers with similar dreams of eating yard-to-table fresh eggs by renting out several dozen chickens.</p>\n<p>Fraser is one of two Rent The Chicken operators in British Columbia and among eight across Canada.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Renting is the way to try it out without committing to buying and building your own coop and raising your own chicks, and finding out they are actually roosters instead of hens,&#8221; said Fraser. who lives in Saanich, a suburb of Victoria. &#8220;It&#8217;s a way for you and your family to try out chickens. They are fun to have around.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rent The Chicken comes with two or four egg-laying hens, a mobile coop, food and water dishes, and a food supply, including dried meal worms, which chickens apparently love.</p>\n<p>The rental fee ranges from $425 for two hens and $600 for four hens for six months, from May to October.</p>\n<p>Renters have the option of adopting their hens at the end the six-month period for a fee of $250 for two hens or $350 for four hens. The coop is included.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already booked all my rentals for 2016,&#8221; said Fraser. &#8220;There&#8217;s a wait list. We sold out by February and people just started getting their orders.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lucy Hewlett said she&#8217;s happy with her rental chickens so far but she has yet to decide on adoption.</p>\n<p>The avid vegetable gardener in Colwood, near Victoria, said she viewed the rental as an opportunity to test raising farm animals.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It seemed affordable and practical,&#8221; Hewlett said. &#8220;I&#8217;d always wanted fresh eggs and having an organic option. So, it fit in in many ways.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said her two hens started producing eggs within the first week.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had half a dozen in less than a week,&#8221; said Hewlett. &#8220;They&#8217;re delicious. I had a really nice egg this morning for breakfast.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rent The Chicken co-founder Jenn Tompkins said the rental business started in 2013 in Freeport, Pa. There are 31 locations in the United States.</p>\n<p>Rent The Chicken started in Canada last year in Moffat, Ont., near Toronto. There are two other Ontario locations and one each in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward  Island. The other B.C. location is in Kamloops.</p>\n<p>Tompkins said many people want their food source close to their homes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We provide an opportunity for families to try out having backyard hens for fresh eggs without the long-term commitment,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We like to say if they chicken out, we pick up the chickens, the coop, their supplies with no questions asked.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fraser said her chicken rentals have become a labour of love. She learned to build the coops in the family garage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I decided I wanted to do it myself rather than have someone build it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the learning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fraser puts Dr. Donna on the front lawn and the hen immediately begins pecking for food.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a large pet factor for chickens, too,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They&#8217;re great entertainment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/chicken-rentals-offer-test-runs-for-would-be-backyard-farmers-wanting-eggs/\">Chicken rentals offer test runs for would-be backyard farmers wanting eggs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/chicken-rentals-offer-test-runs-for-would-be-backyard-farmers-wanting-eggs/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Canadian Tire goes back to the future with innovative new print catalogue</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/canadian-tire-goes-back-to-the-future-with-innovative-new-print-catalogue/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/canadian-tire-goes-back-to-the-future-with-innovative-new-print-catalogue/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:39:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/canadian-tire-goes-back-to-the-future-with-innovative-new-print-catalogue/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>TORONTO &#8211; A print catalogue with the bells and whistles of a website is the type of innovation Canadian Tire Corp. hopes will help propel it into the future, the&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/canadian-tire-goes-back-to-the-future-with-innovative-new-print-catalogue/\">Canadian Tire goes back to the future with innovative new print catalogue</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TORONTO &#8211; A print catalogue with the bells and whistles of a website is the type of innovation Canadian Tire Corp. hopes will help propel it into the future, the head of the national retailer says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is the best example of bridging the old world and the new world,&#8221; chief executive Michael Medline said Thursday following release of the company&#8217;s latest financial results.</p>\n<p>The mammoth 200-page paper catalogue \u2014 Canadian Tire&#8217;s first in nearly a decade \u2014 was mailed to 12 million homes last month.</p>\n<p>Although some may question the retailer&#8217;s decision to go back to print after all these years, Medline said the interactive capabilities contained in the catalogue are nothing short of state-of-the-art.</p>\n<p>To access the additional content, customers need to download Canadian Tire&#8217;s mobile app, and then use their cellphone camera to hover over the catalogue pages for additional content like videos or to check if an item is in stock.</p>\n<p>Following the mailout, the company saw its weekly e-commerce transactions double, Medline said in describing the catalogue as &#8220;the single biggest impact lever we have ever pulled to generate more online sales.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These types of technological risks are what will set Canadian Tire (TSX:CTC.A) apart from its competitors, added Medline, who says he doesn&#8217;t feel threatened by the impending merger of home renovation rivals Rona and Lowe&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>Quebec-based Rona (TSX:RON) is slated to become a subsidiary of Lowe&#8217;s (NYSE:LOW) following a $3.2-billion takeover deal announced last February. The transaction is expected to close at the end of the month following regulatory approvals.</p>\n<p>Canadian Tire, which also owns athletic retailer Sport Chek and clothier Mark&#8217;s, has invested &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; of dollars in innovation over the past few years, but Medline says the company still believes in bricks-and-mortar stores that are exciting for the customer.</p>\n<p>That includes everything from renovating existing stores to be more interactive to incorporating virtual reality for customers to test out how tires feel in different driving conditions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We cannot rest on our laurels or be complacent,&#8221; he warned at the company&#8217;s annual general meeting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have seen what happens to many retailers in Canada who have taken for granted their market position and then fallen by the wayside. In an age of unprecedented disruption, innovation must be central to everything we do. Digital disruption is happening on a scale larger than any of us could&#8217;ve imagined.

The Fed&#8217;s leadership &#8220;remains overwhelmingly and disproportionately white and male,&#8221; they wrote.</p>\n<p>In its search for directors who oversee the Fed&#8217;s 12 regional banks for terms next year, the Fed&#8217;s board of governors should cast a wider net for African American, Latino and female candidates, as well as qualified people from labour, consumer and community organizations, the lawmakers told Yellen.</p>\n<p>A Fed spokesman, David Skidmore, responded that the central bank is &#8220;committed to fostering diversity \u2014 by race, ethnicity, gender and professional background \u2014 within its leadership ranks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have focused considerable attention in recent years on recruiting directors with diverse backgrounds and experiences,&#8221; Skidmore said. &#8220;By law, we consider the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labour and consumers. We also are aiming to increase ethnic and gender diversity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The senators signing the letter include Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is challenging front-runner Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. Warren and Sanders are the most outspoken Democratic critics on economic and financial issues.</p>\n<p>The 116 House members, representing more than half the 188 Democrats in the House, are led by Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.</p>\n<p>The letter cites data from the Center for Popular Democracy, a liberal advocacy group. The data indicates that 83 per cent of the directors who supervise the Fed&#8217;s regional banks are white and that nearly three-quarters of them are men. All the members of the Fed&#8217;s committee that sets interest-rate policy are white, and 60 per cent are men.</p>\n<p>The Fed counters that the proportion of minority directors on the boards of its regional banks and their branches has risen from 16 per cent in 2010 to 24 per cent this year, and that the proportion of female directors has increased from 23 per cent to 30 per cent. Forty-six per cent of the directors represent diversity in race and-or gender, the Fed said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are striving to continue that progress,&#8221; Skidmore said.</p>\n<p>The data cited in the congressional letter do not include directors of the regional banks&#8217; branches, only the banks themselves.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Clinton&#8217;s campaign said she shares the lawmakers&#8217; concerns. A spokesman, Jesse Ferguson, said Clinton thinks &#8220;the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole.&#8221; She also believes there no longer should be three private-sector bankers sitting on each regional Fed bank board, Ferguson said.</p>\n<p>That change would require new legislation.</p>\n<p>Yellen, the first woman to lead the central bank in its 100-plus-year history, has stressed in her public statements the importance of overcoming economic inequality.</p>\n<p>The five current Fed governors are white. Two, including Yellen, are women.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/group-of-lawmakers-says-fed-fails-to-diversify-leadership/\">Group of lawmakers says Fed fails to diversify leadership</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/group-of-lawmakers-says-fed-fails-to-diversify-leadership/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>RushCard to pay $19 million to users for last year&#8217;s outage</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/rushcard-to-pay-19-million-to-users-for-last-years-outage/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/rushcard-to-pay-19-million-to-users-for-last-years-outage/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:48:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/rushcard-to-pay-19-million-to-users-for-last-years-outage/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK, N.Y. &#8211; RushCard, the prepaid debit card company owned by hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, agreed to pay at least $19 million to compensate its users who were impacted&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/rushcard-to-pay-19-million-to-users-for-last-years-outage/\">RushCard to pay $19 million to users for last year&#8217;s outage</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK, N.Y. &#8211; RushCard, the prepaid debit card company owned by hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, agreed to pay at least $19 million to compensate its users who were impacted by the company&#8217;s multi-day outage last year.</p>\n<p>The technical fiasco caused tens of thousands of RushCard customers, who are largely poor and minorities, to be unable to access their money for as long as two weeks. Complaints from the outage clogged up the company&#8217;s customer service lines for days.</p>\n<p>According to the agreement filed in a New York court as part of a class-action lawsuit, RushCard will pay at least $100 to each user who could not access their funds. That amount can increase to up to $500 if the customer can document any losses they might have experienced due to the outage.</p>\n<p>Including earlier fee reimbursements the company has made, RushCard will have paid out more than $19 million, a company spokesman said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are pleased to have reached this preliminary settlement which will resolve the claims of our cardholders,&#8221; Rick Savard, CEO of Unirush, the parent company of RushCard, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>RushCard&#8217;s problems started in mid-October, when the company switched payment processors. The transition was botched, and resulting problems caused thousands of RushCard accounts to be frozen.</p>\n<p>Many RushCard customers are low-income minority Americans who don&#8217;t have traditional bank accounts. Without access to their money stored on their RushCards, some customers told The Associated Press at the time they could not buy food for their children, pay bills, or pay for gas to get to their jobs.</p>\n<p>The outage became a large issue on social media, where RushCard users flooded the Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts of Russell Simmons to complain about their inability to access their money.</p>\n<p>Simmons repeatedly apologized for the problems, often personally responding on social media.</p>\n<p>The issue became so large that it caught the attention of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal watchdog agency for the financial industry, which started an investigation into the company.</p>\n<p>The settlement was reported earlier by the legal news outlet Law360.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/rushcard-to-pay-19-million-to-users-for-last-years-outage/\">RushCard to pay $19 million to users for last year&#8217;s outage</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/rushcard-to-pay-19-million-to-users-for-last-years-outage/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>UN paints bleak picture of stagnating world economy</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/un-paints-bleak-picture-of-stagnating-world-economy/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/un-paints-bleak-picture-of-stagnating-world-economy/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:47:45 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/un-paints-bleak-picture-of-stagnating-world-economy/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations lowered its forecast for the world economy on Thursday, painting a bleak picture of stagnating growth with little prospect for a turnaround this year.<br />\nThe U.N. report&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/un-paints-bleak-picture-of-stagnating-world-economy/\">UN paints bleak picture of stagnating world economy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations lowered its forecast for the world economy on Thursday, painting a bleak picture of stagnating growth with little prospect for a turnaround this year.</p>\n<p>The U.N. report on the World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2016 forecasts overall global growth of just 2.4 per cent this year, the same as last year. It represents a significant drop from the 2.9 per cent growth the U.N. forecast for this year in its report last December.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The bleak state of the world economy clearly poses significant challenges for member states around the world,&#8221; Assistant Secretary-General Lenni Montiel told a news conference launching the report.</p>\n<p>He said forecasts for many countries in Africa and Latin America as well as for Russia and many of the former Soviet republics have been revised downward over the past few months.</p>\n<p>The report blames a host of factors for this year&#8217;s lacklustre economic prospects including persistent weak demand in the major economies which remains a drag on global growth, the low price of oil and other commodities which are hurting exporting countries, severe weather-related shocks especially severe drought related to El Nino, political challenges, and large capital outflows in many developing regions.</p>\n<p>Dawn Holland, a senior economist in the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs, said the 2.4 per cent growth predicted for this year is 1 per cent lower than the average annual rate of growth of 3.4 per cent in the decade leading up to the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. It reflects the weak global economy for most of the last decade, she said.</p>\n<p>For 2017, Monteil said, &#8220;the global economy is projected to expand by 2.8 per cent, marking a very modest improvement \u2014 and possibly reflecting the downturn bottoming out in some emerging economies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But he stressed that for the world economy to grow it needs increased investment and greater fiscal stimulus co-ordinated by the major economies who have relied for too long only on monetary stimulus like interest rates.</p>\n<p>Holland said so far there are no proposals for co-ordinated fiscal stimulus measures, but the issue will be discussed at the upcoming summit of the Group of Seven major industrial powers in Japan on May 26-27.</p>\n<p>The report highlights the prolonged economic downturns in Brazil and Russia, both with significant regional spillovers.</p>\n<p>In Russia, GDP is forecast to contract by 1.9 per cent in 2016 due to fiscal tightening, further declines in private consumption and investment, and continuing international sanctions, it said.</p>\n<p>In Brazil, where President Dilma Rousseff in facing impeachment, the U.N. is projecting that the economy will contract by 3.4 per cent this year, reflecting the deepening political crisis, rising inflation, a surging fiscal deficit and high interest rates.</p>\n<p>The world&#8217;s poorest countries are expected to grow by 4.8 per cent in 2016 and 5.5 per cent in 2017 but the report stressed that these figures are far below the U.N. target of at least 7.7 per cent growth needed to increase spending on health care, education and measures to combat climate change.</p>\n<p>The rich developed countries are not expected to see an improvement in GDP over last year, and in the United States the U.N. is predicting a drop in growth from 2.4 per cent in 2015 to 2.2 per cent this year due to weak business investment and low exports. Next year, the U.S. economy is forecast to rise slightly to 2.5 per cent.</p>\n<p>The report said &#8220;economic growth in Africa continues to lose momentum, as it is buffeted by global, regional and internal headwinds.&#8221; GDP growth for the continent slowed to 3 per cent last year and is expected to weaken more this year to 2.8 per cent though east Africa is expected to see 6.1 per cent growth.</p>\n<p>Latin America and the Caribbean are expected to see the region&#8217;s economies contract by 0.6 per cent for the second straight year, according to the report.</p>\n<p>Holland said this would be the first two-year contraction since the debt crisis of 1982-83. She cited high inflation, high interest rates, rising unemployment, rising fiscal deficits &#8220;and a loss in confidence which is holding back investment&#8221; in some South American countries.</p>\n<p>On a positive note, east Asia is projected to see 5.5 per cent economic growth this year, with China&#8217;s economy forecast to grow by 6.4 per cent in 2016 and 6.5 per cent in 2017, in line with government targets, the report said.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/un-paints-bleak-picture-of-stagnating-world-economy/\">UN paints bleak picture of stagnating world economy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/un-paints-bleak-picture-of-stagnating-world-economy/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Alberta to have plan within 2 weeks for returning evacuees</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/alberta-to-have-plan-within-2-weeks-for-returning-evacuees/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/alberta-to-have-plan-within-2-weeks-for-returning-evacuees/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:32:18 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/alberta-to-have-plan-within-2-weeks-for-returning-evacuees/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>EDMONTON &#8211; Alberta will have a plan within two weeks for getting residents of the wildfire-ravaged oil sands capital Fort McMurray back into their homes, the province&#8217;s municipal affairs minister&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/alberta-to-have-plan-within-2-weeks-for-returning-evacuees/\">Alberta to have plan within 2 weeks for returning evacuees</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>EDMONTON &#8211; Alberta will have a plan within two weeks for getting residents of the wildfire-ravaged oil sands capital Fort McMurray back into their homes, the province&#8217;s municipal affairs minister said Thursday.</p>\n<p>Danielle Larivee told reporters that she realizes how stressful it is for evacuees \u2014 thousands of them in the Edmonton area \u2014 but that their safety is the most important thing.

A copy of the deposition of James Allen, CEO for Seminole Gaming, has been turned over to Politico by the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation through a public records request.</p>\n<p>The state of the Florida and the tribe are locked in a dispute over whether the Seminoles casinos can continue to have blackjack tables at their casinos including ones located in Tampa and Hollywood in South Florida. The tribe filed the lawsuit last year after portions of a five-year gambling deal with the state expired.</p>\n<p>The Associated Press has requested a copy of the deposition that was released to Politico.</p>\n<p>The motion asks the judge to block any further release of information from the deposition until the tribe can decide whether the material contains trade secrets. It contends that attorneys representing the state agreed to keep material confidential ahead of the trial that is now scheduled for October.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Allowing third-parties to receive pretrial discovery materials prior to the tribe&#8217;s review and redaction of trade secret or confidential information will do nothing to advance the litigation, and would likely cause the tribe annoyance, embarrassment, and oppression,&#8221; the motion states.</p>\n<p>It also states: &#8220;Politico refused to comply with requests by both the tribe and the state of Florida to return the transcript and to permit the tribe to replace it with a version that is redacted and is actively threatening to publish the contents thereof.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Politico published a story Thursday that said the information that the tribe wants redacted is revenue information about the casinos.</p>\n<p>Gov. Rick Scott in December reached a new $3 billion deal with the tribe that would let them keep blackjack and add table games, such as craps and roulette. The deal also allows for the addition of slot machines at a Palm Beach county dog track and also leaves an opening for another casino in Miami-Dade as well as create a path for existing tracks in that county and Broward to eventually add blackjack tables as well.</p>\n<p>But the deal was rejected by the Florida Legislature during this year&#8217;s session that wrapped up in March as various interests \u2014 including the owners of existing tracks that compete against the Seminoles \u2014 pushed for changes that were not part of the initial deal approved by tribal officials.</p>\n<p>The setback means that it could be the courts that ultimately decide what type of gambling will be allowed to continue in the state.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/tribe-wants-to-stop-publication-of-gambling-trial-deposition/\">Tribe wants to stop publication of gambling-trial deposition</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/tribe-wants-to-stop-publication-of-gambling-trial-deposition/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Key scallop fishing area in Maine to be closed for 9 months</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/key-scallop-fishing-area-in-maine-to-be-closed-for-9-months/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/key-scallop-fishing-area-in-maine-to-be-closed-for-9-months/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:56:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/key-scallop-fishing-area-in-maine-to-be-closed-for-9-months/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>PORTLAND, Maine &#8211; Federal regulators are shutting down scallop fishing in the northern Gulf of Maine, which is one of the most important harvesting areas for the shellfish.<br />\nOfficials with&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/key-scallop-fishing-area-in-maine-to-be-closed-for-9-months/\">Key scallop fishing area in Maine to be closed for 9 months</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PORTLAND, Maine &#8211; Federal regulators are shutting down scallop fishing in the northern Gulf of Maine, which is one of the most important harvesting areas for the shellfish.</p>\n<p>Officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday that fishermen have reached their quota for the area and it will be closed starting Friday. The closure of the area to federally permitted scallop boats will last until next Feb. 28.</p>\n<p>The closure is the first of its kind since the current quota system was implemented in 2008, New England Fishery Management Council analyst Deirdre Boelke said. She said it&#8217;s unlikely to have a dramatic impact on the availability or price of scallops nationally.</p>\n<p>Scallop fishing in the northern Gulf of Maine has caused tension this year as fishing boats have moved into the waters off the northern Massachusetts coast to seek the shellfish.

When he regained consciousness, Hewett was on a pile of rocks, unable to move. First responders eventually found him and transported him to a Philadelphia hospital, where he would spend the next seven weeks in a medically-induced coma.</p>\n<p>On the anniversary of the derailment, Hewett said Thursday that the past year of his life \u2014 an endless series of doctors&#8217; appointments, physical therapy and nightmares \u2014 has been &#8220;terrible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have pain 24/7,&#8221; he told reporters at a press conference through laboured breaths, explaining that his rib cage has not fully healed and that his lungs cannot fully expand. &#8220;The two outcomes for me were paralyzed for life, or death.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 58-year-old BASF regional security officer spent another seven weeks in a rehabilitation centre. He was among more than 200 people injured in the crash, which also killed eight people. The New York-bound Northeast Regional train entered a sharp curve at 106 mph \u2014 more than twice the speed limit \u2014 before careening off the tracks.</p>\n<p>Next week, federal investigators are scheduled to meet to detail the probable cause of the derailment in Philadelphia. They&#8217;ve said the evidence showed no issues with the tracks, signals or the locomotive and they didn&#8217;t find any signs that the train had been stuck by a rock or that the engineer was using his cellphone.</p>\n<p>The railroad has apologized for the crash and an emotional Amtrak CEO Joseph Boardman told Congress afterward that Amtrak was responsible. The train&#8217;s engineer has said he couldn&#8217;t explain why the train kept accelerating after he applied the brake.</p>\n<p>Hewett said he plans to watch the hearing on television from his home in New Jersey. He said no one from Amtrak, including the train&#8217;s engineer, has apologized or contacted him since the crash.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This was something that never had to happen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;His actions could have been easily prevented.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hewett said he won&#8217;t take the train anymore. Joined by his wife and daughter Thursday, he said he is hoping to reunite with the first responders who rescued him at a private ceremony in Philadelphia to mark the anniversary.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/passengers-life-still-derailed-1-year-after-deadly-crash/\">Passenger&#8217;s life &#8216;still derailed&#8217; 1 year after deadly crash</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/passengers-life-still-derailed-1-year-after-deadly-crash/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Maritime cities struggle with panhandlers ahead of summer tourist season</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/maritime-cities-struggle-with-panhandlers-ahead-of-summer-tourist-season/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/maritime-cities-struggle-with-panhandlers-ahead-of-summer-tourist-season/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:50:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/maritime-cities-struggle-with-panhandlers-ahead-of-summer-tourist-season/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>HALIFAX &#8211; As several Maritime cities consider measures to fight aggressive panhandling ahead of the summer tourist season, police and social experts warn it is symptomatic of a larger societal&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/maritime-cities-struggle-with-panhandlers-ahead-of-summer-tourist-season/\">Maritime cities struggle with panhandlers ahead of summer tourist season</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HALIFAX &#8211; As several Maritime cities consider measures to fight aggressive panhandling ahead of the summer tourist season, police and social experts warn it is symptomatic of a larger societal problem that can&#8217;t be solved through enforcement alone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a challenging problem for law enforcement because panhandling is not an illegal act,&#8221; said Insp. Lindsay Hernden, a divisional commander with Halifax Regional Police.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Charlottetown council moved to amend its nuisance bylaw to prevent panhandlers from blocking pedestrians from freely walking by them and also to prevent them from soliciting &#8220;captive audiences&#8221; at places such as banking machines and bus stops or in vehicles stopped on a roadway.</p>\n<p>Charlottetown deputy police chief Gary McGuigan said while the majority of his city&#8217;s panhandling is considered passive in nature, the numbers of people soliciting for money in the downtown area has increased and the move is meant to keep the activity under control.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some people may be intimidated by it, some may not,&#8221; said McGuigan. &#8220;But there were concerns from businesses about the amount of panhandlers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Halifax has seen a growing number of complaints recently from local business associations about aggressive panhandlers who follow and badger people for money.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s something police are examining, Hernden said, although he added officers have rarely encountered what&#8217;s been described as aggressive panhandling. He said when an incident does occur it usually involves a person who has some sort of mental health issue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of the information that we are getting along these lines is anecdotal,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We do not see a significant amount of reporting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jeff Karabanow, a professor with Dalhousie University&#8217;s School of Social Work, said it&#8217;s possible some of the growing numbers of people who end up on our streets are more aggressive, but it&#8217;s not something he&#8217;s experienced in downtown Halifax.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not to say that it doesn&#8217;t happen here and there,&#8221; said Karabanow.</p>\n<p>He said he understands why businesses in particular would want to complain about panhandlers frequenting their storefronts when they are trying to attract consumers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the bigger question is we have some very deep core issues around poverty that are not being addressed and we are going to see more and more people in informal economies and engaging in street survival,&#8221; Karabanow said.</p>\n<p>This week&#8217;s move by P.E.I.&#8217;s capital city is the latest in a series of measures taken by communities across the continent.</p>\n<p>Last month, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a bill to restrict the movements of &#8220;pushy&#8221; panhandlers in Times Square in order to prevent them from blocking pedestrians in traffic-free parts of the square.</p>\n<p>The legislation was in response to long-standing complaints about panhandlers harassing tourists for tips or to pay for such things as photos.</p>\n<p>McGuigan said Charlottetown businesses have also installed so-called &#8220;kindness meters&#8221; in an attempt to get people to donate to soup kitchens, the local food bank and the Salvation Army.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a move that&#8217;s been tried in other communities in an attempt to cut down on panhandling, including Fredericton, where six used parking meters were converted to support aid groups.</p>\n<p>In Halifax, Hernden said police have asked city legal staff to review the current bylaw, although he added police aren&#8217;t pushing for any changes at this point.</p>\n<p>He said police have a close relationship with many of the panhandlers in the downtown area and know they are on the streets for a variety of reasons \u2014 from mental health and addiction problems to homelessness and the need to supplement their incomes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are not going to solve this issue through enforcement,&#8221;

In a setback for the Obama health care law, a federal judge ruled Thursday that the administration is unconstitutionally subsidizing medical bills for millions of people while ignoring congressional power over government spending.</p>\n<p>The ruling from U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer was a win for House Republicans who brought the politically charged legal challenge in an effort to undermine the law.</p>\n<p>If the decision is upheld, it could roil the health care law&#8217;s insurance markets, which are still struggling for stability after three years.</p>\n<p>Collyer said her ruling would be put on hold while it is appealed. The White House expressed confidence it would be overturned.</p>\n<p>At issue is the $175 billion the government is paying to reimburse health insurers over a decade to reduce deductibles and co-payments for lower-income people.</p>\n<p>The House argues that Congress never specifically appropriated that money and has denied an administration request for it. Collyer agreed that the administration is exceeding its constitutional authority by spending the money anyway. She rejected the administration&#8217;s argument that the law authorizes the money automatically because the program is considered an &#8220;entitlement&#8221; like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.</p>\n<p>House Republicans launched the lawsuit in 2014 over Democrats&#8217; objections. The GOP-led House had already voted dozens of times to repeal all or parts of &#8220;Obamacare,&#8221; but those efforts went nowhere, failing to overcome opposition from Senate Democrats and the president.</p>\n<p>So the House turned its focus to tying up money spent on the law. Republican House leaders asserted that the Obama administration couldn&#8217;t spend money that lawmakers refused to provide.</p>\n<p>House Speaker Paul Ryan called the decision &#8220;an historic win for the Constitution and the American people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The court ruled that the administration overreached by spending taxpayer money without approval from the people&#8217;s representatives,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>\n<p>White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that House Republicans ultimately would lose the case.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This suit represents the first time in our nation&#8217;s history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute,&#8221; Earnest said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to refight a political fight that they keep losing,&#8221; Earnest added. &#8220;They have been losing this fight for six years. And they&#8217;ll lose it again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The administration is expected to appeal Thursday&#8217;s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where a majority of active judges have been appointed by Democrats.</p>\n<p>Collyer was appointed to the district court by President George W. Bush, a Republican.</p>\n<p>About 12.7 million people are covered through insurance markets created by President Barack Obama&#8217;s law. The disputed subsidies help lower-earning customers afford out-of-pocket costs, such as annual insurance deductibles and co-payments when they seek medical care.</p>\n<p>These subsidies, called &#8220;cost-sharing reductions&#8221; are separate from the financial aid provided under the law to help people pay their monthly premiums, which would not be affected.</p>\n<p>But that doesn&#8217;t make the cost-sharing subsidies any less important. Without them, millions of people may not be able to afford to use their health insurance.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why: The most popular policies are skinny plans with low monthly premiums but high deductibles and copayments. The average annual deductible for a silver plan \u2014 the kind picked by about 7 in 10 customers \u2014 is nearly $2,900, according to the consulting firm Avalere Health.</p>\n<p>Under the law, insurers have to provide cost-sharing assistance to consumers picking a silver plan who make up to two-and-a-half times the federal poverty level, which is $60,750 for a family of four.</p>\n<p>The government is then required to reimburse insurers for the cost of the subsidies. The administration maintains that&#8217;s automatically authorized, and it doesn&#8217;t have to go back to Congress for approval each year.</p>\n<p>But Collyer rejected that argument, saying appropriating the money is up to lawmakers. &#8220;That is Congress&#8217; prerogative,&#8221; Collyer wrote. &#8220;The court cannot override it by rewriting&#8221; the law.</p>\n<p>If congressional approval is required, Congress&#8217; GOP majority can just shut off the spending. And if that happens, the administration says the only option insurers have would be to raise premiums significantly.</p>\n<p>However, more insurers might just decide to bail out of the health law markets. Major companies already are struggling to make money on the program.</p>\n<p>The White House had earlier argued that the House had no legal authority to pursue its lawsuit, but Collyer rejected that argument and allowed it to proceed.</p>\n<p>In another case last year, the Supreme Court threw out a challenge to the law&#8217;s subsidies for premiums. The legal issues in that case were much different.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/judge-sides-with-house-republicans-against-health-care-law/\">Judge sides with House Republicans against health care law</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/judge-sides-with-house-republicans-against-health-care-law/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Germany: No new EU deal for Britain if it leaves the bloc</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/germany-no-new-eu-deal-for-britain-if-it-leaves-the-bloc/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/germany-no-new-eu-deal-for-britain-if-it-leaves-the-bloc/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:21:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/germany-no-new-eu-deal-for-britain-if-it-leaves-the-bloc/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>FRANKFURT &#8211; German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Thursday that Britain will not get an improved membership deal with the European Union if the country votes to leave the bloc.&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-news/germany-no-new-eu-deal-for-britain-if-it-leaves-the-bloc/\">Germany: No new EU deal for Britain if it leaves the bloc</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com\">Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FRANKFURT &#8211; German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Thursday that Britain will not get an improved membership deal with the European Union if the country votes to leave the bloc.</p>\n<p>Schaeuble said in a speech he wanted to end any speculation that a &#8220;leave&#8221; vote in the June 23 referendum could be used to improve on a deal won by Prime Minister David Cameron to change Britain&#8217;s membership terms.</p>\n<p>Schaeuble said that &#8220;this is the only deal on the table.
