No gentleness. No delicacy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_705841\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\" wp-image-705841\" src=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/lfp20160512cg355.jpg?w=320&#038;h=421\" alt=\"London Lightning player Tyshawn Patterson flips in the air as he and Windsor Express player Brandon Robinson fight for possession of the ball during game 1 of their NBL Canada basketball playoff series at Budweiser Gardens in London, Ont. on Thursday May 12, 2016.\" width=\"320\" height=\"421\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">London Lightning player Tyshawn Patterson flips in the air as he and Windsor Express player Brandon Robinson fight for possession of the ball during game 1 of their NBL Canada basketball playoff series at Budweiser Gardens in London, Ont. on Thursday May 12, 2016.</p></div>\n<p>The Express ripped home-court advantage away from the London Lightning, defeating them 100-98 Thursday in National Basketball League of Canada play.</p>\n<p>The win gave the Express a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Division final.</p>\n<p>But if that\u2019s what the rest of the series is going to be like, get your tickets now.</p>\n<p>The Lightning almost clawed back a 17-point deficit, including a 10-point deficit with a minute left. They could have won it at the buzzer but a long, long, long three-pointer by Tyshawn Patterson went off the backboard and the front of the rim.</p>\n<p>After the game, the teams headed to the dressing room without shaking hands. Yes, it was that nasty.</p>\n<p>The Express ran the Lightning out of the building in the third quarter. They trailed by one in that quarter, then went on a 16-0 run to take control of the game.</p>\n<p>They outscored the Lightning 30-17, taking advantage of the Lightning\u2019s cold shooting and their aversion to defence.</p>\n<p>Give the Express credit \u2014 they were the far better team in the second half. They wanted the ball more and shared it. That movement gave them a lot of easy shots.</p>\n<p>The Lightning\u2019s second half was a disaster. They didn\u2019t show any energy and decided to play one-on-one basketball. They took too many selfish shots. They managed to wake up when they fell behind by 17 and cut it to six but the Express responded whenever the Lightning made a run.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_705844\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-705844\" src=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/lfp20160512cg357.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"Windsor Express player Maurice Bolden and London Lightning player Akeem Wright chase after a loose ball during game 1 of their NBL Canada basketball playoff series at Budweiser Gardens in London, Ont. on Thursday May 12, 2016.\"  ><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Windsor Express player Maurice Bolden and London Lightning player Akeem Wright chase after a loose ball during game 1 of their NBL Canada basketball playoff series at Budweiser Gardens in London, Ont. on Thursday May 12, 2016.</p></div>\n<p>What drove the knife a little deeper was that it was two former Lightning players who came up big. When the Lightning cut it to eight and then six, it was Tony Bennett who hit a pair of killer threes.</p>\n<p>But it was Maurice Bolden who gave the Express big points when Brandon Robinson didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>The Express were led by Robinson with 32 points while Bolden had 22</p>\n<p>Akeem Wright had 18 for the Lightning and 16 rebounds while Garrett Williamson had 17.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the second time the Lightning and Express have met in the playoffs. The first time was in the 2013-14 season when the Express eliminated the Lightning in the Central Division final in seven games.</p>\n<p>The two met 10 times this year with the teams splitting the series.</p>\n<p>The teams have also split four NBL championships between them in what has to be considered as the most heated rivalry in the league.</p>\n<p>Both teams came into Game 1 playing well despite a season of inconsistency. But playoffs are a time when veterans find their comfort zone and both teams have veterans who have been through the basketball battles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_705845\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\" wp-image-705845\" src=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/lfp20160512cg360.jpg?w=320&#038;h=451\" alt=\"London Lightning player Garrett Williamson is fouled by Windsor Express player Chris Commons during game 1 of their NBL Canada basketball playoff series at Budweiser Gardens in London, Ont. on Thursday May 12, 2016.\" width=\"320\" height=\"451\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">London Lightning player Garrett Williamson is fouled by Windsor Express player Chris Commons during game 1 of their NBL Canada basketball playoff series at Budweiser Gardens in London, Ont. on Thursday May 12, 2016.</p></div>\n<p>It comes down to who can respond to the pressure and playoff atmosphere and Express coach Bill Jones believes the pressure is all on the Lightning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been always the one that\u2019s had to defend, now it\u2019s London that has to defend,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey are the top team. Now we are pursuing them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any pressure at all. The last two years we\u2019ve had the best record overall and we were expected to win. Now we are the second-place team in our division and we can go out and pursue a championship and not worry about defending.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both teams played some of their best basketball in the first round of the playoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessional basketball and professional sports in general, you have to be peaking at the right time and right now that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIn the last series, we played well against Niagara.\u201d</p>\n<p>Championship teams have the ability to bring it at the right time. The Express have plenty of that championship experience. While the Lightning only have former Express player Ryan Anderson who won a championship, the first half of Game 1 showed both teams are in it for the long haul.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s turning on a switch but we understand what it\u2019s about,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe understand that this is a new season and the guys came here for a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>The veterans showed up. Robinson had 21 in the half for the Express while Wright had 11 for the Lightning.</p>\n<p>Winning a third title for these teams is not going to come cheaply if Game 1 was any indication.</p>\n<p>The first half was a grinding and tough affair that got nastier as it progressed.</p>\n<p>The Express wound up leading 50-49 but there were 35 fouls called including two unsportsmanlike fouls on the Lightning and a bench technical on the Express that caused Jones to turn and chew out his players.</p>\n<p>The Lightning had 14 more foul shots than the Express in the half. They had the chance to stretch out a lead but they missed an unacceptable 16 foul shots in the game. They also missed three easy layups.</p>\n<p>In a series as close as this one promises to be, giving away points like that will come back to bite you.</p>\n<p>The next game in the series is Sunday at 2 p.m. in London.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=windsorstar.com&#038;blog=79897690&#038;post=705838&#038;subd=postmediawindsorstar2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://windsorstar.com/sports/basketball/windsor-express/express-battle-to-100-98-win-over-lightning-in-series-opener/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/lfp20160512cg353-e1463104107322.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/lfp20160512cg353-e1463104107322.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">London Lightning guard Akeem Scott guards Windsor Express guard Tony Bennett during game 1 of their NBL Canada basketball playoff series at Budweiser Gardens in London, Ont. on Thursday May 12, 2016.</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/20d352ee12971764cc3b86d11f1ff98e?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">postmedianews1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://postmediawindsorstar2.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/lfp20160512cg355.jpg?w=640\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">London Lightning player Tyshawn Patterson flips in the air as he and Windsor Express player Brandon Robinson fight for possession of the ball during game 1 of their NBL Canada basketball playoff series at Budweiser Gardens in London, Ont. on Thursday May 12, 2016.</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://postmediawindsorstar2.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/lfp20160512cg357.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Windsor Express player Maurice Bolden and London Lightning player Akeem Wright chase after a loose ball during game 1 of their NBL Canada basketball playoff series at Budweiser Gardens in London, Ont. on Thursday May 12, 2016.</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://postmediawindsorstar2.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/lfp20160512cg360.jpg?w=640\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">London Lightning player Garrett Williamson is fouled by Windsor Express player Chris Commons during game 1 of their NBL Canada basketball playoff series at Budweiser Gardens in London, Ont. on Thursday May 12, 2016.</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Local artists, organizations recognized by Windsor Endowment for the Arts</title>\n\t\t<link>http://windsorstar.com/entertainment/local-arts/local-artists-organizations-recognized-by-windsor-endowment-for-the-arts</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://windsorstar.com/entertainment/local-arts/local-artists-organizations-recognized-by-windsor-endowment-for-the-arts#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:27:21 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Dalson Chen, Windsor Star]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Local Arts]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Local News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Art Gallery of Windsor]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Arts and Entertainment]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Carolyne Rourke]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Chimczuk Museum]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Cultural Affairs]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Drew Dilkens]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Windsor Endowment for the Arts]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://windsorstar.com/?p=705474</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A selection of local artists and arts organizations received special recognition and support on Thursday night when the Windsor Endowment for the Arts held its biennial grants and awards ceremony.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=windsorstar.com&#038;blog=79897690&#038;post=705474&#038;subd=postmediawindsorstar2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A selection of local artists and arts organizations received special recognition and support&nbsp;on Thursday night when the <a href=\"http://wea-arts.com/\">Windsor Endowment for the Arts</a> held its biennial grants and awards ceremony.</p>\n<p>Every two years, the WEA hands&nbsp;out $18,000 in grants to individuals and groups who enrich the Windsor-Essex community with their artistic efforts.</p>\n<p>Each grant is worth $2,000. There are two categories&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;Emerging Artists and Arts Infrastructure&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;with subcategories for the different aspects of the arts: the visual, literary, performance, and community-oriented.</p>\n<p>There are also non-monetary awards&nbsp;for meritorious arts leadership.</p>\n<p>WEA president Carolyne Rourke said there were 84 applications and nominations for grants and awards this time \u2014&nbsp;compared to 72 in 2014 and 29 in 2012.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It really shows the need,&#8221; Rourke said. &#8220;We want to get the word out: We have this money, and we need to give it out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the ceremony, WEA announced plans to expand its support in 2018: A new grant category, named for Dr. Eric Jackman, will provide $1,000 to the artistic initiative of a high&nbsp;school student or student group.</p>\n<p>As well, the WEA hopes to increase the amount given in future grants. Specific figures remain under discussion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have plans to raise it in some way,&#8221; Rourke said.

Provincial Police working to find the source.</p>\n<p>Many parents chose to keep their children home from school on Thursday, but others feel confident both students and staff are safe given the police presence at the high school, said principal Larry Ash.</p>\n<p>Neither Ash nor school board officials would divulge the nature of the threat or what was written to avoid&nbsp;jeopardizing the police investigation. They would only indicate it was a threat indicating something was to occur at the school on Friday.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe nature of this is something a lot of people are discussing, but we want to leave it to police to analyze and focus on the threat itself so they can get to the bottom of this,\u201d Ash said.</p>\n<p>The high school sent a voice mail message to every parent and will continue to provide updates as the police investigation unfolds, he said.</p>\n<p>It is the second death threat received at a local high school in the past 10 days. <a href=\"http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/students-warn-of-online-threat-about-shooting-at-walkerville-collegiate\">Walkerville Collegiate on May 2 went through a similar occurrence after an online message was posted</a>.</p>\n<p>It was quickly traced by Windsor police to a female student at the school who claimed she was only writing a poem and meant no harm.</p>\n<p>Administrators with&nbsp;the Greater Essex County District School Board said they have not even discussed whether this might be a copycat incident.&nbsp;They are treating the threat at Belle River as an independent and isolated incident, said Vickie Houston, superintendent of education for the public board.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an active criminal investigation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working closely with police and have confidence in the investigation they are doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>A message left with the OPP was not immediately returned.</p>\n<p>After speaking with many parents on Thursday, Ash said several decided to send their children to school, although many others are keeping them home until the situation is resolved.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe mood is one of concern,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had several parents come right in the school to gauge the feeling and many felt fine to have their kids attend.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We do have a police presence, so some feel it\u2019s the safest place in Belle River right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Regular activities were occurring at the school, including a scheduled poverty simulation event, Ash said.</p>\n<p>Belle River high school, with an enrolment of 800 students, has been a school community with a family atmosphere and the threat has left some students angry at what has occurred, Ash said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are upset this is happening and that someone has chosen to do this to them,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople here have a real passion for their community school. We are doing our due diligence to ensure safety.\u201d</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/brdhs/?fref=ts\">parent council posted a message on Facebook</a> about a threat and said that administration was working with the OPP to ensure the safety of students.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that we\u2019re all worried and concerned for our kids,\u201d says the Facebook post. \u201cA threat of any sort being made against our school has to be taken seriously.\u201d</p>\n<p>dbattagello@postmedia.com</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=windsorstar.com&#038;blog=79897690&#038;post=705492&#038;subd=postmediawindsorstar2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/belle-river-high-school-community-alarmed-by-death-threat/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/1n.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/1n.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">The interior of Belle River High School is seen in this file photo.

at its Windsor plant, proves that Canadian auto parts manufacturers can compete on a global scale, CEO Linda Hasenfratz, said Thursday.</p>\n<p>Hasenfratz was among a number of representatives from industry, labour, agriculture, business and public sector groups appearing before the Standing Committee on International Trade, which is&nbsp;holding cross-country public consultations on whether Canada should ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;She urged the federal government to ratify the 12-country agreement, which was negotiated last year by the Stephen Harper Conservatives.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a lot of rhetoric all of you have heard and read that Canadian manufacturing is not competitive, and I have to say I completely disagree,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When I look at our plants in Canada, they are globally competitive. We manage our labour costs very carefully and we&#8217;re constantly working to improve our productivity every single day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Constant enhancements&nbsp;in innovation and productivity are key to competing worldwide, she said, adding that Linamar \u2014&nbsp;which employs 24,000 employees across the globe \u2014&nbsp;is on pace to hit record sales of $6 billion this year. Last year, the auto parts giant announced plans to invest $500 million at its Ontario plants, which employ 9,000 people.</p>\n<p>Its&nbsp;Windsor plant, Exkor Manufacturing, is launching&nbsp;a \u201clong-running, very high volume&#8221; aluminum component program,\u201d &nbsp;for a large assembler, she said in an interview following her submission to the committee.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_705765\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-705765\" src=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/city_red_tape-e1463094885254.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"Linda Hazenfratz, CEO of Linamar Corporation, speaks with the media after community consultations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \"  ><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Linda Hazenfratz, CEO of Linamar Corporation, speaks with the media after community consultations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p></div>\n<p>While she refused to disclose further details, she said the new product would &#8220;absolutely&#8221; lead to additional hiring at the plant, which employs about 200 workers who produce&nbsp;parts such as cylinder heads and precision engine components for automakers, including Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Toyota.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;At Linamar, we\u2019re a big believer in the free market, and trying to reduce trade barriers because bigger markets to sell to and to buy from is just better,&#8221; said Hasenfratz. &#8220;It means we can grow our company larger, we have more opportunities when we have a global stage to work on, so we\u2019re a big fan of TPP and all the other trade agreements Canada has been involved in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If passed&nbsp;by Parliament, TPP&nbsp;would &nbsp;give Canada access to a market of about 800 million people in Japan, Malaysia, the United States, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore. It also would supercede terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, Mexico and the U.S.</p>\n<p>Hasenfratz&#8217;s support for the TPP stood in stark contrast with the doomsday scenarios advanced by opponents ranging from Unifor to the WindsorEssex Economic Development Corporation and the Windsor Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce.</p>\n<p>The TPP &#8220;offers no benefit to Canada&#8217;s auto industry,&#8221; said Dino Chiodo, president of Unifor Local 444, which represents hourly workers at Fiat Chrysler&#8217;s Windsor Assembly Plant. &#8220;It is hard to see how the TPP will attract new auto investment to Canada. Our fear is that it&#8217;ll simply drive it away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unifor has warned that Canada&#8217;s auto assembly and parts&nbsp;industry could lose about 20,000 jobs because of lower content thresholds for vehicles and parts. As well, Canada submitted to further concessions by agreeing to phase out its 6.1 per cent tariff on imported vehicles, while the U.S. protected its tariff for 25 years, said Chiodo.</p>\n<div id=\"pn_video_256456\" itemprop=\"video\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\" itemscope=\"itemscope\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">( function() { pnShowVideo( \"1_ul01bkqy\", 256456, \"\", \"\", false, \"\", \"\", \"kaltura\", \"video\", null, null, \"\" ); } )();</script>\n<p>Chamber of commerce CEO Matt Marchand told the committee that the TPP does not prevent countries from artificially lowering the value of their currencies to make their exports cheaper.</p>\n<p>The agreement&#8217;s consequences will add to the mounting costs faced by Ontario business, Marchand warned. &#8220;Layering TPP in its current form \u2014&nbsp;on top of the existing rising cost environment in Ontario \u2014&nbsp;would set us on a very uncompetitive and damaging economic path, not just in Windsor-Essex but across Ontario and Canada.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rakesh Naidu, interim CEO at the economic development corporation, said&nbsp;the TPP was a threat to the auto industry, which makes up 28 per cent of the region&#8217;s gross domestic product.</p>\n<p>The TPP in its current form is not a &#8220;fair agreement, with a level playing field for all countries and all companies,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>During questioning from the committee about the corporation&#8217;s efforts to attract automakers, other than the Detroit Three, Naidu said he was in discussions with vehicle assemblers in India and China.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Discussions are going on (and) they&#8217;re assessing the business case,&#8221; he said in an interview outside the committee room. &#8220;It&#8217;s a constant process of back and forth. We&#8217;ve been chasing not just Chinese OEMs, but Tier 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;parts&nbsp;suppliers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chinese and Indian car makers are eager to begin selling their vehicles in North America, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They have to get their product ready, they have to have the engineering in place, so that&#8217;s a long pipeline of things they need&nbsp;to do,&nbsp;he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s case as to whether it should be in Mexico, the U.S. or Canada. So we highlight our benefits, our strengths and try to make the case for Essex County.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:gmacaluso@postmedia.com\">gmacaluso@postmedia.com</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=windsorstar.com&#038;blog=79897690&#038;post=705616&#038;subd=postmediawindsorstar2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://windsorstar.com/business/linamars-windsor-plant-getting-high-volume-program-says-ceo/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/city_red_tape-e1463094885254.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/city_red_tape-e1463094885254.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Linda Hazenfratz, CEO of Linamar Corporation, speaks with the media after community consultations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f9f5a8215d1e898689cd131d4d0c3992?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">winstarmacaluso</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://postmediawindsorstar2.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/city_red_tape-e1463094885254.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Linda Hazenfratz, CEO of Linamar Corporation, speaks with the media after community consultations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. </media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Riders upset with Transit Windsor fare hike</title>\n\t\t<link>http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/riders-upset-with-transit-windsor-fare-hike</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/riders-upset-with-transit-windsor-fare-hike#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:48:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Miriam Katawazi, Windsor Star]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Local News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fare hike]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ontario]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Pat Delmore]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tamara Kowalska]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Transit Windsor]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Windsor]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://windsorstar.com/?p=705667</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Transit Windsor is increasing fares for the first time in more than two years, but even a small hike will sting those who use the service the most \u2014 seniors and students.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=windsorstar.com&#038;blog=79897690&#038;post=705667&#038;subd=postmediawindsorstar2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transit Windsor is increasing fares for the first time in more than two years, but even a small hike will sting those who use the service the most \u2014 seniors and students.</p>\n<p>As of June 15, the cost for a single journey fare will rise from $2.75 to $3. The across-the-board hikes will also increase fares for adults, seniors and students.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn transit, it&#8217;s very common that you should be doing regular fare increases,&#8221; Pat Delmore, executive director of Transit Windsor, said Thursday. &#8220;All the costs to providing the service are going up and if you don\u2019t do it consistently then you end up doing much larger increases all at once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both the Affordable Pass Program and the senior pass will&nbsp;rise by $4.40.

I can\u2019t say exactly what that is yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lyons said 40 to 50 teachers are expected to retire this June. They are evenly split between the elementary and secondary panels.</p>\n<p>Lyons said the pleasant surprise is that enrolment is better at the secondary level. That\u2019s an area he said the board expected to take a bit of a hit.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe public board is getting most of the Syrian refugees, but we\u2019re still seeing an increase in enrolment,\u201d Lyons said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only explanation is the reports of people returning home (from other parts of the country).\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the continuation of a trend that surfaced last fall.</p>\n<p>Between the public and Catholic school boards, there were nearly 1,000 more students in the two systems from outside of Essex County as of last October compared to&nbsp;the previous fall</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cI\u2019m optimistic, but there are no guarantees of hiring people in the secondary schools,\u201d Lyons said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking to maintain our enrolment. We\u2019re hoping to be around 20,000 students next year.\u201d</p>\n<p>The public board will see 47 teachers retire this June with 36 of those being elementary teachers.</p>\n<p>Superintendent of education John Howitt, who oversees the elementary schools, said those numbers are comparable to recent years.</p>\n<p>Howitt confirmed the public board will require 15 new French-language teachers to meet the growing interest and the expansion of French&nbsp;immersion.</p>\n<p>Whether any new hires will be required in the rest of the elementary panel won\u2019t be known until enrolment is completed in September.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnrolment for kindergarten is down compared to last year, but we\u2019re finding more parents are registering later,\u201d Howitt said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe expect after late registrations, those number to be closer to last year. We\u2019ll adjust staffing as needed in September.\u201d</p>\n<p>The board has already hired an additional 7.5 teaching positions in it\u2019s English as a Second Language program to meet the needs of Syrian refugees and immigrants from other nations.</p>\n<p>As of today, the board has taken in 301 Syrians and, as of March 21, another 73 non-Syrian immigrants.</p>\n<p>The number of students arriving from other parts of Canada won\u2019t be known until the fall.</p>\n<p>\u201cFifty of the Syrian arrivals are in secondary school and the rest are in elementary,\u201d said Sharon Pyke, a superintendent of education.&nbsp;\u201cThey\u2019re clustered in JK, SK and Grade 1.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve mostly settled in the downtown core.\u201d</p>\n<p>Superintendent of education Vicki Houston, who oversees the public board\u2019s secondary schools, said final staffing levels are still being calculated.</p>\n<p>However, Houston said the board looks to be holding its own in terms of projected secondary enrolment numbers for the fall.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s better (than originally projected),\u201d said Houston, who added final figures will be released after they\u2019re presented to trustees June 7.&nbsp;\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re significantly better, but enrolment projections look good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Public board officials are expecting the fall enrolment to stay around the current level of just over 35,000 students.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:dwaddell@postmedia.com\">dwaddell@postmedia.com</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=windsorstar.com&#038;blog=79897690&#038;post=705622&#038;subd=postmediawindsorstar2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/retirements-stabilizing-enrolment-brighten-job-picture-for-teachers/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/02/windsor-on-september-16-2014-the-greater-essex-county.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/02/windsor-on-september-16-2014-the-greater-essex-county.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">The Greater Essex County District School Board administration office is seen in Windsor.</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/db24ddb5d37dea02596f376b4ceec853?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">winstarwaddell</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Busted!

Government, business, labour and academic leaders all gathered to discuss&nbsp;how to save the auto industry. And they&nbsp;were very frank.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The auto industry must be part of the &#8220;fabric of our being,&#8221; said former Toyota executive Nick Marentette and Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers&#8217; Association president Mark Nantais.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our commitment to this industry must be like that of former U.S. president John F. Kennedy when he vowed to put a man on the moon in 10 years, said Perrin Beatty, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. (It was done&nbsp;in eight years.)</p>\n<p>Because this year&nbsp;will determine whether Canada keeps its single most important industry, said Unifor president Jerry Dias.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know what&#8217;s going to happen if GM closes its plant in Oshawa,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_705775\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-705775\" src=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/auto_policy_forum-1.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"The Honourable Perrin Beatty,  President and Chief Executive Officer, Canadian Chamber of Commerce takes part in the Windsor Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce  Policy &amp; Solutions forum held at the Caboto Club on May 11, 2016. \"  ><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Honourable Perrin Beatty, President and Chief Executive Officer, Canadian Chamber of Commerce takes part in the Windsor Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce Policy &amp; Solutions forum held at the Caboto Club on May 11, 2016.</p></div>\n<p>What about Chrysler&#8217;s paint shop in Brampton? Will&nbsp;Ford invest in its engine plant in Windsor?</p>\n<p>Our share of world production is already plunging.</p>\n<p>It &#8220;scares the hell out of me,&#8221; said Nantais. &#8220;We can lose so much so fast. And when it&#8217;s too late, it&#8217;s too late. It will never come back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is just as serious as when GM and Chrysler faced&nbsp;bankruptcy in 2009, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Government shouldn&#8217;t treat this any different,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Deputy Premier Deb Matthews seemed to get it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have to get our act together,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Half a million Ontarians and their families depend on this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Still,&nbsp;there seemed to be a disconnect.</p>\n<p>We have many advantages, like our highly skilled workforce. But we also have weaknesses. And the first one \u2014&nbsp;again, the panel was frank \u2014&nbsp;is the maze&nbsp;of time-consuming bureaucracy that investors face.</p>\n<p>Everyone talked about ProMexico, that country&#8217;s one-stop shop economic development organization. Anthony Papa, vice-president of Federal Mogul, built a 300,000-square-foot plant there in 18 months. ProMexico helped with everything, from land to labour.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re thinking of investing in Mexico, that country&nbsp;makes it an easy flight path,&#8221; said Peter Frise, scientific director and CEO of Auto21 \u2014&nbsp;which closed after its government funding ended.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_705292\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-705292\" src=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/auto_policy_forum-6.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"Dr. Peter Frise, Scientific Director and CEO of Auto21 during the Windsor Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce  Policy &amp; Solutions forum held at the Caboto Club on May 11, 2016.\"  ><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr. Peter Frise, Scientific Director and CEO of Auto21 during the Windsor Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce Policy &amp; Solutions forum held at the Caboto Club on May 11, 2016.</p></div>\n<p>That&#8217;s not what happens here, acknowledged Ray Tanguay retired chairman of Toyota Canada and auto adviser to the federal and provincial governments here.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In our case, we negotiate. In their case, they facilitate.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We need to change, Matthews agreed.&nbsp;Then she pitched the Red Tape Challenge, a website where you can suggest how to cut red tape. Are you kidding? Other countries have entire branches of government committed to the auto industry, said Papa. We have the Red Tape Challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The high cost of energy here was another concern. But both Matthews and Tanguay downplayed that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Energy rates are a relatively small cost of production,&#8221; Matthews said.</p>\n<p>Ontario has already converted from coal to cleaner energy, said Tanguay. Other countries will have to do that, too, and it will cost them even more.</p>\n<p>Amid all the calls for a national auto strategy, this was among the most revealing of the frank talk Wednesday:</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know what to do,&#8221; said Nantais. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t done it. Twelve years ago, we knew what we had to do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We know what to do. And 2016 is a make-it-or-break-it year. But Tanguay&#8217;s final report won&#8217;t be ready for up to six months.&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_705197\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-705197\" src=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2016/05/windsor-ontario-may-11-2016-l-to-r-unifor-local-444-pr.jpeg?w=640\" alt=\"Unifor Local 444 president Dino Chiodo, left, auto adviser Ray Tanguay and Deputy Premier Deb Matthews listen to automotive experts during the Windsor Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce  Policy &amp; Solutions forum held at the Caboto Club on May 11, 2016.\"  ><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unifor Local 444 president Dino Chiodo, left, auto adviser Ray Tanguay and Deputy Premier Deb Matthews listen to automotive experts during the Windsor Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce Policy &amp; Solutions forum held at the Caboto Club on May 11, 2016.</p></div>\n<p>Windsor lost an opportunity for new small engine production at its Ford plant in 2014 because we didn&#8217;t have a plan, said Dias. Windsor got a retooled, state-of-the-art minivan&nbsp;plant, but Ontario could have gotten more. It could have gotten investment in Chrysler&#8217;s Brampton plant. We didn&#8217;t have a plan.</p>\n<p>As Papa said, we can do this. We&#8217;ve been in this industry for 100 years. Turkey was blip in the auto&nbsp;industry. Now it&#8217;s a dominant force. Why? Because it figured out the impact on its economy and&nbsp;now&nbsp;&#8220;they&#8217;re hungry to build,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the same with Germany. The auto industry isn&#8217;t just another industry in Germany. It&#8217;s a key strategy. By the way, a high percentage of German workers are unionized. It&#8217;s the same in Michigan and other successful U.S. states. When an automaker calls, governors jump. In Michigan, said Papa, &#8220;it&#8217;s like college football. It&#8217;s religion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>All these jurisdictions grapple with disadvantages.
