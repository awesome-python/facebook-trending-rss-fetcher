The number of users in Brazil is said to be about 100 million people.</p>\n<p>But the issue with WhatsApp and other similar apps, including <a href=\"https://www.wickr.com/\">Wickr</a>, is that they guarantee <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000618/end-to-end-encryption\">end-to-end encrypted</a> communications. It&#8217;s this feature that is very popular with those who value personal privacy.</p>\n<p>For criminals, it provides a secure channel for avoiding surveillance of any kind. The only way their planning and operations can be accessed by law enforcement agencies, if they are communicated via WhatsApp, is with the cooperation of the company holding the data.</p>\n<p>But Facebook says it has no power to access the user data anyway. This case appears to echo the same sentiments as those displayed in the recent Apple versus FBI mobile phone incident.</p>\n<p>WhatsApp&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Jan Koum <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jan.koum/posts/10154106409995011\">issued a statement via Facebook</a> explaining why it did not have the data the court was requesting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yet again millions of innocent Brazilians are being punished because a court wants WhatsApp to turn over information we repeatedly said we don&#8217;t have. Not only do we encrypt messages end-to-end on WhatsApp to keep people&#8217;s information safe and secure, we also don&#8217;t keep your chat history on our servers. When you send an end-to-end encrypted message, no one else can read it\u2014not even us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Different Cultures</h2>\n<p>The case is another instance of the lack of clarity between large U.S.-based telecoms and social media companies over collaboration and cooperation with international governments.</p>\n<p>The issue of access to and use of data collected from social media is again happening in a framework of different cultures, varying unexplored attitudes to privacy and within authoritarian legislative systems.</p>\n<p>This case had a short term (and potentially longer term) and successful conclusion. The <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/02/world/whatsapp-suspended-brazil/\">WhatsApp suspension was lifted</a> after 24 hours by another judge.</p>\n<p>But this is not the first time the WhatsApp service has been banned in Brazil. In December 2015, it was <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-17/brazil-judge-blocks-usage-of-facebook-s-whatsapp-for-48-hours\">banned for 48 hours</a>. This was also lifted after about 12 hours.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1947423-how-to-read-a-whatsapp-message-without-triggering-the-blue-tick/\">How to Read a WhatsApp Message Without Triggering the Blue Tick</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1937068-whatsapp-users-need-to-know-about-these-2-key-threats/\">WhatsApp Users Need to Know About These 2 Key Threats</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>Then, in March, the same Brazilian judge who ordered this week&#8217;s ban ordered the vice president of Facebook in Latin America, Diego Dzodan, to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35700733\">be detained by authorities</a> regarding lack of access to WhatsApp data. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/05/facebook-brazil-diego-dzodan-arrest-sao-paulo\">released after 24 hours</a>.</p>\n<p>In all cases, the aim of the judges has been to obtain information about alleged criminal activities such as drug trafficking. The approach may seem heavy-handed, but that could be about to change.</p>\n<p>Brazil is looking at changes to its legislation governing the use of the internet that could see an end to any attempts to shut down any app across the whole country.</p>\n<p>One reform, proposed by lower house deputy Esperidi\u00e3o Amin, would allow the blocking of specific individuals or IP addresses suspected of illicit activity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s less dramatic than withdrawing the service from the whole of the Brazilian population,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-brazil-whatsapp-unblock-idUSKCN0XU1YY\">he told Reuters</a>.</p>\n<h2>Across Borders</h2>\n<p>But this latest case highlights several issues. First, there is an ongoing debate about the nature of the internet and social media. Liberal democracies have an expectation of a right to privacy, but within them, there is an equal demand for efficient law enforcement, solutions to major crime and provision of national security and protection from terrorism.</p>\n<p>Second, companies such as Facebook need to walk carefully and work across different cultures and legal systems to achieve the balance between the demands for security and privacy. It&#8217;s often hard to see how these can be achieved.</p>\n<p>Third, cybersecurity and privacy legislation is still in its infancy in many under-developed economies and advanced applications are being accessed in economies where the legal boundaries are not clear.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, it is very hard to envisage a situation such as this occurring in a country such as Australia, where there has been a more engaged debate over the tension between technology, legislation and privacy.</p>\n<p>In more developed economies, the problems that arise from the tension between privacy and national security have had much more debate, but have not necessarily been resolved for all citizens.</p>\n<p><em>Jill Slay is\u00a0director of the Australian Centre for Cyber Security at the University of New South Wales in\u00a0Australia.\u00a0This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-is-brazil-trying-to-block-whatsapp-58855\">The Conversation</a>.</em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2057162-why-is-brazil-trying-to-block-whatsapp/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Apple Finally Kills Pet Project of Steve Jobs</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2057032-apple-finally-kills-steve-jobs-favorite-project/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2057032-apple-finally-kills-steve-jobs-favorite-project/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:43:12 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/author/giuliana-manca/\" rel=\"author\">Giuliana Manca</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/\" title=\"Epoch Times\" rel=\"publisher\">Epoch Times</a>]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Apple Inc]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[software]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Steve Jobs]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/?p=2057032</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Steve Jobs&#8217; revolutionary program\u00a0has been nixed by Apple, Inc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>WebObjects, which Jobs conceived in 1996, was game-changing when it first appeared.

Companies still made money selling PCs, and some companies, Apple included, grew the number of computers they sold.</p>\n<p>The fact that businesses and homes are replacing their computers less often is not particularly surprising, because computers now are capable of doing everything that people need them to do and are not changing in design to any significant degree.</p>\n<div class=\"pull-quote\"><div class=\"quote-icon\"></div>People are replacing their computers less often because computers are now capable of doing everything people need them to.<br /><div class=\"quote-content\"></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n\n<p>Looking forward, it is unlikely that the iPhone 7 will be particularly different from the iPhone 6S.

(AP Photo/Lisa Marie Pane)</p></div>\n<p>The departments of Justice and Homeland Security said in a report Friday that they expect to complete the work of identifying the smart-gun requirements by October.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The technologies are a reality now,&#8221; said Stephen Teret, a professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies gun violence and gun policies. &#8220;There are obstacles still in getting those technologies into guns and getting guns into the civilian marketplace.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Among them is cost. Modernizing gun manufacturing would mean higher prices for smart weapons.</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s politics. The industry is concerned that success with the technology would encourage the government to mandate it.</p>\n<p>And the powerful gun lobby raises red flags about reliability. What happens if the firearm isn&#8217;t syncing with the radio signal or the fingerprint isn&#8217;t recognized? In a crisis, seconds are precious.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you need it to protect yourself and it doesn&#8217;t work, that&#8217;s a bad outcome,&#8221; said Larry Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents manufacturers. &#8220;Reliability is everything &#8230; If your iPhone doesn&#8217;t work, you&#8217;re inconvenienced. You&#8217;re not dead.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2011802-western-states-seek-ways-to-lower-high-suicide-rates/\">Western States Seek Ways to Lower Suicide Rates</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1960299-domestic-shootings-and-gun-laws-at-a-glance/\">Domestic Shootings and Gun Laws at a Glance</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>Mossberg&#8217;s interest in smart-gun technology stemmed from a rise in police being killed with their own service weapons in the 1990s. Law enforcement didn&#8217;t embrace the idea, preferring to use holsters that made it more difficult for a suspect to disarm an officer.</p>\n<p>He switched gears and began developing a firearm for civilians, only to find resistance there, too. Many people in the focus groups he conducted around the country told him they wanted nothing to do with a gun that contained a circuit board.</p>\n<p>But as personalized technology won greater acceptance\u2014and after mass shootings in Columbine, Colorado; Newtown, Connecticut, and other places seized public attention\u2014opposition faded.</p>\n<p>Mossberg said the shotgun his company is developing has been tested more than 3,000 times with no failures. The next challenge: shrinking the circuit board so it fits into a handgun.</p>\n<h2>From New to Old, Some of the Gun Safety Features Over Time</h2>\n<p>Daytona Beach, Florida-based iGun Technology Corp. has been developing a &#8220;smart gun,&#8221; a firearm that uses a ring with a chip in it to send a signal to a circuit board embedded in the firearm so that only an authorized user can fire the gun.</p>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t the only technology that exists or is being developed.</p>\n<p>A look at other efforts to build a &#8220;smart gun&#8221; and earlier efforts at making firearms safer:</p>\n<p><strong>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)</strong></p>\n<p>Armatix GmbH of Unterfoehring, Germany, has developed a handgun that uses a watch that sends signals to the handgun. The iP1 is a .22-caliber pistol that carries a 10-round magazine. The accompanying watch must be within 10 inches of the handgun for it to fire.</p>\n<p>At least two gun dealers in the United States made it available to customers in 2014\u2014one in California, another in Maryland. Both ceased soon after amid an outcry among gun-rights advocates. One concern is a New Jersey law that mandates that within three years of a smart gun being commercially available, only those types of guns could be bought and sold in the state.</p>\n<p>The cost also is considerably more than a standard handgun, which can generally run around $450. Instead, the iP1 costs more than $1,300 and the buyer also has to purchase the watch separately for an additional several hundred dollars.</p>\n<p><strong>Biometrics</strong></p>\n<p>Among those exploring the use of biometrics\u2014similar to what is used to unlock some iPhones\u2014is a teenager from Colorado. Kai Kloepfer received a grant from the Smart Tech Challenges Foundation to develop the technology, which would fire the handgun only when it recognized a finger placed on the grip.</p>\n<p>Kloepfer was partly inspired by the shooting at a theater in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012, which is about an hour from his home in Boulder. He has since founded Aegen Technologies, a startup company devoted to developing firearms using biometrics and other smart-gun technologies.</p>\n<p>He will be attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this fall after taking a year off after high school to spend more time developing his technology.</p>\n<p><strong>What Other Safety Mechanisms Exist?</strong></p>\n<p>Efforts to make guns safer with technology are not new.</p>\n<p>Many firearms include &#8220;trigger guards,&#8221; the casing that loops under the trigger, and a &#8220;safety&#8221; switch that, when engaged, prevents the gun from firing, for example.</p>\n<p>In the 1880s, Smith &amp; Wesson made a revolver it called &#8220;child-proof.&#8221; It had what is known as a grip safety that must be squeezed at the same time the trigger is pulled for the gun to discharge. The company stopped making firearms with that feature in the 1940s.</p>\n<p>Other companies still use a grip safety, including the iGun Technology shotgun that also includes a programmable ring that sends a signal to the firearm to discharge. Springfield Armory produces a line of handguns with a grip safety, including the XD Compact model. It was involved in an accidental shooting in March. Authorities said a 4-year-old boy in Florida was in the back seat when he shot his mother, who was driving, with the .45-caliber handgun.</p>\n<p><strong>What the Gun Lobby Says</strong></p>\n<p>The gun lobby is wary of the smart-gun technologies and questions their reliability.</p>\n<p>In a crisis, the gun owner needs to have confidence that it&#8217;s a reliable weapon of defense\u2014that it works and works instantaneously.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way to practice for the batteries going dead or just when it doesn&#8217;t recognize your print,&#8221; said Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to be messing with buttons. &#8230; The bad guy in your home isn&#8217;t going to have to boot up his weapon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the gun lobby has reservations about the reliability of the technology, it contends it is not opposed to people looking to develop a smart gun. It is concerned that if a smart gun were successfully brought to market, it would propel the government to then mandate that all firearms have that technology.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We, the industry, are not opposed to R&amp;D and development of this technology. We&#8217;re only opposed to mandates,&#8221; said Larry Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents manufacturers. &#8220;Not everybody wants or needs that feature.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2052230-james-bond-meets-samuel-colt-seeking-to-build-a-safer-gun/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Supreme Court Expands FBI Hacking Power With Rule 41</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2044496-supreme-court-expands-fbi-hacking-power-with-rule-41/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2044496-supreme-court-expands-fbi-hacking-power-with-rule-41/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2016 19:53:23 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/author/denisse-moreno/\" rel=\"author\">Denisse Moreno</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/\" title=\"Epoch Times\" rel=\"publisher\">Epoch Times</a>]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[US News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Department of Justice]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FBI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Google]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[privacy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Supreme Court]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/?p=2044496</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under a request from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Supreme Court decided to expand the FBI&#8217;s hacking authority on April 28.</span></p>\n<p>The rule changes by the country&#8217;s highest court allows U.S. judges to issue warrants to federal officials allowing \u2026</p>]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width=\"676\" height=\"450\" src=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/themes/the-epoch-times-3/images/white.png\"  data-src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/04/13/6a6aa054d485e912950f6a7067009a82-676x450.jpg\" class=\"lazy attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"FILE  - The Supreme Court in this Feb. 17, 2016 file photo.

It&#8217;s going to create chaos,&#8221; said Slava Rubin, CEO and chief business officer of Indiegogo, at a recent <a href=\"http://foodandenterprise.com/\">Food+Enterprise</a> event in New York. Rubin said Indigogo plans to tap its current customers and help them to become part of the upside of equity crowdfunding.</p>\n<p>The law levels the playing field for information and access to opportunity for everyday investors.</p>\n<p>According to Chance Barnett, CEO of <a href=\"http://crowdfunder.com\">crowdfunder.com</a>, writing for Forbes, this will be the first time in over 80\u00a0years that average citizens will have the chance to invest in early-stage companies.</p>\n<p>With the SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) involved, the technicalities of listing a company, as well as investing, are stepping up considerably.</p>\n<p>Under the current rewards-based model, an informal honor code is used. Campaigns are expected to list their goals transparently, and there is trust from investors that they will receive the promised reward.</p>\n<p>With equity crowdfunding, investors will have to jump through some hoops by registering on an SEC or FINRA-approved platform, and taking some financial literacy training to get qualified.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-249.html\">SEC rules</a> will also limit the amount investors can give. Those with annual income or net worth lower than $100,000 will be limited to between $2,000 and about $5,000 yearly. People with earnings over $100,000 can potentially invest up to 10 percent of their income or net worth, with a $100,000 individual cap.</p>\n<p>Companies listing on an equity crowdfunding platform will need to disclose to the SEC and potential investors how they arrived at their company valuation; the background of all officers, directors, and any significant owners; financial statements; and an annual report.</p>\n<p>This is similar to what a public corporation is required to do, with a major difference being that companies seeking to raise less than $1 million are allowed to have their financial statements reviewed rather than audited, which is a major cash savings for a new company.</p>\n<div class=\"pull-quote\"><div class=\"quote-icon\"></div>Millennials are thinking about how to invest differently.<br /><div class=\"quote-content\"></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n\n<p>Dan Miller, co-founder of real estate crowdfunding investment platform <a href=\"https://fundrise.com/about\">Fundrise</a>, calls the changes under Title 3 of the law a &#8220;game changer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaking at Food+Enterprise, Miller said millennials are thinking about how to invest differently, and crowdfunding connects social networks to the market. He said the platforms for equity crowdfunding will include a chat feature to allow for engagement between parties.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The banking market is broken. This is one of the ways we are going to fix it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Kim Wales, founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://walescapital.com/about/who-is-behind-walescapital/\">Wales Capital </a>and CrowdBureau, and a pioneer in working with the government to establish the new provisions, said people today &#8220;want to invest in their built environment in places they are connected to.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For small, independent businesses in particular, she said at Food+Enterprise, &#8220;I really think it is going to be a fundamental shift and a big wave globally for the next few decades.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Chasing Rainbows?</h2>\n<p>Christopher Mims, technology columnist for the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startup-crowdfunding-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be-1449464460\">Wall Street Journal</a>, takes a pessimistic view of equity crowdfunding in his piece &#8220;Tech Startup Crowdfunding Isn&#8217;t All It&#8217;s Cracked Up to Be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In it, he wrote that people who are busy working on the new platforms to offer the service all share an open secret: &#8220;As a mechanism for funding startups like Oculus, it is basically a nonstarter.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2033469\" style=\"width: 590px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2033469\" src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/04/22/Kickstarter_AP_304977789541-580x325.jpg\" alt=\"The Moonspike project launched a Kickstarter campaign to build an actual Moon rocket.

This &#8220;new safe confinement&#8221; will not only safely contain the radioactivity from Reactor 4, but also enable the sarcophagus and the reactor building within to be safely taken apart. This is essential if potential future releases of radioactivity, 100 years or more into the future, are to be prevented.</p>\n<p>Construction of the steel arch-shaped structure began in 2010 and is currently scheduled for completion in 2017. At 110 meters tall with a span of 260 meters, the confinement structure will be large enough to house St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral or two Statues of Liberty on top of one another. But the major construction challenges are not down to size alone.</p>\n<p>The close-fitting arch structure is designed to completely entomb Reactor 4. It will be hermetically sealed to prevent the release of radioactive particles should the structures beneath collapse. Triple-layered, radiation-resistant panels made from polycarbonate-coated stainless steel will clad the arch to provide shielding that will be crucial for allowing people to safely return to the area in <a href=\"http://eng.belta.by/photonews/view/over-20000-people-were-resettled-from-khoiniki-district-after-chernobyl-accident-741/\">ongoing resettlement programs</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2040001\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2040001\" src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/04/26/GettyImages-57077159-674x432.jpg\" alt=\"The Sarcophagus of the Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor number 4 in Chernobyl, Ukraine, on Jan. 25, 2006.

Before work could start, a construction site was prepared 300 meters west of the reactor building, so workers could build the structure without being exposed to radiation. Hundreds of tons of radioactive soil had to be removed from the area, and great slabs of concrete laid to provide extra radiation protection.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2020797-radioactive-wild-boars-have-run-amok-around-fukushima-nuclear-site/\">Radioactive Wild Boars Have Run Amok Around Fukushima Nuclear Site</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2009443-ice-wall-at-fukushima-plant-switched-on-but-will-it-work/\">Ice Wall at Fukushima Plant Switched On, but Will It Work?</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>Inconveniently for a 110 meter-high construction, working above 30 meters is impossible\u2014the higher you go, the closer you get to the top of the exposed reactor core, where radiation dose rates are high enough to pose a significant threat to life. The solution? Build from the top down. After each section of the structure was built, starting with the top of the arch, it was hoisted into the air, 30 meters at a time, and then horizontal supports were added. This was done using jacks that were once used to raise the Russian nuclear submarine, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/05/kursk.russia\">the Kursk</a>, from the bottom of the Barents Sea. The process was repeated until the giant structure reached 110 meters into the air. The two halves of the arch were also constructed separately and have <a href=\"www.ebrd.com/what-we-do/sectors/nuclear-safety/chernobyl-new-safe-confinement.html\">recently been joined together</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPYcU7Uno9o\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The next challenge is to make sure the confinement structure lasts 100 years. In the old sarcophagus, &#8220;<a href=\"www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/12/features/containing-chernobyl\">roof rain</a>&#8221; condensation formed when the inside surface of the roof was cooler than the atmosphere outside, corroding any metal structures it came into contact with. To prevent this in the new structure, a complex ventilation system will heat the inner part of the confinement structure roof to avoid any temperature or humidity differences.</p>\n<p>Finally, a state-of-the-art solution is required to move the confinement structure, which weighs more than 30,000 tons, from its construction site to the final resting place above Reactor 4. The giant building will slide 300 meters along rail tracks, furnished with specially developed <a href=\"https://www.theengineer.co.uk/building-chernobyls-new-safe-confinement/\">Teflon bearings</a>, which will minimize friction and allow accurate positioning.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2040006\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-2040006 size-large\" src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/04/26/GettyImages-520598198-674x449.jpg\" alt=\"A sign warns of radiation contamination near former apartment buildings in Pripyat, near Chernobyl, Ukraine, on April 9, 2016.

This will be done using a remotely operated heavy-duty crane and robotic tools suspended from the new confinement roof. However, the high levels of radioactivity may damage these remote systems, much like the robots that entered the stricken Fukushima core and &#8220;<a href=\"www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/10/these_fukushima_decontamination_bots_are_dying_trying.html\">died trying</a>&#8221; to capture the damage on camera.</p>\n<p>At the very least, building a new confinement structure buys the Ukrainian government more time to develop new radiation-resistant clean-up solutions and undertake the clean-up as safely as possible, all while the radioactive material is decaying. This is an enforced lesson in patience. Only constant innovation in engineering, robotics, and materials will allow nuclear disaster sites like Chernobyl and Fukushima to be made safe, once and for all.</p>\n<p><em>Claire Corkhill is a\u00a0research fellow in nuclear waste disposal at the\u00a0University of Sheffield in the U.K.\u00a0This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/chernobyl-new-tomb-will-make-site-safe-for-100-years-58025\">The Conversation</a>.</em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2039937-chernobyl-new-tomb-will-make-site-safe-for-100-years/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Microsoft Releases iPhone App for One-Handed Typing</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2039013-microsoft-releases-iphone-app-for-one-handed-typing/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2039013-microsoft-releases-iphone-app-for-one-handed-typing/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 22:22:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/author/giuliana-manca/\" rel=\"author\">Giuliana Manca</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/\" title=\"Epoch Times\" rel=\"publisher\">Epoch Times</a>]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iPhone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[keyboard]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[microsoft]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[US]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/?p=2039013</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft&#8217;s keyboard, Word Flow, is now available for iPhone users.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the keyboard is built-in for Windows Phone owners, Microsoft released a <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-flow-keyboard-english/id1077864246?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">version</a>\u00a0on Apple&#8217;s App Store for iPhone and iOS users.</p>\n<p>Available April 25 for free, the Word Flow \u2026</p>]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width=\"676\" height=\"450\" src=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/themes/the-epoch-times-3/images/white.png\"  data-src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/04/15/e85d36b3490741099e2c45fb5c86d3dc-676x450.jpg\" class=\"lazy attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"FILE - This July 3, 2014, file photo, shows the Microsoft Corp. logo outside the Microsoft Visitor Center in Redmond, Wash.

The team was delayed in Asia, as well. When first attempting to fly from Nanjing, China, to Hawaii, the crew had to divert to Japan because of unfavorable weather and a damaged wing.</p>\n<p>A month later, when weather conditions were right, the plane departed from Nagoya in central Japan for Hawaii.</p>\n<p>The plane&#8217;s ideal flight speed is about 28 mph, though that can double during the day when the sun&#8217;s rays are strongest. The carbon-fiber aircraft weighs more than 5,000 pounds, or about as much as a midsize truck.</p>\n<p>The plane&#8217;s wings, which stretch wider than those of a Boeing 747, are equipped with 17,000 solar cells that power propellers and charge batteries. The plane runs on stored energy at night.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2036028\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2036028\" src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/04/23/Solar-Plane_Druk-4-674x449.jpg\" alt=\"Ground crew prepare for the departure of the Solar Impulse 2 solar plane from the Kalaeloa Airport in Kapolei, Hawaii, on April 21, 2016.

(OLO 3D/Youtube)\" /></noscript><p>OLO 3D Inc., a company that created a miniature 3D-printer that works with just\u00a0a simple\u00a0$99 gadget and your smartphone, raised over $2.3 million, concluding its Kickstarter <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/olo3d/olo-the-first-ever-smartphone-3d-printer\" target=\"_blank\">campaign </a>on April 20.</p>\n<p>The company\u00a0plans to start shipping the devices to its U.S. backers in September, and internationally in November.</p>\n<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>\n<p>OLO uses materials called Daylight Resins. They are liquid, but solidify when exposed to the white light emitted by smartphone displays.</p>\n<p>To print an object, you load the design file on the OLO app, put a transparent screen over the display of your phone, place the device on top of it, and pour in the resin.</p>\n<p>The device is a plastic box that blocks outside light and also prevents the resin from spilling out. It also has a &#8220;building plate&#8221;&#8212;a plate inside that can move up and down in the box thanks to a battery powered motor.</p>\n<p>Then the app lights up individual parts of the smartphone&#8217;s display causing the resin right on top of those parts to solidify. At the same time, these solidifying parts stick to the &#8220;building plate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When the first bits of resin solidify, the &#8220;building plate&#8221; moves up a little. And because the solidified resin stuck to the plate, it will move up together with it.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1997978-student-3d-prints-own-braces-saves-almost-8000/\">Student 3-D-Prints Own Braces, Saves Almost $8,000</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the app lights up different parts of the display causing another layer of resin to solidify and stick to the other solid resin parts.</p>\n<p>As the bits of resin continuously solidify, the building plate gradually\u00a0moves up, pulling the 3D-printed object out of the resin.</p>\n<p>It really seems like the object grows out of your smartphone&#8217;s screen. In reality though, it grows out of the little puddle of resin that reacts to the light emitted by your phone.</p>\n<h2>Creation</h2>\n<p>OLO was created by Italian 3D-printing veterans Filippo Moroni and Pietro Gabriele. They&#8217;ve spent over\u00a015 years in the field and have already designed several 3D-printers.</p>\n<p>Yet even as the technology became more affordable, the cheapest 3D-printers still cost a couple hundred dollars. Even as more and more people have 3D-printers, the machines are often\u00a0lying around idle,\u00a0Gabriele told Epoch Times in a phone interview.</p>\n<p>Moroni and\u00a0Gabriele wanted to create a 3D-printer that anybody could afford (though we&#8217;re still talking about people with smartphones who can afford a $99 gadget).</p>\n<p>They wanted to &#8220;democratize&#8221; 3D-printing and also to give people a way to easily try out 3D-printing, so as to inspire more people to use the technology and give all those idle machines something to do.</p>\n<p>The technology is already here. Dentists have been using light curing resins for decades and there have already been some 3D-printers that used resins cured by ultraviolet light.</p>\n<p>Moroni and\u00a0Gabriele just needed a resin that would react to the specific light of\u00a0smartphone displays.</p>\n<p>At the same time, because OLO is powered by a smartphone app, people can download and share their designs online and send them to each other as messages straight from the app.</p>\n<p>Gabriele said they received pledges from some developing countries with a message that their device gives some people the first chance to try 3D-printing.</p>\n<p>With all the possibilities ahead, the only\u00a0remaining\u00a0question: What will users of the app create?</p>\n<h2>Specs</h2>\n<p>The company boast printing resolution up to 42 microns. The gadget is powered by four AA batteries and the resins are available in different colors, including translucent.</p>\n<p>You can use different smartphones, including large ones like iPhone 6+ or Galaxy 7, but not ones with curved displays. Also the phone needs to be connected to a charger and in &#8216;airplane mode&#8217; with WiFi and all alerts and notifications off.</p>\n<p>The printing speed depends on the display brightness. Apple&#8217;s iPhone 6 can print an object an inch tall in about 2 hours.</p>\n<p>The transparent screen (or rather film) you put on top of your phone&#8217;s display needs to be replaced after every 3 prints, the company states. It&#8217;s not advisable\u00a0to pour the resin straight onto your phone&#8217;s display, so the film seems necessary. It cost $5 per 20-pack.</p>\n<p>You also need to clean the device after each print&#8212;wiping it with paper towel and then with rubbing alcohol. You can pour the remaining resin back in the bottle (but you&#8217;ll need to fish out all solid pieces out of it).</p>\n<p>OLO also advertises it can open common 3D software formats, like\u00a0.STL, .OBJ, and .PLY, so you can print a\u00a0variety of designs, as long as they fit in the box (maximum volume is\u00a03 x 5 x 2 inches).</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1945145-ultrasound-could-transform-3d-printing-for-a-future-of-smart-materials/\">Ultrasound Could Transform 3D Printing for a Future of Smart Materials</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>The resins come in 100 ml (3.4 oz) bottles at $15 each and have an expiration date of about one year. You also should store them in a dry place at room temperature (50-95 degrees Fahrenheit) and don&#8217;t expose them to light (they come in black bottles).</p>\n<p>OLO will cost $99.</p>\n<p>If you think OLO is just too small to be practical, the company plans to release a version for tablets next year.</p>\n<h2>\u00a0</h2>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2030359-gadget-that-seemingly-3d-prints-objects-out-of-your-phones-display-raised-2-3m-on-kickstarter/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Google Warns That Google.com Services Are Potentially Dangerous</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2030952-google-warns-that-google-com-is-potentially-dangerous/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2030952-google-warns-that-google-com-is-potentially-dangerous/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 20:29:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/author/jonathan-zhou/\" rel=\"author\">Jonathan Zhou</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/\" title=\"Epoch Times\" rel=\"publisher\">Epoch Times</a>]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Google]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/?p=2030952</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Watch out for Google, says Google.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s Safety Browsing tool, which evaluates websites on how likely they are to infect you with things like malware, had put\u00a0Google.com in the &#8220;partially dangerous&#8221; category.\u00a0</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some pages on this website install malware \u2026</p>]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width=\"676\" height=\"450\" src=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/themes/the-epoch-times-3/images/white.png\"  data-src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/15/AP_1603152035502625-676x450.jpg\" class=\"lazy attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"The Google logo is seen at the Google headquarters in Brussels on March 23, 2010.

On gaming and technology sites, the ad blocking\u00a0can go up to 40 percent.\u00a0Ad block applications have been\u00a0the No. 1 sellers in the iPhone App Store, according to AdSupply.</p>\n<div class=\"pull-quote\"><div class=\"quote-icon\"></div>Ad block is a threat to the very existence of the World Wide Web.<br /><div class=\"quote-content\"><span class=\"author\">\u2014 AdSupply</span></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n\n<p>To fight ad blockers, a number of solutions have emerged in recent years. However, AdSupply thinks its BlockIQ solution is superior to others:</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are bypassing the ad block. We are circumventing it to allow the sites to control their experiences. That is the primary difference. We have not really seen any competitor doing the same thing in terms of bypassing,&#8221;\u00a0Bunnell told the Epoch Times.</p>\n<p>According to him, most competitors are using\u00a0<a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads\">Acceptable Advertising</a>, which has been\u00a0introduced by leading ad blocker\u00a0<a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/\">Adblock Plus</a>. The solution has a set of rules about online advertising. However, compliance is judged by\u00a0the ad blocker. If the ads are compliant, the ads will be added to the &#8220;whitelist&#8221; and will not be blocked.</p>\n<p>Companies including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/criteo-pays-adblock-plus-to-appear-on-its-acceptable-ads-whitelist-2015-12\">pay huge fees</a> to Adblock Plus to get their ads whitelisted, according to media reports.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You have the process where they dictate how a website can run. They are dictating to the publisher who put their time and effort to create this website and they are telling what they can and cannot do. And that is the way our competitors are approaching it,&#8221; said Bunnell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>&#8220;We reject acceptable ad policy because we feel the publisher has the right to have advertising and they have the right to make money from their work. So that is the big difference between us and most of our competitors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to bypassing, there is another system called the &#8220;pass wall system.&#8221; There are companies using texts, like Forbes. &#8220;If you use an ad block, they say you cannot go to\u00a0our website. There are a couple of companies using that kind of system that asks users to turn off their ad blocking. So there are two approaches to overcome ad blocking,&#8221; said Bunnell.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2029709\" style=\"width: 497px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2029709\" src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/04/19/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-4.12.12-PM.png\" alt=\"(The-digital-reader.com)\" width=\"487\" height=\"409\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">(The-digital-reader.com)</p></div>\n<p>BlockIQ works by detecting if users are running ad blockers and offers publishers and advertisers three options. One of the options is to display a welcome message that explains the value of the website and the damage to the community inflicted by ad blocking.</p>\n<p>The second option is to protect the publisher&#8217;s content behind the BlockIQ Passwall system that refuses to serve content until its site is whitelisted. (Visitors configure Adblock to allow ads from that website.) \u2028The last option: The BlockIQ BlockBypass system can just push ads past the ad blocking to the visitor.</p>\n<p>AdSupply&#8217;s programmatic online marketplace is ranked by comScore as the 21st-largest online advertising network. The company had revenues of $18.5 million in 2015. In order to gain competitive advantage through size and scale, AdSupply recently agreed to merge with Adaptive Medias Inc. (<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ADTM\">OTCQB: ADTM</a>), a video technology provider for publishers, content producers, and brand advertisers.</p>\n<p>The combined company will benefit from BlockIQ&#8217;s leadership and Adaptive Medias&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.adaptivem.com/platform/\">Media Graph</a> technology. Media Graph provides the ability to monetize digital video content across all screens and devices through one centralized solution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the Internet rapidly migrating to HTML5 video, especially on mobile devices, we must be well positioned in this space and Media Graph is the next generation, a state-of-the-art platform that would otherwise take us two or more years to build on our own,&#8221; said Bunnell regarding the merger deal.</p>\n<p>Mobile video will represent 72 percent of global mobile data traffic by 2019, up from 55 percent in 2014, according to <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/mobile-white-paper-c11-520862.html\">Cisco\u00a0Systems</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everything is moving toward video and it is moving fast on all devices. When you go to websites like ESPN, everything is video,&#8221; said John Strong, chairman and CEO of Adaptive Medias Inc.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Video is effective, interesting, and gets attention. So advertisers definitely like it more than a simple display. This does not mean display advertising is going away, but video is moving so quickly that it is getting a larger online content pie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With respect to consolidation in the digital advertising industry, both companies expect to see more mergers in the near future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think you are going to see a lot more consolidation right away. You just have to have a big footprint, more comprehensive operating products so you can be a one-stop provider,&#8221; said Strong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>&#8220;You will see many companies start to either sell smaller pieces into a larger business or merge into other companies that are complementary.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2029615-how-one-startup-is-blocking-ad-blockers/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Brooklyn Microgrid World&#8217;s First Peer-to-Peer, Blockchain Energy Transaction</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2027695-worlds-first-peer-to-peer-energy-transaction-on-the-blockchain-has-arrived/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2027695-worlds-first-peer-to-peer-energy-transaction-on-the-blockchain-has-arrived/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 03:18:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/author/stuart-liess/\" rel=\"author\">Stuart Liess</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/\" title=\"Epoch Times\" rel=\"publisher\">Epoch Times</a>]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Companies]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NY News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Andrew Cuomo]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[blockchains]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[microgrids]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[solar energy]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/?p=2027695</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK\u2014The future in peer-to-peer consumer energy exchange is here.

As Orsini puts it, &#8220;Bitcoin is to blockchain like Kleenex is to tissue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo started the <a href=\"https://www.ny.gov/programs/reforming-energy-vision-rev\">&#8220;Reforming the Energy Vision</a>&#8221; strategy after Hurricane Sandy left two million people in New York without power in 2011.\u00a0 It is a bid to clean up the state and promote better energy efficiency in the form of microgrids, roof-top solar installations, and so on,\u00a0as well as providing affordability and a wider choice for customers in how they manage and consume their energy.</p>\n<p>In Feb. 2015, Cuomo requested adding <a href=\"http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Newsroom/2015-Announcements/2015-02-11-Governor-Announces-Launch-of-NY-Prize-Microgrid-Competition\">a $40 million incentive</a>\u00a0for a number of microgrids to be designed that could run parallel to\u00a0the national grid. In the event of a storm, like Hurricane Sandy, they could separate and become independent from the main grid\u00a0so that if\u00a0the main grid gets knocked out, power remains for selected areas.</p>\n<p>According to Orsini, 30 percent of the energy content of the resources that are taken from the ground are lost in the production of energy in power plants.\u00a0And another 7 percent is lost when the energy is\u00a0transported from the power plant to a remote building.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is a much more sane way to build a utility infrastructure,&#8221; says Orsini, who likes to think of microgrids as not being &#8220;disruptive to utilities but as evolving utilities.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1890658-liquid-solar-company-develops-wires-as-thin-as-human-hairs/\">Liquid Solar Company Develops Wires as Thin as Human Hairs</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>Connecticut became the first state in the United States to launch <a href=\"http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=4405&amp;Q=508780\">a microgrid program</a> in 2003, pledging $18 million in grants to over nine projects throughout the state.

For example, robots cannot ignore the principles of <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter1_rule1\">distinction between civilians and combatants</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter4_rule14\">proportionality in the scale of attack</a>.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1876849-the-perverse-rise-of-killer-robots/\">The Perverse Rise of Killer Robots</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/915602-forget-killer-robots-its-the-rise-of-the-cyborgs/\">Forget Killer Robots, It&#8217;s the Rise of the Cyborgs</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>Human commanders would also have command responsibility for their robots, just as they do for their service men and women. Robots cannot be lawfully used to perpetrate genocide, massacres, and war crimes.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, there are broadly four positions that the various nations took.</p>\n<p><strong>Position 1: Rely on Existing Laws</strong></p>\n<p>The U.K.&#8217;s position is that existing international humanitarian law is sufficient to regulate emerging technologies in artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/au/topics/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>) and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/au/topics/robotics\">robotics</a>.</p>\n<p>The argument is that international humanitarian law was sufficient to regulate aeroplanes and submarines when they emerged, and it will also cope with many kinds of LAWS too. This would include <a href=\"http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/224/Article/104469/mq-1b-predator.aspx\">Predator drones</a> with an &#8220;ethical governor&#8221;\u2014which is software designed to determine whether a strike conforms with the specified rules of engagement and international humanitarian law\u2014or autonomous anti-submarine warfare ships, such as the U.S. Navy&#8217;s experimental autonomous <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/program/anti-submarine-warfare-continuous-trail-unmanned-vessel\">Sea Hunter</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Position 2: Ban Machine Learning</strong></p>\n<p>The French delegation said a ban would be &#8220;premature&#8221; and that they are open to accepting the legality of an &#8220;<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/we-need-to-keep-humans-in-the-loop-when-robots-fight-wars-53641\">off the loop</a>&#8221; LAWS with a &#8220;human in the wider loop.&#8221; This means the machine can select targets and fire autonomously, but humans still set the rules of engagement.</p>\n<p>However, they were open to regulating <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning\">machine learning</a> in &#8220;off the loop&#8221; LAWS (which do not yet exist). Thus, they might support a future ban on any self-learning AI\u2014similar to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ai-has-beaten-us-at-go-so-what-next-for-humanity-55945\">AlphaGo</a>, which recently beat the human world Go champion\u2014in direct control of missiles without humans in the wider loop.

href=\"http://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html\">Fiber optics</a> allow for the communication of data at the speed of light.</p>\n<p>But the amount of data that can be sent along any optic fiber is limited by how much information you can encode into the light wave travelling through it.</p>\n<p>Currently, optic fiber technology uses several different properties of light to encode information, including brightness, color, polarization, and direction of propagation.</p>\n<p>But if we want to cram even more information through optic fiber, we need to use other features of light to encode more information, without disrupting currently used properties.</p>\n<p>Such a feature could help boost the bandwidth of optic fiber technology, including our Internet speeds.</p>\n<p><div

There&#8217;s a lot of misconception about what a dirty bomb is and how one may be used in a greater strategic context. Here are five things you should know about dirty bombs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A dirty bomb is not a nuclear bomb.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/01/dealing-with-dirty-bombs-plain-facts-practical-solutions\">A dirty bomb</a>, or radiation dispersion device (RDD), is simply an explosive device laced with radioactive material. The destructive power of a nuclear bomb is exponential compared to a dirty bomb. Furthermore,\u00a0a much greater level of technological sophistication is needed to create the nuclear reaction necessary for\u00a0a nuclear weapon relative to simply exploding dynamite.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Dirty bombs have a greater psychological impact.</strong> The greatest immediate damage from a dirty bomb comes from the explosion itself. How radioactive material is spread from the explosion can be factor to a number of things, such as the scale of the explosion, the type of radioactive material used, and even wind patterns. The greatest physical danger from radiation might come from inhaling or ingesting of this material. However, most dirty bombs would not release <a href=\"http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/fs-dirty-bombs.html\">enough radiation</a>\u00a0to kill people.

Fission bombs are fueled with fissile material such as uranium and plutonium. When detonated, the atoms in the weapon&#8217;s core split and release huge amounts of energy\u2014producing a nuclear explosion. Thermonuclear weapons use a fission bomb to ignite special fuel, consisting of light hydrogen isotopes. These nuclei are forced together\u2014undergoing nuclear fusion\u2014releasing an even larger explosion.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2012521-our-collective-nuclear-nightmare/\">Our Collective Nuclear Nightmare</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2011290-world-leaders-warn-of-harrowing-risk-of-nuclear-armed-terrorists/\">World Leaders Warn of Harrowing Risk of Nuclear-Armed Terrorists</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/20057/nuclear_terrorism_fact_sheet.html\">no indications</a> that a terrorist group has obtained any fissile material to date. If they could it would be possible for them to build a fission device, although this does pose a huge technical challenge. While highly engineered weapons need only <a href=\"http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/205028/significantly-wrong-about-significant-quantities/\">a few kilograms</a> of fissile material, a crude terrorist-built design would require far more. Thermonuclear weapons, on the other hand, are too complex for terrorist groups to develop.</p>\n<p>An easier option for a terrorist group would be to build a dirty bomb or, technically, a radiological dispersal device. These do not rely on complex nuclear reactions. Instead, conventional explosives are used to disperse radioactive material, contaminating an area with elements such as radioactive isotopes of cobalt, cesium, or americium.</p>\n<p>Under the command of Shamil Basayev, a Chechen separatist leader, militants <a href=\"http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/chechen-resistance-radiological-terror/\">buried a dirty bomb in a Moscow park</a> in 1995. Basayev threatened to turn Moscow into &#8220;an eternal desert&#8221; unless his demands were met. The weapon was not detonated. The episode was a terrorist publicity stunt\u2014threatening to use unconventional weapons against Russian civilians. But it did show that a dedicated group could build and use a dirty bomb.</p>\n<h2>How Dangerous Is a Dirty Bomb?</h2>\n<p>Although dirty bombs do not produce catastrophic explosions they can nevertheless be deadly. Radioactive materials produce ionizing radiation which can destroy bodily tissues and create harmful mutations that lead to cancer. The danger posed by radioactive material depends on the means of exposure and type of radiation it produces. Alpha radiation is harmful only if inhaled or ingested, while other types\u2014known as beta and gamma radiation\u2014can penetrate and damage human tissue even if the material is external to the body.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2008267-is-belgiums-nuclear-security-up-to-scratch/\">Is Belgium&#8217;s Nuclear Security up to Scratch?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1971877-radioactive-material-feared-to-end-up-with-isis-found-in-iraq/\">Radioactive Material Feared to Have Been Obtained by ISIS Has Been Found</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>In 1987,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub815_web.pdf\">two men stole a teletherapy unit</a> from an abandoned cancer clinic in Goiania, Brazil, believing its parts might have scrap value. The unit contained a heavily shielded <a href=\"http://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/isotopes/cesium.asp\">cesium-137 radioactive source</a> which produced high-intensity gamma radiation. When the source was removed from its case, both men received full-body exposure to the penetrating radiation. They worked for several days to remove the cesium, drawn to the fascinating blue glow emanating from an aperture normally used to direct a radiation beam towards malignant tumors.</p>\n<p>Experiencing diarrhea and vomiting from their unwitting exposure (which they attributed to food poisoning) the men gave the cesium to their family and friends as gifts. One father gave the glowing material to his daughter who played with it for several hours. She was one of four individuals to succumb to radiation injuries a short time later.</p>\n<p>Twenty people developed <a href=\"http://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/arsphysicianfactsheet.asp\">acute radiation syndrome</a> from the exposure. This is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms, immune system disruption, potential loss of consciousness, and death. Those who handled the cesium also developed <a href=\"http://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/criphysicianfactsheet.asp\">local radiation injuries</a> such as erythema (skin reddening), blisters and ulcers, desquamation (skin shedding), and tissue necrosis (premature death of cells in the tissue).</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1885380-despite-threats-africa-is-looking-to-nuclear-with-russia-and-chinas-help/\">Despite Threats, Africa Is Looking to Nuclear With Russia and China&#8217;s Help</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1873482-nuclear-black-market-seeks-is-extremists/\">Nuclear Black Market Seeks ISIS Extremists</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>The event caused widespread panic about contamination in Goiania. Some 112,000 people (10 percent of the population) sought help, overwhelming local health care services. Decontamination costs ran into tens of millions of dollars, buildings were demolished and contaminated top-soil was removed. Public fears also stoked an unofficial boycott of locally produced goods <a href=\"http://www.veneermagazine.com/01-18/01/the_group/goiania.html\">which dropped in price by 40 percent</a> and tourism collapsed.</p>\n<p>Despite the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) calling it &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/time-to-better-secure-radioactive-materials/2012/03/23/gIQAn5deaS_story.html\">one of the world&#8217;s worst radiological incidents</a>,&#8221; only four lives were lost. However, the psychological effect on the population, the protracted clean-up and economic disruption suggest a terrorist dirty bomb can nevertheless have a huge impact. Over the long term, the effects of contamination have been largely social. Public fears of coming in contact with contamination have led to <a href=\"http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/20/008/20008221.pdf\">discrimination against survivors</a>.

A strong, regulatory regime and effective controls on the sale and transport of dangerous radioactive sources can certainly mitigate the threat. Alternative technologies can <a href=\"http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/publications/report/TreatmentNotTerror212.pdf\">sometimes replace radioactive sources</a> used in medicine. Another option is to install radiation detection equipment at ports and border crossings to identify unauthorized transport of dangerous material.</p>\n<p>Dirty bombs are certainly easier for terrorist groups to produce than nuclear weapons.

Are we heading towards mass unemployment as computers and robots do all the work? The short answer is no.</p>\n<p>The economy can be expected to create new jobs at a commensurate rate at which it extinguishes existing jobs.

We are entering into an era of more rapid than usual technology-fueled disruption of labor markets.</p>\n<p>The exponential growth in device connectivity, platform economies, e-commerce, social media use, computing power, data volumes, and overall Internet penetration will change the nature of work. Some are suggesting that platform economics and <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/10/gig-economy\">the new gig economy</a> are set to challenge the longstanding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm\">theory of the firm</a> by Nobel Prize laureate Ronald Coase and fundamentally restructure the way labor is organized.</p>\n<p>Such sudden shocks have happened in the past. The industrial revolution of 1750\u20131850 saw the invention and widespread adoption of the steam engine, spinning wheels, cement, chemicals, and many other technologies.

A study by Charles Feinstein, economic historian at the University of Oxford, finds that <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2566618?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">average real weekly</a> earnings for workers in the United Kingdom increased at the rate of 0.4 percent per annum over 75 years (1782 to 1857).</p>\n<p>Other quality-of-life indicators reveal similar patterns of sluggish growth. From 1800 to 1860, the life expectancy (at birth) for the population in provincial cities (over 100,000 inhabitants) in England and Wales <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2599693\">remained roughly constant</a> at 41 years and living standards declined for many of the new urban industrial workforce. It wasn&#8217;t until after 1860 that life expectancy began to rise, reaching 47 years by 1900, along with improvements in living standards.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2004827-traditional-business-models-wont-survive-a-robot-takeover/\">Traditional Business Models Won&#8217;t Survive a Robot Takeover</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1963992-small-businesses-hold-key-to-recession-and-recovery/\">Small Businesses Hold Key to Recession and Recovery</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s quite a sobering thought.

Also, residential electric rates, on average about <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/7?agg=2,0,1&amp;geo=g&amp;freq=M\">12 cents per kilowatt-hour</a> in in the United States, are much higher than wholesale electric rates\u2014the price utilities pay to power generators\u2014which are usually <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/wholesale/\">less than 4 cents per kilowatt-hour</a>.</p>\n<p>At the same time, different states have more or less sun\u2014solar power in Florida is typically more economic than in Alaska, for instance. All of these factors make the question more complicated than people might anticipate.</p>\n<p>How, then, can we compare the cost of rooftop solar to the cost of buying power from the local electricity grid and thereby find when which states will hit the point of grid parity?</p>\n<h2>Putting a Number on Solar Cost</h2>\n<p>The levelized, or average, cost of electricity from a solar PV array is derived from all the money spent to buy, install, finance and maintain the system divided by the total amount of electricity that system is expected to produce over its lifetime. We call this value the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and it&#8217;s expressed in terms of dollars per kilowatt-hour ($/kWh). The same metric can be used to determine the cost for a coal or natural gas plant. Planners like it because it reduces the cost of a power plant over a span of many decades into a single number.</p>\n<p>Despite the strengths of LCOE as a metric\u2014it is easy to understand and widely used\u2014it has some shortcomings, too. Namely, it leaves out geographic variability, changes with seasons and usually ignores the cost of environmental impacts such as the cost of carbon emissions. This metric is a bit too simple when comparing variable wind and solar generators to power plants that you can turn on and off at will, such as those fueled by uranium, coal and natural gas.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1986212-utilities-solar-energy-and-the-fight-for-your-roof/\">Utilities, Solar Energy and the Fight for Your Roof</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1972461-president-container-builds-solar-array-and-good-relationships/\">President Container Builds Solar Array and Good Relationships</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>Today the average cost of energy from solar PV in the\u00a0United States\u00a0is reported to be <a href=\"http://about.bnef.com/press-releases/wind-solar-boost-cost-competitiveness-versus-fossil-fuels/\">12.2 cents per kWh</a>, which is about the same as the average retail rate.</p>\n<p>Those who keep close tabs on electricity prices might think that it is about on par with what they are paying for their own electricity at home.

Ultimately, that depends on two things: how much you pay for the electricity you buy from the local grid, and how much can you get paid for the electricity you can produce from PV. Let&#8217;s take a look at both of them.</p>\n<h2>How Much Sun Do You Get?</h2>\n<p>The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has created a <a href=\"http://en.openei.org/wiki/Utility_Rate_Database\">map of average electricity rates by zip code</a>, averaged to the county level and remade by the author in the map below.

The main assumptions behind the data are a total cost of <a href=\"http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight-report-2015-q1\">$3.50/Watt for the solar PV installation</a> for a fixed array pointing south with a tilt of 25 degrees.

Cheap PV panels from China have driven down the hardware costs to the point where the price of a total PV system is now dominated by &#8220;soft costs&#8221;\u2014namely, customer acquisition, installation, supply chain, permit, etc. Still, total installed system costs continue to fall.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1952362-the-cheapest-way-to-scale-up-wind-and-solar-energy-high-tech-power-lines/\">The Cheapest Way to Scale Up Wind and Solar Energy?

Obviously, some locations are sunnier than others so a solar array in Arizona will produce more energy than one in Washington state, making the system more economic for the homeowner.</p>\n<p>And, the prevailing cost of electricity varies nationwide. Some of the areas with the lowest cost of grid power (e.g., Washington) have some of the highest solar costs because of low levels of sunshine. It will be difficult to make solar reach parity in those locations.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are other locations where the price of grid electricity is high and the solar LCOE is relatively low, including New Mexico, California and Hawaii; these places are prime locations for solar to be at parity sooner.</p>\n<h2>Moving Target</h2>\n<p>To illustrate this point, we take the same information that underlies the solar cost map and reduce the total installed cost of installed solar in $0.50/Watt increments\u2014from $3.50/Watt to $1.50/Watt (the SunShot goal). We can then subtract the electricity rate from the solar LCOE in every county. Where this difference is zero or negative (electricity rates &gt; LCOE), we can estimate when that county will be at grid parity for residential solar PV.</p>\n<p>Below is a GIF that shows the estimate of the point of parity as the price of installed solar falls. Note that the total installed costs include the federal investment tax credit and any local rebates and tax incentives.</p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \"><img src=\"https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/116825/width754/image-20160330-28443-1pez921.gif\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<figcaption> <span class=\"caption\">GIF showing the locations where residential solar LCOE reaches parity with local average electric rates at various solar installed costs.</span> </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>These calculations and estimates come with several caveats. First, the above calculation assumes that PV owners are paid for their generation at standard electric rates in their area. This arrangement is typically known as net metering.</p>\n<p>But there is a wide range of ways that utilities interact with customers who have installed solar PV. Some utilities may pay homeowners wholesale market rates for the excess electricity they feed into the grid from their panels, which tend to be considerably lower than retail rates. If utilities pay homeowners based on the wholesale rate, rather than the retail rate, solar is less economic.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1893991-if-a-solar-plant-uses-natural-gas-is-it-still-green/\">If a Solar Plant Uses Natural Gas, Is It Still Green?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1890658-liquid-solar-company-develops-wires-as-thin-as-human-hairs/\">Liquid Solar Company Develops Wires as Thin as Human Hairs</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1883617-solar-panels-just-got-a-little-bit-brighter/\">Solar Panels Just Got a Little Bit Brighter, and More Efficient</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not all. One could add in the cost benefits of reducing CO2 emissions and other pollutants. On the other hand, there are costs associated with &#8220;firming up&#8221; the solar power when it&#8217;s nighttime or cloudy.</p>\n<p>Keeping these factors in mind, the answer to the question, &#8220;Does it make economic sense for me to install solar?&#8221; is: it depends. As the map demonstrates, the crucial thing to watch, apart from any changes in electricity costs, is how quickly the overall costs of solar go down.<img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/54789/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><em>Joshua D.

So for example if a visual inspection is required at a distance close to the entrance point, then the use of endoscope technology (a small camera and light within a flexible tube) could be used through a hole as small a millimeter in diameter.</p>\n<p>At this scale, very close up images can be obtained, but providing enough light to illuminate the space for a large scale inspection is unlikely to be feasible. As the hole size increases, image quality is improved and tools such as grippers and sample collectors can be used.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration operates GOES with contributions from NASA.</p>\n<p>Historically, two main challenges exist when using satellite data for hurricane predictions\u2014the type and amount of data collected. Satellites don&#8217;t directly measure many quantities related to a hurricane&#8217;s intensity, such as surface pressure, wind speeds, temperature, and water vapor beneath the cloudy regions of the hurricane eyewall.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1879491-how-scientists-know-what-makes-climate-work/\">How Scientists Know What Makes Climate Work</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1997696-goodbye-weather-channel-oombrella-can-predict-the-weather/\">Goodbye Weather Channel, Oombrella Can Predict the Weather</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>They do, however, collect data known as brightness temperature, which show how much radiation is emitted by objects on Earth and in the atmosphere at different infrared frequencies. Because all objects naturally emit and absorb different amounts of radiation at different frequencies, the complexity of data poses challenges to researchers hoping to use these data for hurricane prediction models.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At some frequencies water vapor absorbs moderate amounts of radiation passing through it, at other frequencies it absorbs most of that radiation, and at other frequencies it absorbs hardly any at all,&#8221; says Eugene Clothiaux, professor of meteorology.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unlike water vapor, clouds strongly absorb radiation at all of these frequencies. Comparing measurements at different frequencies leads to information about water vapor and clouds at different altitudes above the Earth. This begins to tell us about the physical structure of water vapor fields and clouds, including those in the area around a hurricane.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Brightness Data</h2>\n<p>Using brightness temperature satellite data to improve model forecasts of hurricanes is not straightforward. Brightness temperature information is a complex mixture related to the ground, atmospheric water vapor, and clouds. Researchers had to develop a sophisticated analysis and modeling scheme to extract information in useful ways for model forecasts.</p>\n<p>The team demonstrated in a pilot study that it is becoming feasible to use brightness data. They found definitive correlations between measurements of brightness temperature and information about the storm\u2014wind speed and sea level pressure underneath the hurricane. Their findings are reported in the current issue of <em><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL068468\" target=\"_blank\">Geophysical Research Letters</a></em>.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1948794-what-we-know-key-takeaways-from-massive-winter-storm/\">What We Know: Key Takeaways From Massive Winter Storm</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1948308-accumulating-questions-whats-a-blizzard-is-this-el-nino/\">Accumulating Questions: What&#8217;s a Blizzard?

They used the real-time hurricane analysis and prediction system that Zhang and his team have been developing and refining for nearly a decade.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hurricane prediction models work by chunking individual blocks of the hurricane and this starts from the initial information that is fed into the model,&#8221; says Zhang. &#8220;We then run an ensemble of possible outcomes for the hurricane using different variables to estimate uncertainty and this tells us how the hurricane might behave. If we are able to use a higher resolution for the initial state, this could allow us to vastly improve hurricane predictions in the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GOES-13 provides data at a resolution of 2.5 miles, and GOES-R will increase that to under 0.6 miles for some frequencies of brightness temperature. The increase in resolution is especially important because of the size of hurricanes. The eyewall, the layer of clouds surrounding the eye, varies in size but is roughly 6 miles thick. Using GOES-13 brightness temperatures with 2.5-mile resolution, the eyewall is often grouped together with other parts of the storm, with only one or two brightness temperature measurements from only the eyewall itself.</p>\n<p>A 0.6-mile resolution brightness temperature measurement would allow for up to 10 eyewall measurements to be fed into prediction models as separate chunks of information instead of grouped together with other parts of the storm.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1943794-build-a-better-weather-network-new-york-takes-the-dare/\">Build a Better Weather Network?

Researchers know that wind speed and other levels of activity near the eye of the hurricane are linked to future intensity, but actually collecting these data is difficult. Today, NOAA uses airborne reconnaissance to collect data, but this is only possible when the storm is within flying distance. Satellites that constantly monitor the oceans at high spatial and temporal resolution and with many frequencies of brightness temperature, like GOES-R, could remove that constraint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Geostationary satellites are there all the time, which makes them ideal for capturing the initial and evolving states of hurricanes, including the crucial information in the cloudy region of the storm,&#8221; Zhang says. &#8220;Using satellite data more effectively could potentially revolutionize hurricane monitoring and prediction for many years.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>The National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, NASA and the Funai Foundation for Information Technology supported this research.\u00a0This article was originally published by <a href=\"http://news.psu.edu/story/399668/2016/03/24/research/goes-r-satellite-could-provide-better-data-hurricane-prediction\">Penn State</a>.

Google Earth</h2>\n<p>Satellite imagery such as <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/earth/\">Google Earth</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/\">Microsoft&#8217;s Bing</a> and <a href=\"http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/\">Nasa&#8217;s World Wind</a> has made it possible to zoom into even the most remote corners of the globe to locate sites. By helping to spot things like settlement mounds or enclosures, it can help draw attention to places where such sites may be found. Aerial photographs have been used in this way since the 1930s, but these were typically difficult to access. The universal availability of Google Earth has therefore made it a fantastic tool for professional and citizen scientists alike. However there are many pitfalls in interpretation of satellite images that can only be resolved on the ground.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2005419\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/28/image-20151206-29716-9s3mj0.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2005419\" src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/28/image-20151206-29716-9s3mj0-674x520.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the Late Hallstatt princely hillfort, c. 550-450 BC, covered nowadays in dense wood.

We have long labored in manually mapping elusive &#8220;humps and bumps&#8221; often using hachures, a form of representation invented in 1799. Now <a href=\"http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html\">Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology</a> produces detailed three-dimensional maps of the Earth&#8217;s surface in a fraction of the time. In principle working like a table scanner but operated from a plane, laser beams are directed to the ground, while connected to an accurate GPS and an inertia measurement system, generating a point cloud image of the ground surface. One advantage of LIDAR is that it can often see through vegetation, locating sites otherwise obscured by woodland or tropical forests.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2005423\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/28/image-20151204-14451-schq5h.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2005423\" src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/28/image-20151204-14451-schq5h-674x542.jpg\" alt=\"Drone taking aerial images.

Before that, we used a variety of homemade kites, helium balloons and model planes\u2014filling the gap between aerial photographs and images taken from the top of Landrovers and shaky ladders. Drones can take photographs in low light and in frost and snow conditions when the archaeology can better visualized. One particular application is to mimic LIDAR, by taking overlapping vertical images, and with ground control (typically paper plates at fixed points) it is possible to generate three-dimensional point cloud imagery, using standard software packages. In the not too distant future it will be possible to mount LIDAR directly onto drones.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2004476-from-stonehenge-to-nefertiti-how-high-tech-archaeology-is-transforming-our-view-of-history/\">From Stonehenge to Nefertiti: How High-Tech Archaeology Is Transforming Our View of History</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1350628-4000-year-old-ancient-babylonian-tablet-is-oldest-customer-service-complaint-ever-discovered/\">4,000-Year-Old Ancient Babylonian Tablet Is Oldest Customer Service Complaint Ever Discovered</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<h2>4.

(Tapatio/wikimedia, CC BY-SA)</p></div>\n<p>Geophysical techniques can help locate targets to investigate. <a href=\"https://www.ipfw.edu/centers/archaeology/Geophysics/resistivity.html\">Soil resistivity</a> for example is a measure of how much the soil resists the flow of electricity. It can uncover differences in soil moisture to reveal buried structures and can reliably range up to around 1.5 meters in depth. However it is slow, as probes have to be inserted into the ground at regular intervals, but it can produce highly detailed results. <a href=\"http://www.archaeological-surveys.co.uk/subpage1/index.html\">Magnetometery</a> measures the intensity of the earth&#8217;s magnetic field. This can reflect the pattern of archaeological features created through either burning, or by soil bacteria that can leave magnetic traces in the soil. It is a fast technique, and has proven especially good for desert sites, such as in ancient Egypt. Recently, sensitive magnetometers with multiple sensors, mounted on a cart and linked to GPS, are capable of surveying many hectares in real-time a day and revealing entire landscapes, <a href=\"http://lbi-archpro.org/cs/stonehenge/surveys.html\">such as those around Stonehenge</a>.</p>\n<h2>5. Soil Geochemistry</h2>\n<p>Traces of feces from both humans and animals around ancient settlements can stay in the soil for millennia. It has long been known that by recording patterns of heavy metals in the soil, it may be possible to locate these ancient sites. This is especially important if there are little or no artifacts left behind. One way to carry out such measurements is by collecting samples and analyzing them in the lab. But in the last few years, portable <a href=\"https://www.bruker.com/products/x-ray-diffraction-and-elemental-analysis/handheld-xrf/applications/handheld-xrf-analyzers.html?gclid=Cj0KEQiA-ZSzBRDp3ITHm5KO_JYBEiQA1JjHHN4p7KORQBeteS8MZC3D6eLulI4Xu3M0Bf0EZ9siqIgaAjMd8P8HAQ\">X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurers</a> (pXRF) have become available, enabling rapid in-the-field recording of samples. They work by emitting X-rays that the atoms of the sample absorb. This boosts the energy of the atoms, which in response emit secondary x-rays at a unique energy that reveals the elements the sample is made of.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1993623-scans-and-dna-tests-reveal-the-secrets-of-a-rare-african-mummy/\">Scans and DNA Tests Reveal the Secrets of a Rare African Mummy</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1940654-robber-returns-stolen-archaeological-artifacts-leaves-note-they-have-brought-me-nothing-but-trouble/\">Robber Returns Stolen Archaeological Artifacts, Leaves Note: &#8216;They have brought me nothing but trouble&#8217;</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<h2>6.

But while the technology gradually improved, archaeologists were not impressed. The early use of such radar produced sections through the deposits. However, there were endless cases of false positives. Recently, software has come to the rescue of the technology, by allowing three-dimensional modeling, making visualization much more reliable. One advantage of ground penetrating radar is that it works in confined spaces and through hard surfaces. But interpreting the results remains a problem.

It has decreased the U.K.&#8217;s dependence on fossil fuels such as gas, coal, and oil, which are in limited supply. And nuclear is a much more reliable energy source\u2014for the same amount of fuel, nuclear produces much more energy than its carbon-based counterparts. And, as well as being cost effective, it also produces little waste.</p>\n<p>The chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, now wants the U.K. to be a &#8220;global leader in innovative nuclear technologies.&#8221; Part of this plan involves <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/small-modular-reactors\">spending 250 million pounds</a>\u00a0($353.3 million)\u00a0on a research and development program to put the U.K. in with a chance of &#8220;winning&#8221; the race to develop <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/12017695/UK-plans-small-modular-nuclear-reactor-in-2020s.html\">small modular reactors</a> (SMR).</p>\n<p>In the recent Budget, Osborne launched a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/small-modular-reactors-competition-phase-one\">competition</a> for the &#8220;best value&#8221; design of small modular reactors for use in the U.K. The government has also said it plans to publish a small modular reactor delivery &#8220;roadmap&#8221; later this year and will allocate at least 30 million pounds ($42.4 million) for an <a href=\"https://www.energylivenews.com/2016/03/22/1-5m-awarded-for-nuclear-waste-disposal-research/\">advanced manufacturing program</a>\u00a0to develop nuclear skills.</p>\n<p>All of which will pave the way towards <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-and-autumn-statement-2015-documents/spending-review-and-autumn-statement-2015\">building</a> one of the world&#8217;s first small modular reactors in the U.K. in the 2020s.</p>\n<p>Given the amount of investment, it&#8217;s clear SMRs are big business for government\u2014and for good reason: experts suggest that small nuclear reactors may be <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/small-nuclear-reactors-may-be-the-key-to-a-low-carbon-future-28994\">the key</a> to a low-carbon future.</p>\n<h2>What Are Small Modular Reactors?</h2>\n<p>Small modular reactors are essentially scaled down versions of full-sized nuclear reactors. They are defined by the <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/\">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> as having a power output of up to 300MW\u2014which is enough to power around 428,000 700-watt washing machines. This compares to a full sized nuclear power reactor which boast around 1,000MW\u2014more than three times as much.</p>\n<p>Each person in the U.K.\u00a0<a href=\"http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/average-household-electricity-consumption\">uses an average of 226 Watts</a> throughout the year, and a <a href=\"http://www.westinghousenuclear.com/New-Plants/Small-Modular-Reactor\">typical SMR</a> can theoretically produce enough power for roughly 1 million people using 226 Watts.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1945828-new-technology-could-threaten-human-survival-says-stephen-hawking/\">New Technology Could Threaten Human Survival, Says Stephen Hawking</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1928640-the-life-and-death-of-king-coal/\">The Life and Death of King Coal</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>Compare this to the <a href=\"http://www.4coffshore.com/windfarms/turbine-mhi-vestas-offshore-wind-v164-8.0-mw-tid89.html\">largest</a> commercially available wind turbine installed in Denmark which usually runs at 26 percent of capacity. This equates to supplying 9,203 people\u2014making the difference in output huge.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the size scale, the new nuclear power station which will be built at <a href=\"https://www.edfenergy.com/energy/nuclear-new-build-projects/hinkley-point-c\">Hinkley point C</a> over the next decade or so will have a capacity of 3,200MW\u2014which will be able to provide energy for more than 14 million people, more than ten times the power of any SMR. But what SMRs lack in size and output they make up for in accessibility and the small amount of time it takes to build them.</p>\n<h2>Why Should We Use Them?</h2>\n<p>The main benefit of SMRs compared to full-sized reactors is probably financial\u2014the capital start-up costs are <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421200093X\">far lower</a>, reducing the cost risk for any interested builder.</p>\n<p>Another advantage over full-sized reactors is that most countries are better equipped for smaller power loads than bigger ones\u2014the national electricity grid of some countries cannot handle the huge power load from a full-sized power station\u2014they would simply overload and shut down\u2014so SMRs would be ideal in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>The modular design of the SMRs also ensures they can be manufactured and assembled at a central factory then sent to their new location where they can be installed relatively easily. This is particularly useful in remote locations which might not have the best manufacturing facilities.</p>\n<p>SMRs also have <a href=\"http://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v072n03p093.pdf\">good safety features</a> including a natural cooling feature which comes via an underground cooling mechanism. This can continue to function without external power because the primary coolant system uses <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149197015000050\">natural circulation</a> so there are no pumps required\u2014making it an ideal safety feature against <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-energy-primer/\">core meltdown</a>\u2014which was the problem in Japan when the 2011 tsunami hit.</p>\n<p>Then there is also the advantage of being able to locate the reactor underground, providing more security and protection from natural hazards, such as high winds.</p>\n<h2>What About the Disadvantages?</h2>\n<p>The obvious drawback is the increased running costs\u2014each kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity from an SMR would be expected to cost between <a href=\"http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=45669\">15 percent and 70 percent more</a> than a kWh of electricity produced in a full-sized nuclear power station, due to economies of scale. This means power output decreases while other costs stay constant.</p>\n<p>There are also the usual public fears surrounding nuclear power generation and nuclear waste\u2014which can make SMRs a hard sell, although some of the designs use a &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.energy.gov/ne/nuclear-reactor-technologies/small-modular-nuclear-reactors\">breeder facility</a>,&#8221; which helps to reduce the waste output. Design features such as this combined with an increase in knowledge surrounding SMRs should help to avert public fears over safety.</p>\n<p><div class=\"morearticles\"><strong>MORE:</strong><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1937791-the-geopolitics-of-cheap-oil/\">The Geopolitics of Cheap Oil</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1876430-nuclear-power-plants-in-the-age-of-cyber-terrorism/\">Nuclear Power Plants in the Age of Cyberterrorism</a></strong></li></ul></div></p>\n<p>There are already a number of SMRs in operation around the world including in <a href=\"https://www.uxc.com/smr/uxc_SMRDetail.aspx?key=Indian%20220%20MWe%20PHWR\">India</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uxc.com/smr/uxc_SMRDetail.aspx?key=CNP-300\">China</a>. There are also numerous other SMRs in various states of completion too, from the <a href=\"http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=13250\">35 MWe KLT-40s</a> which is under construction in Russia, to the <a href=\"http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org/2014/11/13/the-uks-forgotten-molten-salt-reactor-programme/\">Molten salt-based reactor</a> still in the design stage in the U.K.</p>\n<p>The government&#8217;s SMR competition is a great step forward in taking things closer to development. Once funding has been allocated to a preferred design then there&#8217;s just a small matter of building one. So while the use of SMRs may be one step closer, it is still going to be some time before these smaller nuclear reactors are in widespread use across the U.K.</p>\n<p><em>Stephen Monk is a\u00a0lecturer at\u00a0Lancaster University in the U.K.\u00a0This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mini-nuclear-reactors-56647\">The Conversation</a>.</em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2004443-everything-you-need-to-know-about-mini-nuclear-reactors/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Boom Plans to Offer &#8216;Affordable&#8217; Supersonic Flights</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2002432-boom-plans-to-offer-affordable-supersonic-flights/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2002432-boom-plans-to-offer-affordable-supersonic-flights/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2016 19:02:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/author/denisse-moreno/\" rel=\"author\">Denisse Moreno</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/\" title=\"Epoch Times\" rel=\"publisher\">Epoch Times</a>]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Amazon]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NASA]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Silicon Valley]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[startup]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Virgin Galactic]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/?p=2002432</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>A Colorado-based startup wants to bring cheap, supersonic flights\u00a0for your business meetings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The startup called Boom is headed by Blake Scholl, a pilot and technology entrepreneur who has worked for Amazon and founded Kima Labs, which was acquired by \u2026</p>]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width=\"674\" height=\"379\" src=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/themes/the-epoch-times-3/images/white.png\"  data-src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/24/Boom-Flying.jpg\" class=\"lazy attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"(Courtesy: Boom)\" srcset=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/24/Boom-Flying-580x326.jpg 580w, http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/24/Boom-Flying.jpg 674w, http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/24/Boom-Flying-512x288.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /><noscript><img width=\"674\" height=\"379\" src=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/24/Boom-Flying.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"(Courtesy: Boom)\" srcset=\"http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/24/Boom-Flying-580x326.jpg 580w, http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/24/Boom-Flying.jpg 674w, http://img.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2016/03/24/Boom-Flying-512x288.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /></noscript><p>A Colorado-based startup wants to bring cheap, supersonic flights\u00a0for your business meetings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The startup called Boom is headed by Blake Scholl, a pilot and technology entrepreneur who has worked for Amazon and founded Kima Labs, which was acquired by Groupon.</p>\n<p>Boom announced\u00a0via Twitter on March 23 that they are partnering with Virgin and it&#8217;s Virgin Galactic space division to build the supersonic aircrafts.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Today we&#8217;re partnering with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Virgin\">@Virgin</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/virgingalactic\">@VirginGalactic</a> to build and fly supersonic aircraft <a href=\"https://t.co/NCfqAMhTNa\">https://t.co/NCfqAMhTNa</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Boom Technology (@boomaero) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boomaero/status/712703114646675456\">March 23, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&#8220;We can confirm that The Spaceship Company will provide engineering, design and manufacturing services, flight tests and operations, and that we have an option on the first 10 airframes.
