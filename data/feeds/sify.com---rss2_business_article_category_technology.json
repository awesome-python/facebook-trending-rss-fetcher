They cited robots operating trucks in some Australian mines; corporate litigation software replacing employees with advanced degrees who used to sift through thousands of documents prior to trials; and on Wall Street, the automation of jobs previously done by bankers with MBAs or PhDs.<br><br>\"Anyone whose job is moving data from one spreadsheet to another ..., that's what is going to get automated,\" said Daniel Nadler, chief executive of Kensho, a financial services analytics company partly owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.<br><br>\"Goldman Sachs will be in here in 10 years, JPMorgan will be here. They're just going to be much more efficient in terms of operating leverage and headcount,\" he added.<br><br>Big banks have slashed tens of thousands of jobs in recent years as businesses like bond trading have become less profitable. Under tremendous pressure from investors to boost profits, but unable to grow revenue much, banks have increasingly turned to technology to reduce costs.<br><br>A Citigroup Inc report in March suggested that more pain is on the way for financial industry staff. Citi's analysts predicted a 30 percent drop in banking jobs across the United States and Europe over the next decade.<br><br>Milken panelists noted technology's impact on work far beyond Wall Street.<br><br>Martin Ford, an author and entrepreneur, argued that while the so-called gig economy has created temporary jobs for independent contractors, the next step is to get rid of them.

The reason for the order was not made public.<br><br>The suspension of WhatsApp's text message and Internet voice telephone service for smartphones was lifted after about 24 hours when an appeals judge on Tuesday ruled in favour of an injunction by the company's lawyers, the court said in a statement. Some 100 million users were affected.<br><br>\"You and your friends can help make sure this never happens again, and I hope you get involved,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook. He also posted a link to a petition, calling efforts to block communication \"very scary in a democracy.\"<br><br>The suspension highlighted growing international tensions between technology companies' privacy concerns and national authorities' efforts to use social media to gain information on possible criminal activities.<br><br>The same judge in Sergipe ordered the imprisonment of a Brazil-based Facebook executive in March in a dispute over demands to access the company's encrypted messaging service as part of a drug trafficking investigation.<br><br>California-based WhatsApp had said in a statement on Monday that it was \"disappointed\" at the judge's decision to suspend its services. It said it had done the utmost to cooperate with Brazilian tribunals, but it did not possess the information the court was requesting.<br><br>Matt Steinfeld, a Facebook spokesman, said WhatsApp executives were meeting this week with law enforcement and judicial officials in Brazil to improve communication and clarify that the company cannot see users' encrypted messages and does not store them after transmission.<br><br><b>BRAZILIANS ANGERED</b><br><br>It was the second time in five months that WhatsApp in Brazil has been suspended. A S\u00e3o Paulo state judge ordered it shut down for 48 hours on Dec. 15, after Facebook failed to comply with an order. Another court lifted that suspension shortly afterward.<br><br>Monday's suspension angered many in Brazil, where the service is used by individuals, companies and federal and local governments to send messages and share pictures and videos. Cost-conscious Brazilians are avid users of free messaging apps, and WhatsApp is by far the most popular - installed on more than 90 percent of Android devices.<br><br>As some Brazilians sought an alternative messaging system, rival Telegram said on Monday that it suffered technical problems under the weight of demand. It said it received more than a million new user requests.<br><br>Let\u00edcia Mendes, a 20-year-old shop assistant in Rio de Janeiro, said she was frustrated by the suspension because it could force people to use pay services.<br><br>\"It's really bad,\" she told Reuters. \"It's just a way of getting more money out of us, when we already have to pay for so many things.\"<br><br>The suspension came as a congressional commission on cyber crime in Brazil debated changes to the 2014 legislation governing the use of the Internet.<br><br>Lower house deputy Esperidi\u00e3o Amin, the rapporteur of the commission, said his proposed reform would help avoid shutdowns of this kind by allowing the blocking of specific individuals or IP addresses suspected of illicit activity, rather than the access of all users.<br><br>\"It's less dramatic than withdrawing the service from the whole of the Brazilian population,\" he told Reuters by telephone.<br>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/facebook-ceo-urges-brazilians-to-decry-whatsapp-block-news-telecom-qfeaeegcgagii.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/google-fiat-chrysler-to-partner-on-self-driving-minivans-news-auto-qfecx9ahcjjfc.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Tue, 03 May 2016 22:52:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Google, Fiat Chrysler to partner on self-driving minivans]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qfekKBgfcjhee.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[Alphabet Inc's Google unit and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have agreed to work together to build a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans in the most advanced collaboration to date between Silicon Valley and a traditional carmaker, the companies said Tuesday.<br><br>The deal marks the first time that Google has worked directly with an automaker \"to integrate its self-driving system, including its sensors and software, into a passenger vehicle,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.<br><br>Google and Fiat Chrysler engineers will work together to fit Google's autonomous driving technology into the Pacifica minivan. Some engineers for both companies will work together at a facility in Southeast Michigan, where Fiat Chrysler has its major North American engineering centre, the companies said.<br><br>Google said it is not sharing proprietary self-driving vehicle technology with Fiat Chrysler, however, and the vehicles will not be offered for sale to the public.<br><br>The agreement between Google and Fiat Chrysler comes as rival technology and auto companies are accelerating efforts to master the complex hardware and artificial intelligence systems required to allow vehicles to pilot themselves.<br><br>General Motors Co in March agreed to acquire San Francisco self-driving car startup Cruise Automation . German automakers Daimler AG , BMW AG and Volkswagen AG last year bought digital mapping company HERE to accelerate their autonomous driving development. Some features already available on mass market cars, SUVs and trucks take steps in the direction of replacing a human driver, such as automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and automatic lane-keeping.<br><br>Some analysts said a self-driving minivan would make sense for testing the technology in a fleet of mass transit vehicles deployed in a controlled environment, such as a Google or Fiat Chrysler campus or a city centre.<br><br>\"Minivans fit into the transportation fleets easily,\" said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \"They can be a box-on-wheels and can move more humans around.\"<br><br>Google's self-driving car engineers had previously purchased Lexus sport utility vehicles made by Toyota Motor Corp and retrofitted sensors and other hardware into the cars on their own.<br><br>Tuesday's deal holds benefits for both companies. Fiat Chrysler has a net debt pile of 6.6 billion euros ($7.6 billion). Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne has been trying unsuccessfully for more than a year to convince reluctant rivals, including GM, to consider a merger to spread the rising costs of advanced safety and emissions technology.<br><br>Fiat Chrysler shares rose more than 2 percent in after market trading after the Google agreement was announced.<br><br>Google has said that it does not want to build self-driving vehicles on its own and has explored alliances with auto companies, but none have been finalised. Working more closely with Fiat Chrysler could help Google refine its systems as a step towards offering them in regular production cars.<br><br>The deal does not preclude either FCA or Google from cooperating with others, the companies said in their statement.<br><br>\"The opportunity to work closely with FCA engineers will accelerate our efforts to develop a fully self-driving car that will make our roads safer and bring everyday destinations within reach for those who cannot drive,\" John Krafcik, chief executive of the Google Self-Driving Car Project, said in a statement.<br><br>Collaborating with Google provides an opportunity for Fiat Chrysler \"to partner with one of the world's leading technology companies to accelerate the pace of innovation in the automotive industry,\" Marchionne said in a separate statement.<br><br>The Fiat Chrysler vehicles will more than double Google's testing fleet, which currently includes about 70 Lexus SUVs and small prototype cars designed by Google. Google is now testing self-driving vehicles in four U.S. cities.<br><br>Executives at other automakers, including GM, Ford Motor and Daimler , have expressed wariness about alliances with Alphabet or other technology companies that could relegate them to the role of hardware suppliers.<br><br>John Elkann, Fiat Chrysler's chairman, in April dismissed the idea that automakers must shoulder alone the burdens of heavy investments in automated driving or ride sharing. By 2030, Elkann said, fully self-driving cars will likely account for just 15 percent of global sales.<br><br>\"Boring old car makers need to figure out how to make this profitable and guard against falling into the ... trap of ignoring that business while chasing profits in other parts of the value chain,\" Elkann said.<br>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/google-fiat-chrysler-to-partner-on-self-driving-minivans-news-auto-qfecx9ahcjjfc.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/google-acquires-start-up-founded-by-indian-origin-entrepreneur-news-news-qfdsnifhafadg.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Tue, 03 May 2016 18:13:08 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Google acquires start-up founded by Indian-origin entrepreneur]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qbxexsedaaicf.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<p>Google has acquired a business technology start-up founded by an Indian-origin entrepreneur as part of its plans to scale training offerings for Google Apps to its customers and customers\u2019 users.</p><p>Varun Malhotra is the founder and CEO of Toronto-based Synergyse, which was launched in 2013 with an aim to teach users how to use Google Apps.</p><p>Google did not disclose the financial details of the deal. </p><p>Google Apps Operations Senior Director Peter Scocimara said in a blog post on Monday that Google and its thousands of Google Apps customers have been \"excited\" about Synergyse.</p><p>The Google Apps product suite, which includes Gmail, Calendar, Drive and Docs, was built to provide cloud-based productivity and communications and is now used by more than two million paying businesses around the world, Scocimara said.</p><p>\"As more businesses sign up, we wanted an elegant way to scale our training offerings to our customers and our customers\u2019 users,\" he said adding that Synergyse builts a virtual coach inside of the Google Apps interface.

The question is, how are they dealt with,\" said Jesper Koll, CEO of fund manager WisdomTree Japan. \"Sweeping them under the carpet is no longer an option.\"</p>  <p/>  <p>GAPS AND GLIMMERS</p>  <p>Experts also warn against wholesale adoption of a U.S. model tying executive compensation to short-term investor returns. Some caution against at pointing the finger just at Japan, given scandals around the world, including Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> cheating on emissions. </p>  <p>\"If you start looking around the world, Japan has its problems, but are they really any worse than anywhere else?\" said Andrew DeWit, a professor of policy studies at Rikkyo University in Tokyo.</p>  <p>Still, big gaps remain to be filled in Japan.</p>  <p>\"At the level of policy, it is dramatic, but the content is underwhelming,\" Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Hong-Kong based Asian Corporate Governance Association, told Reuters.</p>  <p>Requiring two outside directors - Toshiba had four on its 16-member board even as the scandal brewed - is insufficient if they lack they lack the authority or independence to challenge the CEO and other inside directors.</p>  <p>\"Most outside directors won't feel they ought to be questioning the corporate culture. They were invited to the board and they feel they ought to be polite,\" said Nicholas Benes, representative director of the Board Director Training Institute of Japan.</p>  <p>Better protection for whistleblowers like Woodford would help. The government has a hotline for anonymous complaints but provides little protection or incentive for employees to speak out. Bolstering such protection would tell companies they have no alternative than to run a clean ship, Benes said.</p>  <p>Glimmers of change have emerged.</p>  <p>Retail group Seven & i <3382.T> named an executive backed by U.S. activist investor Daniel Loeb as president of its parent company earlier this month, prompting its 83-year-old patriarch Toshifumi Suzuki to resign. </p>  <p>Battered Sharp Corp's <6753.T> recent choice of Taiwan's Foxconn as its successful takeover suitor may also reflect the drive for better corporate governance.</p>  <p>Still, broader and deeper change will take time, bolder reforms and education at all corporate levels, as well as among institutional investors often wary of challenging management.</p>  <p>\"It is a cultural issue \u2013 they have to give up hierarchical obedience,\" said University of Technology's Clarke. \"They have to do this because if they cannot be more alert and agile as companies, they will not succeed in the modern world.\"</p>  <p/>  <p> (Additional reporting by Stanley White and Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Lincoln Feast)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/secrecy-hierarchy-haunt-japan-corporate-culture-despite-abes-reforms-news-others-qfdfbEffgggjg.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/india-to-monitor-mines-via-satellite-after-finding-illegal-limestone-extraction-news-industry-qfcpc4cagfdfd.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Mon, 02 May 2016 09:32:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[India to monitor mines via satellite after finding illegal limestone extraction]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qfcpc3hibefij.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[India will monitor thousands of mines with the help of satellites starting this year, a government official said, after a three-month pilot project found rampant illegal extraction of limestone in a big state.<br><br>Mines Secretary Balvinder Kumar declined to name the state ahead of the completion of surveillance in some other regions, but said the findings echoed a multi-billion-dollar iron ore scam that led to a three-year mining ban and turned India into an importer from a net exporter of the steelmaking commodity.<br><br>Local media have reported about illegal limestone mining in two of the top producing states - Andhra Pradesh in the south and Gujarat in the west, home to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.<br><br>The state-run Indian Bureau of Mines is digitising maps of all mines under the purview of the ministry to check - as satellites pass over every 23 days - whether companies are violating rules by mining outside their lease areas.<br><br>\"We suspect that there is rampant illegal mining by the unorganised sector,\" Kumar told Reuters late last week.<br><br>\"After covering all the major minerals like iron ore and limestone in the next three months, we will look at sand mining.

The firm said inventory levels remain low for the new models, suggesting good momentum.  </p>  <p>\"In the second quarter we expect our solid performance to continue,\" Samsung investor relations chief Robert Yi said during a post-earnings conference call, adding the firm was \"cautiously optimistic\" that operating profit would increase quarter-on-quarter.</p>  <p>Samsung's January-March operating profit was 6.7 trillion won ($5.84 billion), slightly above with its earlier estimate of 6.6 trillion won. Revenue rose 5.7 percent to 49.8 trillion won, compared with its guidance for 49 trillion won. </p>  <p>Profit for the smartphone division jumped 42 percent from a year earlier to 3.9 trillion won, an almost two-year high. Samsung said it expected further sales growth for its Galaxy S7 devices in the second quarter as well as from its mid-to-low tier products, flagging improved profitability on lower-end models such as the Galaxy A and J series.</p>  <p>The firm expects second-quarter mobile shipments, including non-smartphones, to fall slightly from 92 million units in January-March, partly as older smartphone models are phased out. Average sales prices will rise slightly, however. </p>  <p>Market researcher TrendForce says combined shipments for flat- and curved-screen S7 models will reach 52 million by the year-end, surpassing the previous record of 47 million sets by the Galaxy S4. </p>  <p>Operating profit for the chip division fell 6 percent to 2.6 trillion won, undercut by price declines for memory chips stemming from slower demand for products such as personal computers.</p>  <p>The firm also said it will buy back and cancel 2 trillion won of its own shares in the third instalment of its 11.3 trillion won buyback plan. </p>  <p>Yi said during the conference call Samsung did not plan to implement quarterly dividends in 2016. </p>  <p/>  <p>($1 = 1,146.9900 won)</p>  <p/>  <p> (Reporting by Se Young Lee;

Facebook will issue two of the so-called \"Class C\" shares for each outstanding Class A and Class B share held by shareholders. Those new Class C shares will be publicly traded under a new symbol.</p>  <p>So, for example, someone who held a single Class A share at Wednesday's closing price of $108.76 would end up instead with one Class A share and two Class C shares, each of which would be priced at $36.25.</p>  <p>\"Since the Class C shares would have the same economic rights as the Class A and Class B shares, we would expect that after the payment of the stock dividend, the share price of the Class A common stock would generally reflect a three for one stock split,\" Facebook Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said on a conference call.</p>  <p>The plan must be approved by Facebook's shareholders at a meeting on June 20, but since Zuckerberg controls the company, its success is virtually certain.
