That&#8217;s less than President Barack Obama&#8217;s $1.9 billion request, which has upset some senior Democrats.</p>\n<p>Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., told reporters that she still prefers Obama&#8217;s proposal but has reached agreement with Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., on the smaller measure, which is likely to be added next week to a bill funding veterans and transportation programs. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., immediately set up a floor vote on the measure for next week.</p>\n<p>The administration requested emergency funding to battle Zika in February but Republicans controlling Congress have been slow to react, and instead forced the administration last month to tap more than $500 million worth of unspent Ebola funding to battle Zika. The compromise measure fails to restore most of that money.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have pushed for the $1.9 (billion) since the beginning. I think it&#8217;s the right package,&#8221; Murray said. &#8220;But I have reached an agreement with Blunt on what we can put into a package, and we&#8217;ll have a vote on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The White House was heartened by the development. &#8220;Frankly, at this point, given the delays and given the heightened stakes, we welcome any sort of forward momentum in Congress,&#8221; said press secretary Josh Earnest.</p>\n<p>But top Senate Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada gave the proposal a frosty reception, saying it is &#8220;not enough, especially when the amount will likely be reduced further by House Republicans.&#8221; Reid and Democrats unhappy with the plan could try to block it, but there&#8217;s no obvious way to pass something more generous.</p>\n<p>The Zika virus can cause microcephaly, a severe birth defect. Babies born with the conditions have abnormally small heads. Zika virus is spread by mosquitoes and sexual contact and is likely to spread more widely during mosquito season. Polls show that the public isn&#8217;t anywhere nearly as scared of Zika as it was about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the handful of cases in the U.S. in 2014, but Zika awareness and anxiety is likely to grow as mosquito season heats up.</p>\n<p>Aides to both Democrats and Republicans said the Blunt-Murray proposal is likely to pass easily in the Senate, though Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., are demanding a vote on the full $1.9 billion administration request. No. 2 Sen. Republican John Cornyn of Texas is likely to offer an alternative that is financed with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. Both of those plans are likely to fall to filibusters, however, leaving the Blunt-Murray compromise as the only option.</p>\n<p>Roughly one-third of the compromise proposal, $361 million, would go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for domestic Zika response such as mosquito control and rapid response teams. Another $200 million would be used by the National Institutes of Health for vaccine research and other purposes. And another $248 million would battle the virus overseas.</p>\n<p>The Senate move is likely to set up a conflict with the House, where GOP leaders are likely to press for a much smaller amount and pay for it by cutting other programs or using leftover Ebola money that was passed at the end of 2014.</p>\n<p>Across the Capitol, at a hearing called by House Democrats, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health acknowledged, &#8220;It is very difficult to get people to invest in something that hasn&#8217;t happened yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Federal health officials are not predicting widespread outbreaks of Zika in the continental United States.

I&#8217;m Judy Woodruff.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: And I&#8217;m Hari Sreenivasan.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: On the &#8220;NewsHour&#8221; tonight:</p>\n<p><strong>REP. PAUL RYAN</strong> (R-WI), Speaker of the House: We talked about what it takes to unify, where our differences were and how we can bridge these gaps.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: In a bid for party unity, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other top Republican leaders meet with Donald Trump.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Also ahead this Thursday: Brazil&#8217;s unpopular President Dilma Rousseff is suspended and could be removed from office, in the wake of economic and political turmoil.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: And we head to Puerto Rico, where the island battles to contain an outbreak of Zika virus.</p>\n<p><strong>AMARILYS ALVAREZ SANCHEZ</strong>, WIC Puerto Rico\u00a0(through interpreter): There is a lack of understanding in sexual relations, and that the virus can be transmitted from the father to the mother. Women will laugh and say they&#8217;re already pregnant, but they don&#8217;t realize the need for condoms.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: All that and more on tonight&#8217;s &#8220;PBS NewsHour.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(BREAK)</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: In the day&#8217;s other news: A federal judge in Washington struck down federal spending to subsidize health care for low-income Americans. It comes to $175 billion over a decade. House Republicans argued the Obama administration is spending the money without congressional approval, and the judge agreed. The White House plans an appeal.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: Islamic State suicide bombers struck again in Iraq today, just a day after killing nearly 100 people in Baghdad. This time, they blew up two truck bombs in the recently liberated city of Ramadi; 17 Iraqi solders were killed.</p>\n<p>Back in Baghdad, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi visited victims of yesterday&#8217;s attacks. And two more bombings in the city killed five people today.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: In Syria, a cease-fire expired in Aleppo, and fighting flared north of the city. Government forces battled rebels for control of a district just north of the city. It sits on the supply route to rebel-held portions of Aleppo.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: The United States powered up an $800 million missile shield in Romania today, drawing the ire of Russia. The site has been in the works for years to stave off potential ballistic missiles fired toward Europe. U.S. and NATO officials attended today&#8217;s ceremony at the remote Romanian site.</p>\n<p>Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work insisted the focus is on Iran, and not Moscow.</p>\n<p><strong>ROBERT WORK</strong>, Deputy Secretary of Defense: It was never, ever about Russia. We have offered to the Russians to show them the technical specs. We have done everything we can to try to make sure that they understand the capability of the system and why it doesn&#8217;t pose any type of a threat to their strategic deterrence.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: Even so, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official called the shield part of &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;the military and political containment of Russia.&#8221; He said the move will hurt efforts to repair ties with NATO.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Turkey lashed out at the European Union today over letting Turks travel within the E.U. without visas. It&#8217;s part of an agreement to curb the flow of migrants. But the E.U. says the deal also calls for Turkey to reform its terrorism laws, and not to target journalists and political opponents.</p>\n<p>In Ankara today, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that issue is an internal matter.</p>\n<p><strong>PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN</strong>, Turkey (through interpreter): You see the E.U.&#8217;s attitude. What is it? The E.U. says we should soften our stance in fight against terrorism and against terror organizations. Since when have you, the E.U., started to govern Turkey?</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Since the migrant deal took effect, the numbers crossing from Turkey have fallen dramatically.

I&#8217;m Judy Woodruff.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: And I&#8217;m Hari Sreenivasan.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: On the &#8220;NewsHour&#8221; tonight:</p>\n<p><strong>REP. PAUL RYAN</strong> (R-WI), Speaker of the House: We talked about what it takes to unify, where our differences were and how we can bridge these gaps.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: In a bid for party unity, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other top Republican leaders meet with Donald Trump.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Also ahead this Thursday: Brazil&#8217;s unpopular President Dilma Rousseff is suspended and could be removed from office, in the wake of economic and political turmoil.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: And we head to Puerto Rico, where the island battles to contain an outbreak of Zika virus.</p>\n<p><strong>AMARILYS ALVAREZ SANCHEZ</strong>, WIC Puerto Rico\u00a0(through interpreter): There is a lack of understanding in sexual relations, and that the virus can be transmitted from the father to the mother. Women will laugh and say they&#8217;re already pregnant, but they don&#8217;t realize the need for condoms.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: All that and more on tonight&#8217;s &#8220;PBS NewsHour.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(BREAK)</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: In the day&#8217;s other news: A federal judge in Washington struck down federal spending to subsidize health care for low-income Americans. It comes to $175 billion over a decade. House Republicans argued the Obama administration is spending the money without congressional approval, and the judge agreed. The White House plans an appeal.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: Islamic State suicide bombers struck again in Iraq today, just a day after killing nearly 100 people in Baghdad. This time, they blew up two truck bombs in the recently liberated city of Ramadi; 17 Iraqi solders were killed.</p>\n<p>Back in Baghdad, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi visited victims of yesterday&#8217;s attacks. And two more bombings in the city killed five people today.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: In Syria, a cease-fire expired in Aleppo, and fighting flared north of the city. Government forces battled rebels for control of a district just north of the city. It sits on the supply route to rebel-held portions of Aleppo.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: The United States powered up an $800 million missile shield in Romania today, drawing the ire of Russia. The site has been in the works for years to stave off potential ballistic missiles fired toward Europe. U.S. and NATO officials attended today&#8217;s ceremony at the remote Romanian site.</p>\n<p>Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work insisted the focus is on Iran, and not Moscow.</p>\n<p><strong>ROBERT WORK</strong>, Deputy Secretary of Defense: It was never, ever about Russia. We have offered to the Russians to show them the technical specs. We have done everything we can to try to make sure that they understand the capability of the system and why it doesn&#8217;t pose any type of a threat to their strategic deterrence.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: Even so, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official called the shield part of &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;the military and political containment of Russia.&#8221; He said the move will hurt efforts to repair ties with NATO.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Turkey lashed out at the European Union today over letting Turks travel within the E.U. without visas. It&#8217;s part of an agreement to curb the flow of migrants. But the E.U. says the deal also calls for Turkey to reform its terrorism laws, and not to target journalists and political opponents.</p>\n<p>In Ankara today, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that issue is an internal matter.</p>\n<p><strong>PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN</strong>, Turkey (through interpreter): You see the E.U.&#8217;s attitude. What is it? The E.U. says we should soften our stance in fight against terrorism and against terror organizations. Since when have you, the E.U., started to govern Turkey?</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: Since the migrant deal took effect, the numbers crossing from Turkey have fallen dramatically. Still, the E.U. today allowed five member countries to maintain new border controls for another six months.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: The government of Malaysia says two more pieces of debris have been found from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

Although it makes up just a sliver of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, it is far more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere, making it a top target for environmentalists concerned about global warming.</p>\n<p>Officials estimate the rule would cost the industry about $530 million in 2025. Those costs would be outweighed by reduced health care costs and other benefits totaling about $690 million, officials estimate.</p>\n<p>EPA administrator Gina McCarthy said the new rule would &#8220;protect public health and reduce pollution linked to cancer and other serious health effects while allowing industry to continue to grow and provide a vital source of energy for Americans across the country.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With his presidency drawing to a close, Obama has been in a rush to propose and finalize sweeping regulations targeting greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.</p>\n<p>The methane rule follows a landmark regulation Obama finalized last year to cut carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants by 32 percent. The plan, the centerpiece of Obama&#8217;s climate change strategy, has drawn legal challenges from power companies and dozens of Republican-led states.</p>\n<p>Obama also has proposed regulations targeting carbon pollution from airplanes and set new standards to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide pollution from trucks and vans.</p>\n<p>In January, the administration proposed new rules to clamp down on oil companies that burn off or &#8220;flare&#8221; natural gas on public lands, saying it will reduce waste and harmful methane emissions. Between 2009 and 2014, enough natural gas was lost through venting, flaring and leaks to power more than 5 million homes for a year, officials said.</p>\n<p>The president has set a goal to cut overall U.S. emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent over the next decade, as he seeks to leave a legacy of using the full range of his executive power to fight climate change and encouraging other countries to do the same.</p>\n<p>Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group, called methane &#8220;a tremendous threat to our climate&#8221; and said cutting methane pollution &#8220;is the fastest, cheapest path to slow the warming we will otherwise see in the next 20 years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The American Petroleum Institute, the largest lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, said the new rule could harm America&#8217;s &#8220;shale energy revolution&#8221; that has lowered U.S. carbon emissions and lowered costs for American consumers to heat their homes and drive their cars.

It would require energy producers to find and repair leaks at oil and gas wells and capture gas that escapes from wells that use the common drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.<div class='nhlinkbox related-content alignright'><div class='nhlinkbox-head'>RELATED CONTENT</div><div class='nhlinkbox-links'><ul><li><a href='http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/u-s-proposes-rules-to-limit-methane-gas-flaring-at-drilling-sites/'>U.S. proposes rules to limit methane gas 'flaring' at drilling sites</a></li><li class='more'><a href='http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/california-natural-gas-leak-just-one-of-thousands-across-country/'>California natural gas leak just one of thousands across country <i class='fa fa-angle-double-right'></i></a></li></ul></div></div></p>\n<p>Methane, the key component of natural gas, tends to leak during oil and gas production. Although it makes up just a sliver of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, it is far more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere, making it a top target for environmentalists concerned about global warming.</p>\n<p>Officials estimate the rule would cost the industry about $530 million in 2025. Those costs would be outweighed by reduced health care costs and other benefits totaling about $690 million, officials estimate.</p>\n<p>EPA administrator Gina McCarthy said the new rule would &#8220;protect public health and reduce pollution linked to cancer and other serious health effects while allowing industry to continue to grow and provide a vital source of energy for Americans across the country.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With his presidency drawing to a close, Obama has been in a rush to propose and finalize sweeping regulations targeting greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.</p>\n<p>The methane rule follows a landmark regulation Obama finalized last year to cut carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants by 32 percent. The plan, the centerpiece of Obama&#8217;s climate change strategy, has drawn legal challenges from power companies and dozens of Republican-led states.</p>\n<p>Obama also has proposed regulations targeting carbon pollution from airplanes and set new standards to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide pollution from trucks and vans.</p>\n<p>In January, the administration proposed new rules to clamp down on oil companies that burn off or &#8220;flare&#8221; natural gas on public lands, saying it will reduce waste and harmful methane emissions. Between 2009 and 2014, enough natural gas was lost through venting, flaring and leaks to power more than 5 million homes for a year, officials said.</p>\n<p>The president has set a goal to cut overall U.S. emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent over the next decade, as he seeks to leave a legacy of using the full range of his executive power to fight climate change and encouraging other countries to do the same.</p>\n<p>Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group, called methane &#8220;a tremendous threat to our climate&#8221; and said cutting methane pollution &#8220;is the fastest, cheapest path to slow the warming we will otherwise see in the next 20 years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The American Petroleum Institute, the largest lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, said the new rule could harm America&#8217;s &#8220;shale energy revolution&#8221; that has lowered U.S. carbon emissions and lowered costs for American consumers to heat their homes and drive their cars. U.S. oil and gas production has boomed in recent years, driven largely by fracking and other advanced drilling techniques that have made it easier for energy companies to extract oil and gas from sites where production would have been difficult or impossible in the past.</p>\n<p>Even as oil and natural gas production has risen dramatically in recent years, methane emissions have fallen, thanks to new technologies that have reduced waste and improved efficiency.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make sense that the administration would add unreasonable and overly burdensome regulations when the industry is already leading the way in reducing emissions,&#8221; said Kyle Isakower, API vice president of regulatory and economic policy.</p>\n<p>Rachel Richardson, director of the Stop Drilling program for Environment America, another advocacy group, called the new rule a step forward, but said it &#8220;falls short of what&#8217;s needed to avert climate disaster.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Richardson and other advocates said better controls on existing fracking and drilling operations are needed, along with a commitment to phase out fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal in favor of renewable energy such as wind and solar power.</p>\n<p>The EPA said Thursday it is also asking energy companies to provide a range of information on existing drilling wells, including the types of technologies that could be used to reduce methane emissions.

The ride-sharing giant&#8217;s rise has spurred a number of fights across the country.</p>\n<p>The latest move, an agreement to create a drivers association representing about 35,000 drivers in New York City. That follows a recent settlement with drivers in California and Massachusetts, and a decision to suspend service in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p>Mike Isaac covers this landscape for The New York Times, joins us now from San Francisco.</p>\n<p>How significant was this agreement that Uber made in New York?</p>\n<p><strong>MIKE ISAAC</strong>, The New York Times: So, it&#8217;s probably the largest to date that Uber has had in a sort of positive agreement with any sort of recognized labor unions.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the first time that Uber is actually recognizing a group of drivers. They&#8217;re not calling it a union because they lack some really fundamental issues that &#8212; issues and abilities that unions have, which includes the ability to collectively bargain with Uber on pay.</p>\n<p>But, as far as overall significance, it&#8217;s the first time Uber is actually willing on agree to talk to one of these groups.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: So, is this a step to try to prevent unionization or to have to call drivers employees?</p>\n<p><strong>MIKE ISAAC</strong>: You know, it&#8217;s &#8212; Uber has never really had good lines of communication with any of the drivers that work for them.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest complaints has always been, you know, for drivers, that they can&#8217;t get in touch with Uber. If they have been deactivated driving for Uber, they don&#8217;t know why often. It&#8217;s sort of this first olive branch from the company saying, OK, we&#8217;re going to start listening to you and essentially give you a voice.</p>\n<p>Now, that also serves another purpose, to, you know, sort of give a quasi-union-style thing to drivers without actually making them employees, which would cost Uber, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars more in overhead.</p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s kind of a &#8212; it&#8217;s serving more than one purpose at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: OK.</p>\n<p>Now, what are the fights going on in the other parts of the country we mentioned? Right in your home area, in California, what was the settlement there about?</p>\n<p><strong>MIKE ISAAC</strong>: So, in California and in Massachusetts, there was a class-action lawsuit going on where a number of &#8212; tens of thousands of workers were essentially suing Uber to &#8212; for back wages, for overtime, for expenses, essentially things that you would receive if you were a full-time employee.</p>\n<p>Now, Uber, you know, continues to call their drivers their partner &#8212; driver partners and has no real incentive to employ these people. So, that had been going on for a while. But Uber finally settled with the class-action &#8212; or agreed to settle the class-action for up to $100 million and some of the concessions that you&#8217;re seeing in this new union &#8212; union-esque group formed in New York recently.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: I say Uber all the time, but it&#8217;s almost a shorthand for Uber, Lyft, other ride-sharing companies. They just pulled out of Austin.</p>\n<p>It seems the strategy sometimes for these companies is to ask forgiveness, rather than permission. What happened in Austin, and why did they have to leave?</p>\n<p><strong>MIKE ISAAC</strong>: Well, Austin was an interesting battle for them.</p>\n<p>They essentially were going up against the slate legislature over background checks.

The ride-sharing giant&#8217;s rise has spurred a number of fights across the country.</p>\n<p>The latest move, an agreement to create a drivers association representing about 35,000 drivers in New York City. That follows a recent settlement with drivers in California and Massachusetts, and a decision to suspend service in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p>Mike Isaac covers this landscape for The New York Times, joins us now from San Francisco.</p>\n<p>How significant was this agreement that Uber made in New York?</p>\n<p><strong>MIKE ISAAC</strong>, The New York Times: So, it&#8217;s probably the largest to date that Uber has had in a sort of positive agreement with any sort of recognized labor unions.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the first time that Uber is actually recognizing a group of drivers. They&#8217;re not calling it a union because they lack some really fundamental issues that &#8212; issues and abilities that unions have, which includes the ability to collectively bargain with Uber on pay.</p>\n<p>But, as far as overall significance, it&#8217;s the first time Uber is actually willing on agree to talk to one of these groups.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: So, is this a step to try to prevent unionization or to have to call drivers employees?</p>\n<p><strong>MIKE ISAAC</strong>: You know, it&#8217;s &#8212; Uber has never really had good lines of communication with any of the drivers that work for them.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest complaints has always been, you know, for drivers, that they can&#8217;t get in touch with Uber. If they have been deactivated driving for Uber, they don&#8217;t know why often. It&#8217;s sort of this first olive branch from the company saying, OK, we&#8217;re going to start listening to you and essentially give you a voice.</p>\n<p>Now, that also serves another purpose, to, you know, sort of give a quasi-union-style thing to drivers without actually making them employees, which would cost Uber, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars more in overhead.</p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s kind of a &#8212; it&#8217;s serving more than one purpose at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: OK.</p>\n<p>Now, what are the fights going on in the other parts of the country we mentioned? Right in your home area, in California, what was the settlement there about?</p>\n<p><strong>MIKE ISAAC</strong>: So, in California and in Massachusetts, there was a class-action lawsuit going on where a number of &#8212; tens of thousands of workers were essentially suing Uber to &#8212; for back wages, for overtime, for expenses, essentially things that you would receive if you were a full-time employee.</p>\n<p>Now, Uber, you know, continues to call their drivers their partner &#8212; driver partners and has no real incentive to employ these people. So, that had been going on for a while. But Uber finally settled with the class-action &#8212; or agreed to settle the class-action for up to $100 million and some of the concessions that you&#8217;re seeing in this new union &#8212; union-esque group formed in New York recently.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: I say Uber all the time, but it&#8217;s almost a shorthand for Uber, Lyft, other ride-sharing companies. They just pulled out of Austin.</p>\n<p>It seems the strategy sometimes for these companies is to ask forgiveness, rather than permission. What happened in Austin, and why did they have to leave?</p>\n<p><strong>MIKE ISAAC</strong>: Well, Austin was an interesting battle for them.</p>\n<p>They essentially were going up against the slate legislature over background checks. And, basically, Uber has this process where they have an outside company performing these background checks for drivers. They&#8217;re usually turned around in a few days, and drivers can get on the platform and start driving really quickly.</p>\n<p>Now, the point of contention there was, taxi drivers and cab drivers generally have to go through a fingerprint-based background check, which many people believe is much more comprehensive than the type of background checks that Uber is &#8212; Uber and Lyft and other ride-sharing companies are requiring.</p>\n<p>So, Uber spent, I believe it was $9 million fighting that in the state legislature, saying, our background checks very safe.

BLAKE DREMANN</strong>, U.S. Navy: We got invited to the White House, and this is me with the president and the first 24 females on a submarine.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: But by the time that vessel launched in late 2013, Blake was physically transitioning to the male gender, and giving himself weekly hormone injections.</p>\n<p><strong>LT. BLAKE DREMANN</strong>: I took my first shot the week before we got under way, and I took them under way with us.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: Blake is a transgender man. His sex at birth was female, but he&#8217;s long identified himself as male.</p>\n<p><strong>LT. BLAKE DREMANN</strong>: I probably knew when I was like 5, right, that something was amiss. But you grow up in the church, you grow up in Bible college, that type of environment, and you just learn to ignore it.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: Blake is now stationed at the Pentagon. He says most of the other officers treat him like any another colleague.</p>\n<p><strong>LT. BLAKE DREMANN</strong>: The senior officers have been very receptive about it. And I have talked to all kinds of them for sometimes an hour or an hour-and-a-half at a time just kind of answering questions. And if you ask, I&#8217;m very open.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: The tide has slowly been turning for transgender service members like Blake. Until last year, if a soldier, sailor, airman or Marine changed their gender identity, Pentagon policy was to give them a medical disqualification and discharge them from service.</p>\n<p>This was policy, but it wasn&#8217;t always strictly enforced. But last July, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter stopped these dismissals, and ordered the Pentagon to draft plans to allow transgender people to serve openly.</p>\n<p>But that change came too late for some. As a man, Brynn Tannehill graduated with honors from the Naval Academy in 1997. She went on to serve as a Navy pilot for over a decade.</p>\n<p><strong>LT. CMDR. BRYNN TANNEHILL</strong>, U.S. Navy Reserve: I was flying an SH-60B helicopter full of sub hunting gear and surface search radars and infrared cameras. We could carry anti-ship missiles and torpedoes.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: She served in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere. And after leaving the Navy, she joined the Reserves, but she soon realized she couldn&#8217;t keep flying.</p>\n<p><strong>LT. CMDR. BRYNN TANNEHILL</strong>: I left the military in 2010, left the Reserves, because I was dealing with gender dysphoria. I was dealing with the fact that I didn&#8217;t identify with the gender I had been assigned at birth.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: She&#8217;s now a military consultant. In her free time, she makes her own medieval-style body armor and participates in popular one-on-one mock combat.</p>\n<p>Gender dysphoria, according to the current thinking among mental health professionals, is the real deep-seated sense that the gender you were born with isn&#8217;t really who you are. A survey of over 6,000 transgender Americans found that 20 percent &#8212; that&#8217;s one in five &#8212; had served in the military. That&#8217;s more than twice the percentage of the general population.</p>\n<p>Another study, by the UCLA School of Law, estimates that about 15,500 trans people serve in the U.S. armed forces, out of a total force of 1.5 million. The same study found that there are about 130,000 trans veterans, out of 22 million total veterans.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. GEORGE BROWN</strong>, East Tennessee State University: You have to live a double life. You have to live secretly. And there are many problems that arrive out of that type of existence.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: George Brown is associate chairman for veterans affairs at East Tennessee State University. He spent 15 years as an Air Force psychiatrist. Since the 1980s, Dr. Brown has treated hundreds of transgender soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. And he&#8217;s developed a theory about why so many trans men and women serve.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. GEORGE BROWN</strong>: Ninety percent of the people I interviewed would say, you know, when I was 17, 18, 19 years old, I knew there was something different about myself, and I really wanted to run away from this. And I thought, if I joined the military, I could become a real man.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: However trans men and women end up in the military, Brynn Tannehill wants them to be treated the same way that all other federal government workers are treated.</p>\n<p><strong>LT. CMDR. BRYNN TANNEHILL</strong>: The federal work force already has policies in place that allow other federal workers to transition, to change their names, change their gender markers, to use bathrooms, to use locker rooms. All of this has been worked out with every other federal agency.</p>\n<p>So the military is really kind of a little bit behind the curve on this one.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: She says VA hospitals have been providing hormones and therapy to trans veterans since 2011. But that&#8217;s not the case for service members on active duty or in the Reserves. Tannehill says, if a woman needs hormone replacement therapy to address menopausal symptoms or after cancer treatment, she can get it through the military health care system, but not women like her.</p>\n<p><strong>LT. CMDR. BRYNN TANNEHILL</strong>: If a transgender woman needs that same estrogen in the same doses, she can&#8217;t get it.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: According to a recent study in &#8220;The New England Journal of Medicine&#8221; by Aaron Belkin of the Palm Center &#8212; they&#8217;re a research and advocacy group that focuses on transgender issues &#8212; it would cost the military about $5.6 million to pay for hormones and other transition-related treatments annually. According to the same estimate, about 188 soldiers would transition each year.</p>\n<p>While this represents just a sliver of the Pentagon&#8217;s personnel, and its nearly $600 billion annual budget, for retired Marine Colonel Gary Anderson, his concerns about trans service members go beyond just money.</p>\n<p><strong>COL. GARY ANDERSON</strong> (RET.), U.S. Marine Corps: I have nothing personally against women in combat, gays in the military, transsexuals in the military, or gay pregnant whales in the military, as long as somebody can show me that there is value added and not value taken away from the military readiness.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: Anderson says that letting transgender people and gays serve has damaged morale. He claims it&#8217;s the lowest it&#8217;s been in decades. The cause? Changing attitudes about the LGBTQI community.</p>\n<p><strong>COL. GARY ANDERSON</strong>: I think progressive fascism is a fair description. I think we have got people who &#8212; quite frankly, diversity in this particular Pentagon and this particular time frame has become a religion.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: In the past, the Pentagon has said that the impact of letting gays and lesbians serve openly has been &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;negligible.&#8221; They have not yet studied the impact of transgender service members.</p>\n<p>But Anderson also says that transgender service members present logistical challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>COL. GARY ANDERSON</strong>: Will there be a requirement for a third bathing and sanitary facility aboard submarines, on fire bases and so forth?</p>\n<p><strong>LT. BLAKE DREMANN</strong>: We got stalls. We&#8217;re mature enough to not &#8212; you know, you shut the door. Everybody knows. It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s any secret to what going on when you walk into the bathroom.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: According to the Palm Center, 18 countries, including Canada, the U.K. and other NATO allies, have allowed transgender soldiers to serve. And Tannehill says there&#8217;s no evidence those militaries suffered any problems or setbacks.</p>\n<p><strong>LT. CMDR. BRYNN TANNEHILL</strong>: They have dealt with all the same issues that the DOD is looking at, and they dealt with them 15, 16 to 20 years ago, including facilities, including medical care, including nondiscrimination and non &#8212; anti-harassment policies.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: Tannehill and others who watch the issue are expecting Defense Secretary Carter to make an announcement about the Pentagon&#8217;s strategy by midsummer. They hope it will put to rest the uncertainty of serving while transgender.</p>\n<p>For the &#8220;PBS NewsHour,&#8221; I&#8217;m William Brangham.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/transgender-soldiers-gain-ground-as-u-s-military-transitions/\">Transgender soldiers gain ground as U.S. military transitions</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe class='partnerPlayer' frameborder='0' marginwidth='0' marginheight='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' src='http://player.pbs.org/widget/partnerplayer/2365752290/?start=0&end=0&chapterbar=false&endscreen=false' allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN</strong>: It&#8217;s been nearly a year since the secretary of defense declared the military&#8217;s ban on transgender soldiers &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;outdated,&#8221; but the Pentagon has yet to issue any new directives, despite deadlines.</p>\n<p>William Brangham explores what it means to be transgender in the armed forces.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM</strong>: In 2014, Lieutenant Blake Dremann was going to be one of the first women to serve on a U.S. Navy submarine.</p>\n<p><strong>LT.

But it&#8217;s unlikely that their children or grandchildren will experience the same job tenure.</p>\n<p>The survey of more than 1,000 Americans 50 and older by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 41 percent of those employed workers have spent two decades with the same company, including 18 percent who&#8217;ve stayed at least 30 years.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s a trend more common among the older baby boomers than younger ones, and traditional pensions appear to be one of the driving factors.</p>\n<p>Among those who have had at least 20 years with a single employer, the survey found that about half are excited about retirement, but a third are anxious about their post-work lives.</p>\n<p>David McQuinn, 61, is retiring Tuesday after 30 years with MiTek, a construction and engineering firm in suburban St. Louis. He says there were times he thought about leaving but he liked his co-workers and his senior position and also owned stock in the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I started working young and I&#8217;ve been a man in a hurry my whole life,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and now I&#8217;m in a hurry to not be in a hurry.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His experience exemplifies a trait among boomers: more attachment to the company than the younger generations. But even among older Americans there&#8217;s a gap in employment tenure: Half of those aged 65 and up but only a third of those age 50 to 64 have stayed with the same employer for at least two decades.</p>\n<p>The shift may be less about differences in attitude than changes in jobs \u2014 and benefits.</p>\n<p>About two-thirds of those who stayed with one employer for 20 or more years had a pension, according to the survey, compared with only a third of those who had never stayed that long with one employer.</p>\n<p>Those defined benefit pension plans are slowly disappearing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that only 18 percent of private workers were covered by these plans in 2011, down from 35 percent in the early 1990s. More common now are plans like 401(k)s, which are more portable from one employer to another.</p>\n<p>The agency has reported that a larger proportion of older workers than younger workers had more tenure on the job. For example it said, in January 2014, the average tenure with the current employer was 7.9 years for people 45 to 54, compared to 10.4 years for those 55 to 64.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Think of all the choices people have today. I mean, who ever heard of a social-media analyst five years ago?&#8221; says Joe Coughlin, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s AgeLab.</p>\n<p>Coughlin says higher churn in the labor market also means companies will have to work harder to hire and retain the workers they need, and this creates leverage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Millennials think this way instinctively,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve seen their parents laid off by these large corporations, so there is less trust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Christina Guerrero worked in the mid-1980s as a housekeeper at Austin&#8217;s Brackenridge Hospital before applying for and getting a job as a clinical assistant.</p>\n<p>She kept that job for 17 years, before moving to a neighboring children&#8217;s hospital. Lifting children into hospital beds, she recalls, was easier on her back then moving adults.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought about looking for other jobs, but almost any hospital these days would require me to go back to school to finish my GED, so that was a big reason for staying put,&#8221; says Guerrero, now 61.</p>\n<p>According to the AP-NORC survey, younger baby boomers were much more likely to have gone back to school in the past five years: 30 percent of those age 50-64, compared to 19 percent of those 65 and older.</p>\n<p>Most went for additional training because their employer required it or they wanted to learn something new or fun. Only 17 percent said they received training to start a new career.</p>\n<p>Joe Abraham, 65, says he&#8217;s sure he &#8220;dodged a few bullets along the way&#8221; during his 36-year career as an attorney at Ford Motor Co.</p>\n<p>Now retired, he says the raises and benefits he got from Ford were not worth giving up for something else.

Lifting children into hospital beds, she recalls, was easier on her back then moving adults.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought about looking for other jobs, but almost any hospital these days would require me to go back to school to finish my GED, so that was a big reason for staying put,&#8221; says Guerrero, now 61.</p>\n<p>According to the AP-NORC survey, younger baby boomers were much more likely to have gone back to school in the past five years: 30 percent of those age 50-64, compared to 19 percent of those 65 and older.</p>\n<p>Most went for additional training because their employer required it or they wanted to learn something new or fun. Only 17 percent said they received training to start a new career.</p>\n<p>Joe Abraham, 65, says he&#8217;s sure he &#8220;dodged a few bullets along the way&#8221; during his 36-year career as an attorney at Ford Motor Co.</p>\n<p>Now retired, he says the raises and benefits he got from Ford were not worth giving up for something else. Plus, he just liked his colleagues.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/poll-reveals-age-income-influence-peoples-loyalty-to-employer/\">Poll reveals age, income influence people&#8217;s loyalty to employer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\t\r\n\r\n\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/poll-reveals-age-income-influence-peoples-loyalty-to-employer/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t <itunes:summary>A new poll says more than 40 percent of America's baby boomers stayed with their employer for more than 20 years.
