A new simplified smart TV experience, makes it easy to access over-the-air broadcast and online streaming entertainment services\u00a0including Netflix, Stan, and Presto, YouTube and more. While accessing IPTV isn&#8217;t new, the performance available in the latest generation of displays means that switching between apps and channels is as close to channel up/down as we&#8217;ve ever been. Being able to\u00a0pin an IPTV stream next to an OTA channel, all without changing HDMI inputs is seriously awesome and long overdue.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XcWB5OYzZZ4?rel=0\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The UI interaction is wicked fast thanks to multi-core processors inside, something severely missed in many smart TVs. While the TV runs Tizen OS, not Android TV, because of the brand power of Samsung, they have been able to attract decent app development on the platform.</p>\n<p>The industrial design of the 2016 Series 9 TVs is stunning,\u00a0with a seriously thin display, a\u00a0metallic stand, its designed to look great from every angle. While it may have curves in all the right places,\u00a0I would encourage Samsung to consider a flat version of each model, as those looking to wall-mount, should be able avoid curved edges bending away from the wall. The last thing you should be forced to do is to buy a Series 8, just to get a flat TV.</p>\n<p>Vice President, Consumer Electronics, Samsung Electronics Australia, Carl Rose said</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe new range of SUHD TVs represent the pinnacle of what television should deliver Australians, while making the experience easy, whatever your home entertainment habits are..\u201d</p>\n<p>&#8220;The way Australians experience home television has evolved dramatically in terms of viewing habits and access to on-demand or streaming services. With the arrival of technologies like HDR, and access to 4K Blu-ray discs, this launch comes at an important time for the industry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal is to create the ultimate television experience for Australians, bringing together multiple content sources in one seamless, easy-to-use interface, while delivering an amazing picture with our Quantum dot display technology.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Sasmsung,\u00a071 per cent of Australian households featuring an open-plan living room layout, and they suggest the new SUHD TV range will suited a wide range of home configurations. Whether the TV is set in the centre of a room, next to windows featuring bright sun during daylight hours, or mounted on a wall.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re buying a TV in 2016, you better make sure it has HDR and all of Samsung\u2019s 2016 SUHD TVs offer high dynamic range (HDR), with peak brightness of 1,000 nits for a higher level of contrast between light and dark images.</p>\n<p>Samsung\u2019s SUHD TV range further enhances the viewing experience by minimising light reflection with its Ultra Black technology. By reducing the glare on the screen, Ultra Black makes it easier to watch\u00a0your favourite content regardless of how well-lit the room is.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-173837\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UN65KS9500F_002_Back_Black_66150923.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\" alt=\"UN65KS9500F_002_Back_Black_66150923\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UN65KS9500F_002_Back_Black_66150923.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UN65KS9500F_002_Back_Black_66150923.jpg?resize=900%2C600 900w, http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UN65KS9500F_002_Back_Black_66150923.jpg?w=1200 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><strong>New Smart Hub</strong><br />\nThe 2016 Smart Hub is designed to provide easy access to content all in one place.

Installing extensions through the powerful store platform is\u00a0stark improvement over the previous experience that had users download a .zip file from the web, then manually load the extension into the browser.</p>\n<p>Right now when you the &#8216;Get extensions from the Store&#8217; link takes you to a web page to browse available extensions, with links to download them from the Store. I&#8217;d expect that middle step to be removed in the future and have the Extension link in Edge take you directly to a section of the Store where you can browse and download from the Store app.</p>\n<p>Edge also got swipe gesture support on touchscreens, adding back a feature we first got in the Metro version of IE in Windows 8. An important change that web developers should be aware of is websites can now push notifications to users. Previously the domain of apps, Microsoft Edge now supports real-time web notifications. With permission, participating websites can now send notifications to you via Action Centre.</p>\n<p>The example Microsoft provides is when your friend sends you a message on <a href=\"https://web.skype.com/\"><strong>Skype for Web</strong></a> while you\u2019re busy in the Xbox app, you won\u2019t miss a thing. A notification from the website will appear in Windows, just like an app might send. Click on the notification and you\u2019ll be right back in Microsoft Edge at the site that sent it. As long as the permissions for sites is easy to control, this sounds like good integration between the browser and the OS that ultimately benefits users.</p>\n<p>You can read more about this latest Windows Insider build over at <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/05/10/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14342/\">Building Windows </a>blog.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-173832\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Edge2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\" alt=\"Edge2\" srcset=\"http://i2.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Edge2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, http://i2.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Edge2.jpg?resize=900%2C600 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://techau.com.au/edge-extensions-hit-the-store-in-windows-10-build-14342/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Hyperloop One will test propulsion tomorrow, full scale in Q4</title>\n\t\t<link>http://techau.com.au/hyperloop-one-just-showed-off-their-prototype-propulsion-test-tomorrow/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://techau.com.au/hyperloop-one-just-showed-off-their-prototype-propulsion-test-tomorrow/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 00:30:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jason Cartwright]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Travel]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hyperloop]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[HyperloopOne]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://techau.com.au/?p=173820</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[&#160; Hyperloop One (formerly HyperloopTech) says they are heading for a full speed, full scale test of their Hyperloop prototype\u00a0in\u00a0Q4 2016.

DJI Inspire 1 drones are being used by Elevated Robotic Services, on behalf of the Alberta government and insurance broker Hub International Ltd.</p>\n<p>These aren&#8217;t your regular\u00a0consumer level\u00a0drones that have caused issues in fire fighting incidents in the past, instead they are professional grade drones outfitted with infrared, ultraviolet and traditional optical cameras to\u00a0track down\u00a0the hottest part of the fire which could lead to the source of the fire.\u00a0Other factors like time,\u00a0wind and accelerants are all taken into account when making these assessments. The drones will take about 800 images, which then get stitched together to create an overall map of the affected area, this is known as fire-mapping.</p>\n<p>Mat Matthews, Operation and Safety Manager at Elevated Robotic Services said,</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like Google Maps but 100 times better,&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Right now the ignition point is like finding a needle in a massive haystack. The using of imaging technology will help narrow the possible locations to 9 metre radius. It is expected the fire started from a lightning strike, however authorities haven&#8217;t ruled out the possibility of it being deliberately lit.</p>\n<p>Another advantage of using drones is that they&#8217;re unmanned, so flying them into environments will poor visibility is possible. Where as\u00a0helicopter pilot may need to avoid smoke and hover at around 1,000 feet,\u00a0a drone can capture images from 100 feet above, resulting in much better detail and final stich.</p>\n<p>While the battery powered drones suffer from short battery life, they can work in teams and they can work on pre-configured GPS grids.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gy-_GEg7JIw\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>More information at <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-wildfire-drones-idUSKCN0XY0LK\">Reuters</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://techau.com.au/canada-is-burning-and-dji-inspire-drones-are-helping-find-out-why/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Samsung first to market in Australia with 4K, Ultra HD Blu-Ray player</title>\n\t\t<link>http://techau.com.au/samsung-first-to-market-in-australia-with-4k-ultra-hd-blu-ray-player/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://techau.com.au/samsung-first-to-market-in-australia-with-4k-ultra-hd-blu-ray-player/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 23:40:43 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jason Cartwright]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hardware]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[HD-DVD vs Blue-Ray]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Blu-ray]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Optical]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Samsung]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[UHD]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://techau.com.au/?p=173807</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Samsung Electronics Australia has announced the local availability of the Samsung 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player.

Typically rendering a 3D world twice, one for each eye, dramatically increases the demand on the GPU, but Nvidia have created a new pipeline that eliminates the waste between rendered pixels and what you actually see. Today, the resolution of virtual reality is relatively low compared to standard gaming, but with the GTX 1080, that gap closes to be almost non-existent. This means quality settings can be on max, while keeping the framerate high enough to deliver the optimal experience. Nvidia says that while regular gaming can get away with 60fps, VR really needs closer to 90fps to ensuring absolutely smooth motion.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-173802\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Perf.jpg?resize=1024%2C583\" alt=\"Perf\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Perf.jpg?resize=1024%2C583 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Perf.jpg?resize=900%2C513 900w, http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Perf.jpg?w=1211 1211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>President and CEO of Nvidia, Jen-Hsun Huang announced the company had spend multiple billions of dollars in R&amp;D\u00a0dedicated thousands of people over the last few years to create the\u00a0new 16NM platform known as &#8216;Pascal&#8217;.</p>\n<h3>Nvidia GTX 1080</h3>\n<p>The the GTX 1080 is the first card running on Pascal and features\u00a08GB of DDR5X RAM running at a staggering 10Gbps. The GPU itself has a phenomenal 2560 CUDA Cores and runs up to 1.733Ghz stock. Jen-Hsun says there&#8217;s plenty of room for overclocking. During a demo on stage, they showed the GTX 1080 running at 2.1GHz on air cooling sitting at a very comfortable 67 degrees Celsius.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">2114MHz GPU clock.

At the end of the press conference, Nvidia released the pricing and availability. The Nvidia GTX 1080 will be released world-wide on May 7th. The card will cost US$599.. which for the level of performance you get, is quite honestly, impressive. By the time it lands in Australia, expect the price to be around the $1,000 mark, but given this is faster than 2x GTX 980 in SLI, gaming enthusiasts and professionals will actually spend less than previous generations. Of course if you&#8217;re a business, you can run the GTX 1080 in SLI configuration to get the most insane level of performance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p>\nThe GeForce GTX 1080. 9 Teraflops. 8GB GDDRX5 $699 Founders edition. $599 MSRP.

They did a clumsy job of explaining the solution, but the solution is an important one. Typically there&#8217;s a disconnect between the arrangement of our monitors and what the game understands our display configuration to be. What triple-display games do is render 3 display images out, that run parallel, in the same line, but we usually angle the screens around us to add to the immersion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p>\nIntroducing simultaneous multi-projection, a new tech that compensates for all kinds of new display technologies. <a href=\"https://t.co/E6ib3CqzC7\">pic.twitter.com/E6ib3CqzC7</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/728765989626617856\">May 7, 2016</a>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<h3>Simultaneous Multi-projection</h3>\n<p>While games have had some digital compensation to solve the difference in flat vs angled display images, however they still don&#8217;t achieve what Nvidia&#8217;s hardware solution does. Nvidia&#8217;s demo showed off the 3 images rendered accurately as to create the effect of looking out a window, so something like the gutter of a street, remains straight, rather than angled at the edges between displayed.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p>Using simultaneous multi-projection, you can go from a warped view (left) to a corrected, full view. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameReady?src=hash\">#GameReady</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/LvHXAXmy03\">pic.twitter.com/LvHXAXmy03</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/728767724998905857\">May 7, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<h3>Nvidia Ansel</h3>\n<p>Also announced during this morning&#8217;s press conference was a new in-game camera engine developers can use to let gamers generate high res, or even 360 degree panoramas, turning their extensive work on visual quality, into works of art. This will be available in 7 games to start with, but Nvidia is hoping lots of game developers add it in. As a GearVR owner, I&#8217;m all for being able to share in-game experiences in VR. Imagine you climb to the peak of a mountain in Tomb Raider and you look out over a gorgeous mountainous scene, you&#8217;ll want to share that, but currently you have to take a screenshot, which really only captures a subset of the environment you&#8217;re in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve just got a brand new 4K monitor and are looking for a high resolution wallpaper, then consider Ansel, as they&#8217;re not joking about the capability to render out a high res image. The system will support images of a resolution up to 12,000 pixels wide. After recently reviewing Canon&#8217;s 750D, I noted that its max quality images are 6000 x 4000 images, so that gives you some perspective.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The live demo featured a HTC Vive, but Nvidia also says these experiences will also be consumable using Google Cardboard. If game makers can watermark these high res images and VR exports, they&#8217;ll serve as great marketing for the game.\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p>\nUsing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/witnessgame\">@witnessgame</a>, NVIDIA Ansel enables a beautiful high-res image over what was an obstacle &#8211; running water. <a href=\"https://t.co/1a5wA1HiVI\">pic.twitter.com/1a5wA1HiVI</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/728755938031734784\">May 7, 2016</a>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">NVIDIA Ansel is coming to these 7 games (and many more) soon! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameReady?src=hash\">#GameReady</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iMv8hv143B\">pic.twitter.com/iMv8hv143B</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/728756717375266818\">May 7, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://techau.com.au/nvidia-gtx-1080-cost-billions-new-fastest-gpu-ready-for-vr/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>McDonalds turns paper placemat into a DJ touchpad called McTrax</title>\n\t\t<link>http://techau.com.au/mcdonalds-turned-the-placemat-into-a-dj-touchpad/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://techau.com.au/mcdonalds-turned-the-placemat-into-a-dj-touchpad/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 11:57:34 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jason Cartwright]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hardware]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[DJ]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[McDonalds]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[MCTrax]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[PlayThePlacemat]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://techau.com.au/?p=173782</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[McDonalds are leveraging technology to draw in new customers.

After having owned the 500D, the 650D I was keen to see the progress and improvements made with the 750D. From the moment you open the box, Canon owners will notice a lot a familiar design cues and positioning with the 750D, which will mean you&#8217;ll be up and running quickly. For new owners, the camera feels well waited in the hand, modes and function selections are all in logical positions, with photo-specific controls available in reach of your right thumb and your index finger will rest over the shutter button. If you need to adjust the exposure between photos the convenient wheel is easy to access.</p>\n<p>In this release, Canon have refined the mode selector dial and you&#8217;ll notice in the photo below, the 750D (right) has a simplified dial featuring larger and a few less modes. In reality, everything you need to configure is also available using the touchscreen on the back and the live exposure preview makes getting the right shot far easier than the typical spray and pray approach.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-173726\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_111538.jpg?resize=1024%2C576\" alt=\"20160425_111538\" srcset=\"http://i2.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_111538.jpg?resize=1024%2C576 1024w, http://i2.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_111538.jpg?resize=900%2C506 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the\u00a0biggest additions on the 750D is the inclusion of WiFi. This is a feature I&#8217;ve long campaigned for and really helps to address the photography struggle with media and publishing workflows. Often I&#8217;ve found myself shooting at an event and having to pop out the micro-SD card from the adapter, insert it into the back of the Surface to transfer the photos and share them to social media. When you work on a Newspaper or Magazine, you&#8217;re not so sensitive to the time requirements of this workflow, when you work online, seconds matter and having the most efficient workflow to publish can make the difference between a small and large amount of traffic to your post.</p>\n<p>To get up and running with the WiFi connectivity, grab the &#8216;Canon Camera Connect&#8217; app from Google Play or the App Store, then enabling the WiFi option on the camera through\u00a0the Menu button. Connect you&#8217;re phone to the camera&#8217;s WiFi access point, and once the two are connected, you&#8217;ll have the option to view the images on the camera SD card, use remote shooting (wireless) and also adjust camera settings. This wireless control over the camera opens up new opportunity for the camera.</p>\n<p>Imagine you&#8217;re shooting a wedding, you could actually connect and shoot photos from a different location. Imagine you need to review those photos and share them out to social media during the ceremony, for family who couldn&#8217;t attend.</p>\n<p>The camera also features NFC to assist with the connection to Apple or Android phones, just tap on the left shoulder to initiate the connection. Once connected, being able to get the photo on your phone, helps solve the issue of shareability to social networks, a common path to publishing your photography. There is a limitation of photos only on this WiFi transfer, so videos will still need to be transferred manually.</p>\n<p>Another important feature of photography is the ability to capture photos\u00a0with fast-moving objects or people, which\u00a0often means achieving the right focus quickly. Imagine you&#8217;re the parent on the side of the soccer field, you pan from left to right to focus on your kid about to kick a goal. The 750D features 19 points of AutoFocus to make sure objects are in focus. The 750D does a great job and whether your capturing a high-speed racing car coming over a crest, or your cute baby that never holds still, the camera does a great job of freezing the action and keeping things in focus. Of course when you find yourself in an\u00a0environment\u00a0you can control and setup a shot,\u00a0you have the option to kill AutoFocus and dial in the focus point precisely to hit that perfect depth of field effect.</p>\n<p>The rear screen on the 750D is a 3.0&#8243; touchscreen has a 3:2 ratio and like the last model, rotates to allow the\u00a0use the camera at otherwise unusable angles like close to the ground, or over a crowd. While not new\u00a0to this model, the touchscreen feels more responsive and is a critical inclusion that enables complex and fringe case scenarios.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-173733\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_112018.jpg?resize=1024%2C576\" alt=\"20160425_112018\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_112018.jpg?resize=1024%2C576 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_112018.jpg?resize=900%2C506 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h2>Quality</h2>\n<p>The 750D has an upgraded to a image processor &#8211;\u00a0DIG!C 6 and features 24.2 Megapixels in quality. As the megapixels grow, you also need to be conscious of the additional file size you&#8217;re consuming. On average, photos taken with the Canon EOS 750D are between 5-8Mb in size depending on the complexity of the photo and at max the camera can shoot a massive 6000 x 4000 pixel photos. This means you can easily create amazing desktop wallpaper that has the necessary size to avoid stretching. There&#8217;s also amazing detail if you decide to print them off and make some artwork for your wall. While not in the pro range of cameras, beginners could certainly create some very usable wedding or portrait photography sessions.</p>\n<p>Canon says this creates incredible\u00a0image quality even in low light situations and that&#8217;s definitely true. It&#8217;s a relatively minor improvement over previous models though, its certainly visually noticeable but it&#8217;s not night and day like the progress we&#8217;ve seen in low-light development on smartphones in recent months. There&#8217;s improvements to the noise found in images taken at ISOs, however I found most of my shooting wasn&#8217;t at the extreme ends of the ISO range.</p>\n<p>In terms of video quality, the 750D still only shoots 1920x1080p video at 25fps. That&#8217;s relatively low considered the world is rapidly moving to 4K and the phone in my pocket, the Galaxy S7 can shoot in 4K right now.\u00a0Sure video on a DSLR isn&#8217;t everyone&#8217;s highest priority, but if you&#8217;re asking people to still hand over north of a thousand dollars for a dedicated device that shoots photos and videos, it better do both exceptionally well.</p>\n\n<a

difficult to justify lugging around a far heavily, less convenient DSLR. A couple of years ago, every birthday party was blanketed by\u00a0dedicated\u00a0cameras, but more recently, you&#8217;ll notice most are just using their phones.</p>\n<p>This means the quality, features and functionality to offset the weight and inconvenience, can&#8217;t just be a little better than phones, it has to be seriously\u00a0better than what we can achieve with our\u00a0mobiles cameras. There are absolutely environments that you can&#8217;t get closer to, so having a zoom lens is one of those big benefits a DSLR still offers.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-173731\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_111951.jpg?resize=1024%2C576\" alt=\"20160425_111951\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_111951.jpg?resize=1024%2C576 1024w, http://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_111951.jpg?resize=900%2C506 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h2>Speed</h2>\n<p>Every Canon camera features different modes\u00a0which modify camera settings to achieve the\u00a0perfect photo in each scenario. In burst mode, you can hold down the\u00a0button and fire the shutter off at up to five frames per second. In reality, I found the camera to be a little slower than the claimed 5fps, but its certainly an improvement on the 2-3fps we had just a year or 2 ago. The amount of times where I find myself bursting is less and less often as I better understand the work involved in finding the right frame out of 100 to choose from. In practical terms, your best bet is to become a better photographer, rather than rely on Canon improving the frames per second.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-173737\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_112540.jpg?resize=1024%2C576\" alt=\"20160425_112540\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_112540.jpg?resize=1024%2C576 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_112540.jpg?resize=900%2C506 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-173722\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_111328.jpg?resize=1024%2C576\" alt=\"20160425_111328\" srcset=\"http://i2.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_111328.jpg?resize=1024%2C576 1024w, http://i2.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_111328.jpg?resize=900%2C506 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h2>Issues</h2>\n<p>While there&#8217;s plenty to love about the 750D, there are some changes that Canon have made that aren&#8217;t exactly user-friendly. As an owner of previous Canon EOS DSLR&#8217;s, I expect to be able use my existing accessories like my battery grip, and extra batteries from my 650D. Unfortunately Canon have yet again changed the size of their batteries and the battery compartment which means you&#8217;re up for new accessories if you upgrade to the 750D. If you&#8217;re starting fresh, this won&#8217;t matter, expect Canon&#8217;s now shown a history or changes in this area, so be aware, this could happen again. I struggle to think of a technical reason the batteries needed to change in this version considering the overall body size hasn&#8217;t changed and the battery got smaller, not larger, so they can&#8217;t argue battery life.</p>\n<p>Thankfully you will be able to reuse your biggest investment, additional lenses.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-173738\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_113452.jpg?resize=1024%2C576\" alt=\"20160425_113452\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_113452.jpg?resize=1024%2C576 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160425_113452.jpg?resize=900%2C506 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h2>Price &amp; Availability</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.canon.com.au/en-AU/Personal/Products/Cameras-and-Accessories/EOS-Digital-SLR-Cameras/EOS-750D\">Canon EOS 750D</a> comes in a number of varieties, the cheapest being body-only, a great option if you&#8217;re already in the Canon family and have investments in lenses.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular will be the Single IS STM Lens Kit which is the version we reviewed. This includes the 750D body and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Lens and is available at <a href=\"https://www.jbhifi.com.au/cameras/dslr/canon/canon-750dkis-24mp-digital-slr-camera-with-18-55mm-is-stm-lens/707749/\">JB Hi-Fi for a pretty affordable A$1,049</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Overall</h2>\n<p>After spending time with the Canon EOS 750D, the changes made in this model make a great camera, even better. Most of the\u00a0improvement claims do stack up and that WiFi inclusion is seriously long overdue, but now much appreciated. The extra functionality it opens up and the reduction in workflow to socially share or even print photos is a massive step forward.</p>\n<p>The changes to the batter are infuriating and a really anti-user move, a change that\u00a0I hope they end with this model. For an existing Canon DSLR owner with a recent model, its really hard to justify this upgrade. However for someone who&#8217;s new to photography or an enthusiast who wants to get into fringe-case photography, this is a very capable camera for the price. I fear the biggest competition Canon now face, isn&#8217;t from the likes of Nikon, but from the smartphones who&#8217;s cameras are now sufficient for capturing day-to-day life in stunning quality. It really is only something like zoom lenses that can help you justify the price and weight of carrying a DSLR in 2016.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://techau.com.au/review-canon-eos-750d/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Telstra-backed Aussie startup, QubeRider is off to space</title>\n\t\t<link>http://techau.com.au/telstra-backed-aussie-startup-is-off-to-space/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://techau.com.au/telstra-backed-aussie-startup-is-off-to-space/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 06:47:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jason Cartwright]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Space]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Australia]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Government]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[space]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Startup]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://techau.com.au/?p=173765</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Australian startup, Quberider is a space education company that sends student experiments to the International Space Station.

This really is an exciting success story for Australia one we&#8217;ll likely look back on in the future and point to as a pivotal moment in Australia&#8217;s space history.</p>\n<p>Latest this year, the startup will send their\u00a0payload to the\u00a0<span class=\"_58cl\"><a class=\"_58cn\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/internationalspacestation?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=1161957340521051\" data-ft=\"{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;*N&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:104}\">\u202a</a>International Space Station.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-173768\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ASIMOV.jpg?resize=902%2C632\" alt=\"ASIMOV\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ASIMOV.jpg?w=902 902w, http://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ASIMOV.jpg?resize=900%2C631 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://techau.com.au/telstra-backed-aussie-startup-is-off-to-space/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Melbourne&#8217;s 30km/h zone is a dumb, tech-less solution to &#8216;rat-running&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://techau.com.au/melbournes-30kmh-zone-is-a-dumb-tech-less-solution-to-rat-running/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://techau.com.au/melbournes-30kmh-zone-is-a-dumb-tech-less-solution-to-rat-running/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 11:13:28 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jason Cartwright]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Government]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vehicle]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Melbourne]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Traffic]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Transport]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://techau.com.au/?p=173750</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Australian cities\u00a0suffer from the same congestion problems experienced around the globe.

We look to our leaders and our politicians to\u00a0solve that congestion but this latest solution is ridiculous. When left up to their own devices, drivers will seek out the fastest route possible and often do this by\u00a0avoiding commonly congested main arterial routes through the city. Instead drivers will often take longer journeys in terms of kilometers that get them to their destination faster.</p>\n<p>Apparently Mayor of the City of Yarra, Roberto Colzani thinks this needs to end. To deter commuters from zipping down side streets, also known as, taking a more efficient route,\u00a0he\u00a0wants to\u00a0implement a 30km/hr speed zone, 24 hours a day. A 12-month trial of the ultra-slow speed zone would run in Fitzroy and Colzani justifies\u00a0it with this gem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a fair body of academic literature, particularly internationally, talking about even going down to the equivalent of 20 [kph] in certain areas,&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s always multiple ways to solve a problem and the least interesting, least ambitious and frankly the most tech-illiterate is to put a handbrake on everyone and make them go slower. The hope is that drivers will find it so\u00a0slow, they&#8217;ll avoid the area, pushing the problem to another area.</p>\n<p>Instead what the Mayor should be doing is promoting the benefits of leveraging today&#8217;s technology to reduce traffic congestion and encourage drivers to follow directions that provide them the most efficient route, based on live-traffic data. That&#8217;s the fastest way to get cars from A-to-B, not artificially slow them down.</p>\n<p>For years enthusiasts have leveraged services like <a href=\"https://www.waze.com\">Waze</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/mobile/?hl=en\">Google Maps</a> or even <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/au/ios/maps/\">Apple Maps</a>\u00a0to make sure they avoid road works and accidents, but the problem for the city is, not enough people use GPS for familiar routes. Most people won&#8217;t plug the same destinations (work and homes) into the GPS every time they get into their car and fair enough too, you know best as a driver right? Wrong, you can never compete with the live traffic and emergency information, populated by other drivers and updated every second.</p>\n<p>While new fancy cars have voice commands and integrated navigation systems that would make this easier, the reality is in 2016, most don&#8217;t, so we use our phones. It certainly should be in a phone cradle mounted in a safe position, to see and hear directions.\u00a0App developers could come to the party as well, leveraging location information and historical data to automatically determine if the driver is heading on a regular commute.</p>\n<p>With technology we can actually improve the congestion in our cities and delay or in some cases eliminate the need to spend millions of dollars upgrading\u00a0road infrastructure to decrease commute times. One thing&#8217;s for sure setting up a trajectory where street by street we reduce the speed of vehicles until we&#8217;re walking faster, is no solution at all.</p>\n<p>Thankfully this plan for a trial does require approval from VicRoads before it can commence. Hopefully they see more sense.</p>\n<p>More information at <a href=\"http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-02/fitzroy-30kph-speed-limit-trial-aims-to-stop-rat-running/7375524?section=vic\">ABC</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://techau.com.au/melbournes-30kmh-zone-is-a-dumb-tech-less-solution-to-rat-running/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
