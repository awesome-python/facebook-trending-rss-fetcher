People with BDD spend at least <a href=\"https://bdd.iocdf.org/professionals/diagnosis/\">an hour per day</a> (but often even longer) thinking about a flaw in their appearance that&#39;s either minor or not there at all, says <a href=\"http://dr-mccurdy-mckinnon.squarespace.com/\">Danyale McCurdy-McKinnon, Ph.D.</a>, licensed clinical psychologist and clinical psychology director of the UCLA Fit for Healthy Weight Clinic. About 2.5% of adults in the U.S. have a diagnosis of BDD, says Sari Fine Shepphird, Ph.D., licensed psychologist and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0763754501/?tag=buzz0f-20\"><i>100 Questions &amp; Answers About Anorexia Nervosa</i></a>. </p>\n\n<p>BDD seems to occur just about evenly in men and women, though men are more likely to have preoccupations with muscle size or genitals, says Fine Shepphird. In fact, the subset of BDD called muscle dysmorphia (which is characterized by distorted thoughts about muscle size, shape, and leanness) is almost exclusively diagnosed in men.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>A person with BDD might be focused on something about their appearance that's real or imagined.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/28/15/enhanced/webdr05/enhanced-6639-1461873339-1.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"316\" alt=\"A person with BDD might be focused on something about their appearance that's real or imagined.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>For example, they might think their nose is distractingly huge or misshapen when it&#39;s objectively ordinary. Or they might be focused on something that is actually there, like acne or a scar. Whether the object of their focus is something real or imagined, a person with BDD would experience consuming preoccupation with it and also believe that their \"flaw\" makes them hideous or even disfigured, says McCurdy-McKinnon.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Obsessive behaviors and intrusive thoughts are hallmarks of BDD.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/29/14/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-10225-1461955199-6.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"316\" alt=\"Obsessive behaviors and intrusive thoughts are hallmarks of BDD.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>People with BDD engage in compulsive or repetitive behaviors, explains Fine Shepphird, like constant mirror checking, obsessively picking at their skin or hair, or excessively exercising, grooming, or comparing themselves to others</p>\n\n<p>In severe cases, people may also seek cosmetic surgery to \"correct\" whatever they perceive is wrong. These grooming or checking behaviors are time-consuming and life-disrupting and can even feel intrusive and unwanted, like the person is unable to prevent or stop them.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Which is not the same thing as the average person's dissatisfaction with their appearance.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/29/14/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-18113-1461955533-15.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"316\" alt=\"Which is not the same thing as the average person's dissatisfaction with their appearance.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>It&#39;s not uncommon to feel self-conscious or even wish you could tweak something about your appearance. But BDD comes with more serious and disruptive thoughts and behaviors, says McCurdy-McKinnon. Someone who does not have BDD might say something like, \"My thighs are big; it&#39;s tough to find jeans I like.\" A person with BDD might say, \"My thighs are giant. They are so big that I&#39;m hideous. I have to hide them.\" She says that someone with BDD might use words like \"disgusting,\" \"hideous,\" or \"grotesque,\" and that these words would reflect their deep-rooted beliefs about their appearance, as opposed to being a passing comment.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/body-dysmorphic-disorder\">View Entire List &rsaquo;</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Sally Tamarkin</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/body-dysmorphic-disorder</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:01:03 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n  <media:description type=\"html\">It&#x27;s not just another way of saying low self-esteem.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">sallytamarkin</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/18/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web04/13-things-you-need-to-know-about-body-dysmorphic--2-13903-1463093301-6.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n</media:content>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>I Grew My Armpit Hair Out For A Month And This Is What Happened</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahburton/body-hair-dont-care?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>It didn&#8217;t go smoothly&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/5/17/enhanced/webdr10/anigif_enhanced-12600-1462482957-6.gif\" width=\"625\" height=\"868\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Mollie Shafer-Schweig / Taylor Miller / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>I know what some of you are thinking.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/28/13/enhanced/webdr08/anigif_enhanced-14880-1461863280-2.gif\" width=\"625\" height=\"352\" alt=\"I know what some of you are thinking.\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Fox</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>Look, I&#39;m all for equality between the sexes.

And then my legs. And then I thought I might as well get rid of all my body hair, so I shaved my arms too. When I came downstairs for school, my mom laughed at me, but I still think the mistake was completely understandable. After all, how do we decide what hair is OK and what hair has to go? What about the hair above my lips? My eyebrows? What is the right amount of hair?\n\nAs a fairly pale woman with relatively dark, thick hair, I&#x27;ve always struggled with removing body hair. Guys may have 5 o&#x27;clock shadows, but by 2 p.m., my pit hair has already started sprouting alongside my razor burn.\n\nEven though I know not shaving should be totally cool, I find myself falling back on deeply ingrained, reflexive disgust at the sight of &#x22;uncured&#x22; and &#x22;unsightly&#x22; body hair. One of my favorite bands is Chairlift, and a few years ago, they released a Japanese version of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RRc0T3l1Co&#x22;&#x3E;&#x22;I Belong in Your Arms.&#x22;&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"352\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/25/14/enhanced/webdr02/anigif_enhanced-6619-1461608044-2.gif\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">But WHY? Body hair is on (almost) every human. So why am I so upset to see it? I wondered if seeing normally shaved-off hair on my own body would help me come to terms with it not only on my own body, but on others&#x27; as well. \n\nSince that day in middle school, I&#x27;ve never gone a full month without shaving my legs, let alone my armpits. No longer. I decided I would put down the razor and try growing out my body hair, for a full month, to challenge my own judgment and stigma.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"491\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/28/15/enhanced/webdr13/enhanced-11203-1461872056-2.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"569\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/2/12/enhanced/webdr03/edit-4118-1462208095-8.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Even though I took these photos mere HOURS after I shaved, my armpit was still not perfectly smooth, and therefore, in my mind (and the patriarchy&#x2019;s), I was not perfectly feminine.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"463\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/15/enhanced/webdr07/grid-cell-16565-1463083032-16.jpg\" width=\"309\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"463\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/15/enhanced/webdr07/grid-cell-16565-1463083034-21.jpg\" width=\"309\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"166\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/5/17/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-16075-1462483034-3.png\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">My hair month unfortunately began when I was in Florida, where the weather would not allow me to hide my hairs with long sleeves and pants. Then again, I was just starting, and it really wasn&#x27;t THAT bad. It actually helped my lingering razor burn to heal. \n\nWait, why do we shave again? There have to be deeper reasons beyond the obvious desire to have Sphynx cats for armpits.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"795\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/28/16/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-13899-1461875344-1.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"695\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/28/15/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-19785-1461873384-1.png\" width=\"460\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">But removing hair could also be religious.

That might explain why we might associate cleanliness with removing hair &#x2014; but it doesn&#x27;t really explain why, in so many parts of the world, we place those expectations on women, but not men.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"166\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/5/17/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-16191-1462483061-8.png\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">This was the worst week. I feared I wouldn&#x27;t be able to make it through the month. It wasn&#x27;t the leg hair that bothered me. It was the pit hair. Thicker than my leg hair, my pit hair had formed quarter-inch spikes that would stab into each other any time I lifted and dropped my arm. The discomfort felt like enough motivation for shaving in itself. Still, I knew that this irritation was likely just growing pains, and they would not last.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"166\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/5/17/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-14685-1462483080-9.png\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">By the third week, my hair had grown past the nuisance phase. I kept forgetting it was there &#x2014; until I got in the shower. Honestly, because your armpits are RIGHT by your face, the hair there looks far darker and thicker than it does to anybody else. I had trouble shaking that. Even though it was the first hot week in New York (FINALLY!), I wore tops with sleeves all week. But on the weekend, I knew I had to let the girls out. That&#x27;s right, my armpits are female.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">It was weirdly liberating to &#x201C;not care&#x201D; what people thought of my armpits. Deep down, I of course did care that I was being judged, but sometimes you have to fake it until you make it. I got to the point where I wanted to get a reaction from someone, so I kept grabbing for things above me in my sleeveless top. Nobody said anything. Nobody cared. People weren&#x2019;t screaming and running in fright from my hairy pitzillas.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"307\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/2/13/enhanced/webdr13/grid-cell-27987-1462209091-5.jpg\" width=\"203\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"307\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/2/13/enhanced/webdr13/grid-cell-27987-1462209095-10.jpg\" width=\"203\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"307\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/2/13/enhanced/webdr13/grid-cell-27987-1462209101-15.jpg\" width=\"203\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"166\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/5/17/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-2326-1462483098-7.png\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">This week I learned hairy pits have different upkeep than hairless pits.

I was excited to shave and be smooth-ish again. The truth is that having less hair on my body helps me feel more distinct from my Neanderthal ancestors. But I am definitely comfortable saying I will be shaving less often going forward. People don&#x27;t stare at your arm hairs, and they don&#x27;t stare at your armpits. If you take a few days off from shaving, honestly, your pits will thank you. \n\nI&#x27;m grateful that I went through with this. Society makes us feel like we&#x27;re freaks if we don&#x27;t shave &#x2014; but screw SOCIETY, you know? The choice is ours. I rewatched the Chairlift music video, and I thought, &#x3C;i&#x3E;She doesn&#x27;t even have much hair at all&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. I wasn&#x27;t grossed out, because I know what it&#x27;s like to have hairy pits. And really, it&#x27;s just not that different. \n\nIf you want to go au naturel, do it. If you prefer shaven, do that. The point is, body hair isn&#x27;t gross. And if you&#x27;re someone, like me, who can&#x27;t help but feel judgmental about body hair, I highly recommend trying to grow out hair yourself. It just might turn that &#x22;ew&#x22; into an &#x22;eh.&#x22; NBD.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"456\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/28/13/enhanced/webdr05/anigif_enhanced-8313-1461864453-2.gif\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"278\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/6/13/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-31917-1462555692-6.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>7 Tips For People Who Struggle To Fall Asleep</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarapocock/7-tips-for-people-who-struggle-to-fall-asleep?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>Gotta get those ZZZs</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-16497-1463012212-1.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"948\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Sara Pocock / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-15527-1463012357-1.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"625\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Sara Pocock / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-17375-1463012389-2.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"625\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Sara Pocock / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-17359-1463012438-1.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"625\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Sara Pocock / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarapocock/7-tips-for-people-who-struggle-to-fall-asleep\">View Entire List &rsaquo;</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Sara Pocock</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarapocock/7-tips-for-people-who-struggle-to-fall-asleep</guid>\n<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 20:26:51 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n  <media:description type=\"html\">Gotta get those ZZZs</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">sarapocock</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/20/campaign_images/webdr15/7-tips-for-people-who-struggle-to-fall-asleep-2-12053-1463012807-9.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n</media:content>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>I Hated My Body Until It Stopped Working</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliegerstein/i-hated-my-body-until-it-stopped-working?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/3/15/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-mid-5439-1462303473-5.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"465\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Charlotte Gomez / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Every month, the <i>New York Times</i> <i>Magazine</i> runs a feature called &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/column/diagnosis\">Diagnosis</a>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s about hard-to-solve medical mysteries: women with strange spots, men with failing kidneys. The stories are told in fits and starts, and readers are invited to weigh in and guess what&rsquo;s actually wrong with the patients. In the end, the medical mystery is solved by a clever team of doctors. The patient&rsquo;s problems are rarely neatly resolved, but always managed in a hopeful and determined way.</p><p>&ldquo;Diagnosis&rdquo; was often my favorite thing to read in the magazine on Sunday mornings, satisfying my inner hypochondriac and detective &mdash; until I found myself living one of those medical mysteries.</p><p>I was upstate with some friends when the itching began. At first it was localized in a thin band across my thighs. It seemed like dry skin, so I slathered on lotion and thought nothing of it. But then the itching continued, and spread. It was up my legs and down them. It was on my hips, my stomach.</p><p>I traveled to Los Angeles, and the itching continued. Despite the warmer climate, my skin was red and bruised from the constant scratching. I made multiple stops at the pharmacy, investing in a tub of medical grade Aquaphor, hoping to get some relief. I bought Cortisone creams and took oatmeal baths.</p><p>After two weeks of nearly nonstop, skin-tingling itching, I went to my doctor, who shrugged, put me on a battery of over-the-counter antihistamines, and sent out a vial of my blood for testing. &ldquo;Did you know that unspecified itching could be a sign of blood cancer or a liver problem?&rdquo; he told me cheerfully.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>I woke up in the middle of the night with blood on my stomach from scratching myself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually I was told I had <i>dermatographia urticaria</i>, a form of hives where the body produces histamines &mdash; those substances your body produces during an allergic reaction &mdash; unchecked. (It also goes by the sexy moniker of &ldquo;skin writing,&rdquo; because sufferers are often able to make words and images appear on their skin by pressing in with their fingernails or a stick.)

To really treat it, you have to determine the underlying cause, except sometimes there IS no underlying cause.

The desire to scratch what itches has moved from the physical to something heavier &mdash; the itch is as much in my head as in my skin and under it. Letting go of it, getting relief from the relief that scratching provides, is something that&rsquo;s much harder to figure out.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/3/15/enhanced/webdr07/enhanced-mid-17786-1462303542-11.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"120\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>But there is another thing: I have come, in these last few months of itching and scratching and noxious welts, to realize that I missed the point of my body for so long. When your body betrays you, when you have to focus all of your time and attention on just being well, all the vanities you used to care about &mdash; how flat your stomach is, or how little or much you weigh, or whether your complexion is perfectly clear &mdash; don&rsquo;t compute anymore. There is something freeing in letting go of these old habits, which are themselves a kind of anguishing disease.</p><p>For as long as I have been cognizant of myself as a female, I&rsquo;ve been critical of my body &mdash; how it looks, how it rates, how it manages to fit or not against other bodies that I think are better than it. This has lead me to at times starve myself, or exercise too much, or obsess over my thighs, or my stomach, or my butt. When I think about all the hours I have wasted criticizing my body for the way it looks &mdash; a body that used to actually work fairly well, that didn&rsquo;t keep me up itching and scratching in the middle of the night &mdash; I want to scream.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>It came so late, but I now understand that my body &mdash; that any body &mdash; is not simply a competitive space meant for judging success or failure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That my body simply functioned, that it allowed me simple pleasures and a life without itching, seems so foreign now. And yet&#33; I was so miserable then, so unsatisfied&#33; So aware of the cavernous gulf between what I wanted my body to be &mdash; lithe, tall, and concave &ndash; and what it actually was. I fixated on my body&rsquo;s failings with laser precision, and greedily used up its energy on petty battles, focused on an improbable, impossible goal out of reach and in the middle distance. It came so late, but I now understand that my body &mdash; that any body &mdash; is not simply a competitive space meant for judging success or failure.</p><p>I still wake up itching at odd times. Today it was at 4:30 in the morning. I groped around in the dark for another Benadryl and tried to go back to sleep. I still don&rsquo;t know why or how or if this is going to end, but the feeling of it is exhausting. I want my hands to stop moving endlessly over my skin. And I want my mind to quiet. I want my body to work like it used to, the way it did when I took it for granted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/bodypositivityweek\">Body Positivity Week</a> is a week of content devoted to exploring and celebrating our complicated relationships with our bodies.

Letting go of it, getting relief from the relief that scratching provides, is something that&#x26;rsquo;s much harder to figure out.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/3/15/enhanced/webdr07/enhanced-mid-17786-1462303542-11.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;120&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;But there is another thing: I have come, in these last few months of itching and scratching and noxious welts, to realize that I missed the point of my body for so long. When your body betrays you, when you have to focus all of your time and attention on just being well, all the vanities you used to care about &#x26;mdash; how flat your stomach is, or how little or much you weigh, or whether your complexion is perfectly clear &#x26;mdash; don&#x26;rsquo;t compute anymore. There is something freeing in letting go of these old habits, which are themselves a kind of anguishing disease.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;For as long as I have been cognizant of myself as a female, I&#x26;rsquo;ve been critical of my body &#x26;mdash; how it looks, how it rates, how it manages to fit or not against other bodies that I think are better than it. This has lead me to at times starve myself, or exercise too much, or obsess over my thighs, or my stomach, or my butt. When I think about all the hours I have wasted criticizing my body for the way it looks &#x26;mdash; a body that used to actually work fairly well, that didn&#x26;rsquo;t keep me up itching and scratching in the middle of the night &#x26;mdash; I want to scream.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;It came so late, but I now understand that my body &#x26;mdash; that any body &#x26;mdash; is not simply a competitive space meant for judging success or failure.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;That my body simply functioned, that it allowed me simple pleasures and a life without itching, seems so foreign now. And yet&#x26;#33; I was so miserable then, so unsatisfied&#x26;#33; So aware of the cavernous gulf between what I wanted my body to be &#x26;mdash; lithe, tall, and concave &#x26;ndash; and what it actually was. I fixated on my body&#x26;rsquo;s failings with laser precision, and greedily used up its energy on petty battles, focused on an improbable, impossible goal out of reach and in the middle distance. It came so late, but I now understand that my body &#x26;mdash; that any body &#x26;mdash; is not simply a competitive space meant for judging success or failure.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I still wake up itching at odd times. Today it was at 4:30 in the morning. I groped around in the dark for another Benadryl and tried to go back to sleep. I still don&#x26;rsquo;t know why or how or if this is going to end, but the feeling of it is exhausting. I want my hands to stop moving endlessly over my skin. And I want my mind to quiet. I want my body to work like it used to, the way it did when I took it for granted.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t&#x3C;h1&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/bodypositivityweek&#x22;&#x3E;Body Positivity Week&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is a week of content devoted to exploring and celebrating our complicated relationships with our bodies.

Here&#x27;s one great &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6BdAtlV79g&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube tutorial&#x3C;/a&#x3E; but there&#x27;s a million more which show you how to wrap up your baby comfortably and safely.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/18/enhanced/webdr14/enhanced-13547-1463005383-2.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;As the baby gets older, usually around 4-6 months, it will become more mobile and start to roll over onto its stomach,&#x22; Pease says. At this point, the baby might also move enough to free itself from the swaddled blanket so everything is loose. If this happens, there&#x27;s a greater risk of a blanket getting wrapped around the baby&#x27;s head and potentially causing SIDS. \n\n&#x22;Parents should monitor their baby&#x27;s sleeping behavior closely and decide when it is time to stop swaddling the baby because it is moving too much and rolling over,&#x22; Pease says. This may happen earlier or later than 4-6 months, and every baby develops differently, which is why it&#x27;s important to know your own baby&#x27;s sleeping habits. And just to clarify, you only need to stop swaddling during sleep, but it can still be used during other situations like cuddling or breastfeeding.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/17/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-16015-1463003923-1.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">According to Pease, here are the most important things you should know about reducing your baby&#x27;s risk of SIDS: \n\n* Keep your baby face-up while sleeping\n* Know how to swaddle your baby correctly\n* Keep the face clear of any fabrics, collars, hats, etc. \n* Maintain a smoke-free house with smoke-free people\n* Do not put the baby to sleep on a couch where it can fall off or get stuck in cushions\n* Parents should stay in close proximity or in the same room as the baby&#x27;s crib\n* Maintain these same standards when you&#x27;re traveling with your baby\n\n&#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.lullabytrust.org.uk/safer-sleep&#x22;&#x3E;Click here&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to find out more about safer sleep practices.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;Parents might feel that they already know this or do this, but if everyone had this common sense, we wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do this study or write the paper,&#x22; says Pease. \n\nIt&#x27;s always good to emphasize everything parents can do, big or small, to help reduce the risk of SIDS happening, as it is a truly devastating and terrible incident. &#x22;We published this study because we want to make sure parent&#x27;s not only know the message about SIDS but they fully understand the message, too,&#x22; says Pease.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/18/enhanced/webdr14/enhanced-13452-1463005542-7.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;The headlines aren&#x27;t completely incorrect but they don&#x27;t explain that with the limitations we describe in the study, it was impossible for us to advise against swaddling,&#x22; Pease says. \n\nIn addition to this, the study only looked at swaddling during sleep, but Pease says there are also many known benefits of swaddling during breastfeeding and cuddling that parents can talk to their doctors about.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>My Best Friend Saved Me When I Attempted Suicide, But I Didn&#x27;t Save Her</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/drumoorhouse/my-best-friend-saved-me-when-i-attempted-suicide-but-i-didnt?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/10/enhanced/webdr13/longform-20813-1463062130-7.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"514\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Charlotte Gomez / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>When my friend told me</b> in the ICU that I had overdosed on my pills, I fuzzily asked, &ldquo;My birth control pills?&rdquo;</p><p>Actually, I&rsquo;d stood at the water fountain outside my dorm room and swallowed two bottles of antidepressants. I had also been drinking all day, making for a perfectly lethal cocktail.</p><p>Make no mistake, this was not a drunken whim.</p><p>Just three months earlier, I had been a patient in another medical facility: a mental hospital. My best friend, Denise, had killed herself on Christmas, and days after the funeral I told my mom that I wanted to die too. I couldn&rsquo;t forgive myself for the role I&rsquo;d played in Denise&rsquo;s death: Not only did I fail to save her, but I&rsquo;m fairly certain I gave her the idea.</p><p>Suicide has been part of my identity ever since puberty &mdash; probably when I developed major depressive disorder, which wouldn&rsquo;t be diagnosed and treated for another five years. In retrospect, I can acknowledge that I was a popular, attractive, and bright teenager, but my diary entries are peppered with thoughts of suicide and self-loathing. And when Denise and I both had a pregnancy scare (her first time having sex; my second), my &ldquo;solution&rdquo; was to gas ourselves in her red Pinto in her garage while her family wasn&#39;t home. (Our periods were probably late because of our stress about unprotected sex, and synced because we spent so much time together.)</p><p>But I was the first to make an actual attempt, swallowing 16 tablets of my brother&rsquo;s prescription medication, writing a short note soaked in tears and bathos, and calling Denise to tell her what I was doing. Of course, she rushed over and told my mother, who called poison control, and Denise and my brother raced to a drugstore to buy ipecac (a popular emetic at the time) while my mom stayed home watching me.</p><p>There was lots of drama and vomiting and attention, which I believe is exactly what I wanted.

Always the higher achiever, Denise went to the University of Iowa while I enrolled in the local University of New Mexico. Our first semesters were vastly different. I put my head down and earned straight A&rsquo;s, but Denise &mdash; like most college freshmen &mdash; reveled in her newfound freedom, her strict father unable to discipline her from a thousand miles away.<br /></p><p>Denise partied, made new friends, and found a new boyfriend, but her grades slipped. She almost failed a class. She dreaded returning home for the winter holiday and confessing the failure to her father. And she was especially excited about road-tripping back to school with her boyfriend, Todd, who planned to drive to Albuquerque so he could meet his new girlfriend&rsquo;s family. (He did make that trip and meet her family &mdash; at Denise&rsquo;s funeral.)</p><p>Christmas break wasn&rsquo;t great for either of us. My parents were divorced, and my mom and younger brothers had moved into a cheap apartment while my dad had his own semi&ndash;bachelor pad at a nearby &ldquo;disco&rdquo; complex. I wasn&rsquo;t on good terms with either of them and was renting my own first apartment while I waited to move into the UNM dorms for the spring semester in January.</p><p>On Christmas Eve, while Denise was out with her family, I dropped off my gifts at her doorstep: gourmet popcorn from the store where I had a seasonal job, and a bottle of Chanel nail polish. (She loved doing her own manicures.) I&rsquo;m sure she gave me something much more thoughtful, but I honestly don&rsquo;t remember. When I called to thank her, she was morose. Her father had forbidden her from driving back to school with Todd, and she was disappointed that she didn&rsquo;t receive the gifts she had requested (in particular, a singer&rsquo;s debut album).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>I tried calling her back throughout the day and evening, but I always got a busy signal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s when she told me she had swallowed a bunch of aspirin, and I offered my flip response about its effectiveness. I was actually <i>annoyed</i>. She had a boyfriend, an intact family, and her own bedroom to return to in her middle-class house, and she didn&rsquo;t have to work crummy part-time jobs to pay for college.</p><p>So I didn&rsquo;t take her seriously. Aspirin didn&rsquo;t even rate a mention in my paper about suicide. I expected her to sleep it off, if it had any effect at all, and maybe even have a happy outcome: Her father would be more forgiving about her grades and let her drive back to school with her boyfriend.</p><p>I tried calling her back throughout the day and evening, but I always got a busy signal. (This was before cell phones, and her family didn&rsquo;t have call waiting.) I had a nagging sense that I should drop by; after all, she probably <i>expected</i> me to, just as she had done two years earlier in response to my own halfhearted suicide attempt.</p><p>But I didn&rsquo;t go to Denise&rsquo;s house. I tried her number one last time (still busy) before going to bed. I had to work the next day and prepare for the party she and I were hosting at my apartment that night to celebrate the winter break. Nothing fancy, but it required a certain amount of coordination with our older friends who could legally buy alcohol.</p><p>In the back of my mind I must have been relieved that I didn&rsquo;t hear from Denise the next day. It was insanely busy at the popcorn shop, and I figured we would touch base before the party. And sure enough, my phone rang shortly after I arrived home. Except it wasn&rsquo;t Denise calling &mdash; it was her sister. &ldquo;Could you please come up here right away?&rdquo; she said, her voice trembling. I suddenly felt cold and a little frightened. I said I&rsquo;d be there in a minute, and then Denise&rsquo;s father picked up the extension phone. He reiterated his daughter&rsquo;s request, with even greater urgency. &ldquo;Come up here right away, please. Come up here <i>now</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>I suspected that Denise wouldn&rsquo;t talk to her parents and I would have to intercede, or that she was sick and just wanted to see me. I quickly called another friend to spread the word that the party would have to be canceled, hopped in the car, and raced to her house. I saw people in the kitchen and a lot of activity, and for some reason found this reassuring. Denise&rsquo;s dad opened the door and pulled me in. We walked down the hall &mdash; toward Denise&rsquo;s room, I believed, but he instead pulled me into his office. Before I could ask why, he put his arms strongly on mine and and said, &ldquo;Denise is dead.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>Even Denise&rsquo;s mom,</b> an ER nurse, didn&rsquo;t realize just how desperately ill her daughter was. When she took her to the hospital in the early hours of Dec. 26, she told her husband to go ahead and take the other kids skiing as they&rsquo;d planned. They didn&rsquo;t find out what had happened until they returned home and Denise was already gone.<br /></p><p>A mutual friend returned with me to my apartment, where I stayed up all night telling myself it wasn&rsquo;t my fault. I almost believed it. The next morning we called all of our friends to let them know Denise had died. Here&rsquo;s another thing I&rsquo;m ashamed about: It was actually <i>exciting</i> to be the one dropping this bombshell, like a reporter with an &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; on a breaking news story.</p><p>But after those calls, I felt even worse. Denise&rsquo;s father had asked us not to reveal that she had killed herself, and most of our friends were too shocked to question us. But in many ways Albuquerque is a small town, and within a day or so everyone knew the truth: Denise had overdosed on aspirin. But in my mind, they knew only half the story. By drawing her into my suicidal ideation, Denise had seen self-harm as a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; &mdash; but I truly don&rsquo;t believe she intended it to be permanent. Essentially, I considered myself her killer. I&rsquo;d given her the &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; &mdash; and didn&rsquo;t act when she decided to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>Teenagers grieve loudly, without inhibition, when mourning one of their own. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Teenagers grieve loudly, without inhibition, when mourning one of their own. One of my most distinct memories is of myself wailing on the lawn outside the funeral home before Denise&rsquo;s viewing. I&rsquo;d visited that same funeral home months earlier, when I persuaded a high school friend who worked there to let me take a peek at a dead body after they&rsquo;d closed for the evening. (My obsession with death had no boundaries.)</p><p>Now I was back at that funeral home for Denise&#39;s visitation &mdash; and my friend was working that afternoon, wearing a brown suit and a sympathetic expression as he hugged me. There were tears in his eyes, and I wonder now if this was the first time he had known one of the deceased? When did he find out that it was Denise who was being embalmed there? Did he help her family choose the casket?</p><p>It is pretty horrifying to see the dead body of someone you love, and even more so when you feel responsible for putting them in the casket. When I finally summoned the courage to approach the casket, I gasped with surprise at how lifelike she looked. They had chosen to bury her in her favorite fuzzy sweater and a new pair of jeans she&#39;d received as a Christmas gift. Her hair was styled and her nails were painted crimson &mdash; with the Chanel polish I had given her for Christmas. Her sister, beside me, explained that they had given the mortician the new polish along with her clothes. I reached out to touch her hand but recoiled in horror at how cold and fake it felt. This was the first time I truly realized she was gone.</p><p>I sat with Denise&rsquo;s family at the funeral, clutching her sisters as we sobbed throughout the whole thing. But while they wept for their best friend and role model, my grief was complicated by guilt. I felt like a fraud who had no right to be there, much less seated with her family.</p><p>I stopped eating. If Denise couldn&rsquo;t eat, I wouldn&rsquo;t either. I couldn&rsquo;t tell anyone how I was feeling, so I destroyed my apartment instead. My mother packed up what was salvageable, and I moved into her place. A few days after the funeral, I swallowed all the prescription medication in her medicine cabinet &mdash; but made myself throw it back up because, in a seemingly selfless moment, I didn&rsquo;t want to put her through the agony I was feeling. The truth is that I was simply too messed up to form a coherent suicide plan.</p><p>The next day she took me to a psychiatrist, who said that I should be immediately checked into a mental hospital. Do not pass Go; go directly to what would become my jail for the next few weeks. My mom was to take me there straightaway and return later with a suitcase. It was terrifying, but after all, I felt like I deserved to be locked up.</p><p>I felt safe there. For the first time, I was prescribed antidepressants &mdash; very high doses, because they don&rsquo;t have to be as conservative as they would when figuring out the correct dosage for an outpatient. At first I was furious at my jailers, Dr. Bull and his psychiatric nurse, Donna, whom I saw daily for extended therapy sessions. There was also group therapy, and art therapy, and psychodrama. I had no privacy in my room; nurses checked on me regularly throughout the day and night. I slept a lot. I barely ate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>Based on my history,</b> I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder &mdash; which I&rsquo;m still being treated for today. The antidepressants helped me to feel like a functioning human again. By the end of January, my psychiatrist agreed to let me move into the dorms for the start of the spring semester. I still went to therapy several times a week, and they closely monitored my medication. I had to withdraw from my early-morning classes; my medication was so sedating that I slept at least 10 hours a night.<br /></p><p>Somehow I managed to make good friends with my roommate and her group of friends, and we socialized regularly. (It helped that they were studying to be athletic trainers, so we attended all the jock parties.) I drank heavily and paid for it with violent hangovers &mdash; my medications did not mix well with alcohol. But psychologically, I was starting to feel better. We even went on a spring-break road trip.</p><p>But &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; and <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/12/suicide_rate_season_there_more_suicides_in_spring_and_not_during_the_holidays.html\">springtime</a> can be a dangerous thing when you have suicidal tendencies. It is a myth that most suicides occur during the winter holidays &mdash; Denise, of course, was an obvious exception. In fact, suicide rates often spike in April; T. S. Eliot was right to call it the &ldquo;cruellest month.&rdquo;</p><p>It was UNM&rsquo;s annual Spring Fiesta, and I spent the day basking in the sunshine with thousands of fellow students. I drank for hours, and I was completely wasted when I swallowed antidepressants by the handful at the water fountain outside my dorm room. I&rsquo;d timed it perfectly; both prescriptions were recently filled and the bottles were full. My psychiatrist had finally trusted me enough to prescribe a month&rsquo;s supply rather than just a week&#39;s.</p><p>I have very little memory of what happened next; someone saw me and alerted my roommate, and she and her friends rushed me to the university hospital. They said they could hear me in the waiting room as I screamed and cursed the doctors who were trying to insert a tube down my nose. They pumped my stomach and then gave me activated charcoal to try to absorb the drugs. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;d done a pretty bang-up job and effectively foiled their plans; I very quickly slipped into a coma.</p><p>But it turns out that my friends got me to the hospital just in time. After three days in the coma and some worrisome seizures, I regained consciousness in the ICU. I had very little memory of the preceding week; it took the university police five days to find my car because I had no idea where I had parked it.</p><p>Once I was well enough to move to a regular hospital room, I started writing again in my journal. Here&rsquo;s my first entry from the hospital, dated April 20:</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m alive. It&#39;s hard to write &mdash; I have an IV in my arm. Oh well, I don&#39;t feel like writing anything serious. How I sure wish my memory wasn&#39;t so shot. But that&#39;s life, I guess. Heehee. What is life anyway? I was so close to death. It&#39;s too weird. Like why did I wake up? I mean, if I had died it wouldn&#39;t have hurt or anything. I wish people weren&#39;t so afraid of suicide...and me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>I was mortified</b> that so many people knew what had happened. I got a get-well-soon card signed by most of the football team. Some even visited (the hospital was basically across the street from campus), but it was always awkward. There is nothing in the etiquette books to guide the conversation in this case. I could laugh with my closest friends (my friend Kristie&rsquo;s father had actually flown cross-country to retrieve her from school because they didn&rsquo;t think I was going to make it), and my memory problems offered a good excuse to put off talking about suicide.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>He said I was selfish for not considering how much this would hurt my family.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>One person who didn&rsquo;t shy away from the topic was the pastor of the Lutheran church we&rsquo;d attended infrequently for years. Looking back, I&rsquo;m furious at the things he said when he visited me, but at the time I was vulnerable and obviously not in a position to walk away. In addition to telling me I had sinned against God, he said I was selfish for not considering how much this would hurt my family. (This was not the last time I heard such admonitions; even physicians have chastised me. The ignorance and thoughtlessness of people when it comes to mental health is staggering.)</p><p>Denise&rsquo;s father, on the other hand, absolved me of my sins. I had finally confessed to him that I had failed to act to save Denise, and he insisted when he visited my hospital room that it was not my fault. He told me he had read all my notes and letters to her &mdash; a grieving father&rsquo;s search for &ldquo;answers&rdquo; &mdash; so he knew how fixated I was on suicide and wanted to make sure I didn&rsquo;t die like his daughter.</p><p>We stayed close for a while, but ultimately it just became too painful for me to see anyone from Denise&rsquo;s family. I couldn&rsquo;t separate my guilt from my grief &mdash; and like most people who&rsquo;ve lost loved ones to suicide, they probably were experiencing a similar torment.</p><p>To this day I still feel this was a copycat suicide, in reverse. Denise was psychologically more healthy, and she probably would have ably addressed her problems if she hadn&rsquo;t borrowed my defective tool kit.</p><p>When I was eventually released from the hospital (my recovery was prolonged because I had also contracted pneumonia), I returned to the mental hospital. And I would return there a third time after another suicide attempt. It took years of therapy and constant adjustments to my antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication, but I finally reached a place where I couldn&rsquo;t hear the siren call of suicide. Or at least it is fainter &mdash; farther away and less seductive.</p><p>I am lucky. I have a gloriously happy marriage, family and friends who love and understand me, an exciting and fulfilling career, and a terrific psychiatrist.</p><p>I am still consumed by guilt about my friend&rsquo;s death. And I know that if I killed myself, my loved ones would feel the same way &mdash; to a lesser extent, maybe, but don&rsquo;t all survivors believe there is something they could have, <i>should have</i>, done? But my depression means that I will continue to have those dark days, when my sadness and despair and indescribable <i>pain</i> make it impossible for me to see outside myself.</p><p>Maybe Denise&rsquo;s own suffering was greater than I realized or ever acknowledged. I&rsquo;ll never know. The fact is that I survived, despite my best efforts, and she didn&rsquo;t. The only way I know how to honor her life is to cherish mine. I&rsquo;m doing the best I can.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/19/14/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-mid-23422-1461092230-7.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"100\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /></p><p><br /></p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Drusilla Moorhouse</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/drumoorhouse/my-best-friend-saved-me-when-i-attempted-suicide-but-i-didnt</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:30:08 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">I was serious about killing myself.

I had also been drinking all day, making for a perfectly lethal cocktail.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Make no mistake, this was not a drunken whim.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Just three months earlier, I had been a patient in another medical facility: a mental hospital. My best friend, Denise, had killed herself on Christmas, and days after the funeral I told my mom that I wanted to die too. I couldn&#x26;rsquo;t forgive myself for the role I&#x26;rsquo;d played in Denise&#x26;rsquo;s death: Not only did I fail to save her, but I&#x26;rsquo;m fairly certain I gave her the idea.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Suicide has been part of my identity ever since puberty &#x26;mdash; probably when I developed major depressive disorder, which wouldn&#x26;rsquo;t be diagnosed and treated for another five years. In retrospect, I can acknowledge that I was a popular, attractive, and bright teenager, but my diary entries are peppered with thoughts of suicide and self-loathing. And when Denise and I both had a pregnancy scare (her first time having sex; my second), my &#x26;ldquo;solution&#x26;rdquo; was to gas ourselves in her red Pinto in her garage while her family wasn&#x26;#39;t home. (Our periods were probably late because of our stress about unprotected sex, and synced because we spent so much time together.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But I was the first to make an actual attempt, swallowing 16 tablets of my brother&#x26;rsquo;s prescription medication, writing a short note soaked in tears and bathos, and calling Denise to tell her what I was doing. Of course, she rushed over and told my mother, who called poison control, and Denise and my brother raced to a drugstore to buy ipecac (a popular emetic at the time) while my mom stayed home watching me.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;There was lots of drama and vomiting and attention, which I believe is exactly what I wanted. This was a cry for help, not a serious suicide attempt, and it was answered with ipecac, a visit to a family physician, and, eventually, a therapist.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Still, my fascination with suicide never abated. For my college freshman composition research paper, I evaluated different methods of suicide based on simplicity, cost, and success rate. (I got an A but also an office visit with my concerned professor.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Maybe that&#x26;rsquo;s one reason I felt I could say with such cocky confidence those five words that have tortured me for decades:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Aspirin won&#x26;rsquo;t kill you, Denise.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But aspirin &#x3C;i&#x3E;did&#x3C;/i&#x3E; kill Denise, and I&#x26;rsquo;ve lived with the guilt ever since.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/12/16/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-mid-25772-1460491361-11.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;100&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;It was Christmas,&#x3C;/b&#x3E; and Denise was home again after her first semester away at school. Always the higher achiever, Denise went to the University of Iowa while I enrolled in the local University of New Mexico. Our first semesters were vastly different. I put my head down and earned straight A&#x26;rsquo;s, but Denise &#x26;mdash; like most college freshmen &#x26;mdash; reveled in her newfound freedom, her strict father unable to discipline her from a thousand miles away.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Denise partied, made new friends, and found a new boyfriend, but her grades slipped. She almost failed a class. She dreaded returning home for the winter holiday and confessing the failure to her father. And she was especially excited about road-tripping back to school with her boyfriend, Todd, who planned to drive to Albuquerque so he could meet his new girlfriend&#x26;rsquo;s family. (He did make that trip and meet her family &#x26;mdash; at Denise&#x26;rsquo;s funeral.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Christmas break wasn&#x26;rsquo;t great for either of us. My parents were divorced, and my mom and younger brothers had moved into a cheap apartment while my dad had his own semi&#x26;ndash;bachelor pad at a nearby &#x26;ldquo;disco&#x26;rdquo; complex. I wasn&#x26;rsquo;t on good terms with either of them and was renting my own first apartment while I waited to move into the UNM dorms for the spring semester in January.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On Christmas Eve, while Denise was out with her family, I dropped off my gifts at her doorstep: gourmet popcorn from the store where I had a seasonal job, and a bottle of Chanel nail polish. (She loved doing her own manicures.) I&#x26;rsquo;m sure she gave me something much more thoughtful, but I honestly don&#x26;rsquo;t remember. When I called to thank her, she was morose. Her father had forbidden her from driving back to school with Todd, and she was disappointed that she didn&#x26;rsquo;t receive the gifts she had requested (in particular, a singer&#x26;rsquo;s debut album).&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;I tried calling her back throughout the day and evening, but I always got a busy signal.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;That&#x26;rsquo;s when she told me she had swallowed a bunch of aspirin, and I offered my flip response about its effectiveness. I was actually &#x3C;i&#x3E;annoyed&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. She had a boyfriend, an intact family, and her own bedroom to return to in her middle-class house, and she didn&#x26;rsquo;t have to work crummy part-time jobs to pay for college.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;So I didn&#x26;rsquo;t take her seriously. Aspirin didn&#x26;rsquo;t even rate a mention in my paper about suicide. I expected her to sleep it off, if it had any effect at all, and maybe even have a happy outcome: Her father would be more forgiving about her grades and let her drive back to school with her boyfriend.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I tried calling her back throughout the day and evening, but I always got a busy signal.

I tried her number one last time (still busy) before going to bed. I had to work the next day and prepare for the party she and I were hosting at my apartment that night to celebrate the winter break. Nothing fancy, but it required a certain amount of coordination with our older friends who could legally buy alcohol.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the back of my mind I must have been relieved that I didn&#x26;rsquo;t hear from Denise the next day.

He reiterated his daughter&#x26;rsquo;s request, with even greater urgency. &#x26;ldquo;Come up here right away, please. Come up here &#x3C;i&#x3E;now&#x3C;/i&#x3E;.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I suspected that Denise wouldn&#x26;rsquo;t talk to her parents and I would have to intercede, or that she was sick and just wanted to see me. I quickly called another friend to spread the word that the party would have to be canceled, hopped in the car, and raced to her house. I saw people in the kitchen and a lot of activity, and for some reason found this reassuring. Denise&#x26;rsquo;s dad opened the door and pulled me in. We walked down the hall &#x26;mdash; toward Denise&#x26;rsquo;s room, I believed, but he instead pulled me into his office. Before I could ask why, he put his arms strongly on mine and and said, &#x26;ldquo;Denise is dead.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Even Denise&#x26;rsquo;s mom,&#x3C;/b&#x3E; an ER nurse, didn&#x26;rsquo;t realize just how desperately ill her daughter was. When she took her to the hospital in the early hours of Dec. 26, she told her husband to go ahead and take the other kids skiing as they&#x26;rsquo;d planned. They didn&#x26;rsquo;t find out what had happened until they returned home and Denise was already gone.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;A mutual friend returned with me to my apartment, where I stayed up all night telling myself it wasn&#x26;rsquo;t my fault. I almost believed it. The next morning we called all of our friends to let them know Denise had died. Here&#x26;rsquo;s another thing I&#x26;rsquo;m ashamed about: It was actually &#x3C;i&#x3E;exciting&#x3C;/i&#x3E; to be the one dropping this bombshell, like a reporter with an &#x26;ldquo;exclusive&#x26;rdquo; on a breaking news story.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But after those calls, I felt even worse. Denise&#x26;rsquo;s father had asked us not to reveal that she had killed herself, and most of our friends were too shocked to question us. But in many ways Albuquerque is a small town, and within a day or so everyone knew the truth: Denise had overdosed on aspirin. But in my mind, they knew only half the story. By drawing her into my suicidal ideation, Denise had seen self-harm as a &#x26;ldquo;solution&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;mdash; but I truly don&#x26;rsquo;t believe she intended it to be permanent. Essentially, I considered myself her killer. I&#x26;rsquo;d given her the &#x26;ldquo;weapon&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;mdash; and didn&#x26;rsquo;t act when she decided to use it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;Teenagers grieve loudly, without inhibition, when mourning one of their own. &#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Teenagers grieve loudly, without inhibition, when mourning one of their own. One of my most distinct memories is of myself wailing on the lawn outside the funeral home before Denise&#x26;rsquo;s viewing. I&#x26;rsquo;d visited that same funeral home months earlier, when I persuaded a high school friend who worked there to let me take a peek at a dead body after they&#x26;rsquo;d closed for the evening. (My obsession with death had no boundaries.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Now I was back at that funeral home for Denise&#x26;#39;s visitation &#x26;mdash; and my friend was working that afternoon, wearing a brown suit and a sympathetic expression as he hugged me. There were tears in his eyes, and I wonder now if this was the first time he had known one of the deceased? When did he find out that it was Denise who was being embalmed there? Did he help her family choose the casket?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It is pretty horrifying to see the dead body of someone you love, and even more so when you feel responsible for putting them in the casket. When I finally summoned the courage to approach the casket, I gasped with surprise at how lifelike she looked. They had chosen to bury her in her favorite fuzzy sweater and a new pair of jeans she&#x26;#39;d received as a Christmas gift. Her hair was styled and her nails were painted crimson &#x26;mdash; with the Chanel polish I had given her for Christmas. Her sister, beside me, explained that they had given the mortician the new polish along with her clothes. I reached out to touch her hand but recoiled in horror at how cold and fake it felt. This was the first time I truly realized she was gone.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I sat with Denise&#x26;rsquo;s family at the funeral, clutching her sisters as we sobbed throughout the whole thing. But while they wept for their best friend and role model, my grief was complicated by guilt. I felt like a fraud who had no right to be there, much less seated with her family.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I stopped eating. If Denise couldn&#x26;rsquo;t eat, I wouldn&#x26;rsquo;t either. I couldn&#x26;rsquo;t tell anyone how I was feeling, so I destroyed my apartment instead. My mother packed up what was salvageable, and I moved into her place. A few days after the funeral, I swallowed all the prescription medication in her medicine cabinet &#x26;mdash; but made myself throw it back up because, in a seemingly selfless moment, I didn&#x26;rsquo;t want to put her through the agony I was feeling. The truth is that I was simply too messed up to form a coherent suicide plan.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The next day she took me to a psychiatrist, who said that I should be immediately checked into a mental hospital. Do not pass Go; go directly to what would become my jail for the next few weeks. My mom was to take me there straightaway and return later with a suitcase. It was terrifying, but after all, I felt like I deserved to be locked up.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I felt safe there. For the first time, I was prescribed antidepressants &#x26;mdash; very high doses, because they don&#x26;rsquo;t have to be as conservative as they would when figuring out the correct dosage for an outpatient. At first I was furious at my jailers, Dr. Bull and his psychiatric nurse, Donna, whom I saw daily for extended therapy sessions. There was also group therapy, and art therapy, and psychodrama. I had no privacy in my room; nurses checked on me regularly throughout the day and night. I slept a lot. I barely ate.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Based on my history,&#x3C;/b&#x3E; I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder &#x26;mdash; which I&#x26;rsquo;m still being treated for today. The antidepressants helped me to feel like a functioning human again. By the end of January, my psychiatrist agreed to let me move into the dorms for the start of the spring semester. I still went to therapy several times a week, and they closely monitored my medication. I had to withdraw from my early-morning classes; my medication was so sedating that I slept at least 10 hours a night.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Somehow I managed to make good friends with my roommate and her group of friends, and we socialized regularly. (It helped that they were studying to be athletic trainers, so we attended all the jock parties.) I drank heavily and paid for it with violent hangovers &#x26;mdash; my medications did not mix well with alcohol. But psychologically, I was starting to feel better. We even went on a spring-break road trip.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But &#x26;ldquo;recovery&#x26;rdquo; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/12/suicide_rate_season_there_more_suicides_in_spring_and_not_during_the_holidays.html&#x22;&#x3E;springtime&#x3C;/a&#x3E; can be a dangerous thing when you have suicidal tendencies. It is a myth that most suicides occur during the winter holidays &#x26;mdash; Denise, of course, was an obvious exception. In fact, suicide rates often spike in April; T. S. Eliot was right to call it the &#x26;ldquo;cruellest month.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was UNM&#x26;rsquo;s annual Spring Fiesta, and I spent the day basking in the sunshine with thousands of fellow students. I drank for hours, and I was completely wasted when I swallowed antidepressants by the handful at the water fountain outside my dorm room. I&#x26;rsquo;d timed it perfectly; both prescriptions were recently filled and the bottles were full. My psychiatrist had finally trusted me enough to prescribe a month&#x26;rsquo;s supply rather than just a week&#x26;#39;s.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have very little memory of what happened next; someone saw me and alerted my roommate, and she and her friends rushed me to the university hospital. They said they could hear me in the waiting room as I screamed and cursed the doctors who were trying to insert a tube down my nose. They pumped my stomach and then gave me activated charcoal to try to absorb the drugs. Unfortunately, I&#x26;rsquo;d done a pretty bang-up job and effectively foiled their plans; I very quickly slipped into a coma.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But it turns out that my friends got me to the hospital just in time. After three days in the coma and some worrisome seizures, I regained consciousness in the ICU. I had very little memory of the preceding week; it took the university police five days to find my car because I had no idea where I had parked it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Once I was well enough to move to a regular hospital room, I started writing again in my journal. Here&#x26;rsquo;s my first entry from the hospital, dated April 20:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;So I&#x26;#39;m alive. It&#x26;#39;s hard to write &#x26;mdash; I have an IV in my arm. Oh well, I don&#x26;#39;t feel like writing anything serious. How I sure wish my memory wasn&#x26;#39;t so shot. But that&#x26;#39;s life, I guess. Heehee. What is life anyway? I was so close to death. It&#x26;#39;s too weird. Like why did I wake up? I mean, if I had died it wouldn&#x26;#39;t have hurt or anything. I wish people weren&#x26;#39;t so afraid of suicide...and me.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;I was mortified&#x3C;/b&#x3E; that so many people knew what had happened. I got a get-well-soon card signed by most of the football team. Some even visited (the hospital was basically across the street from campus), but it was always awkward. There is nothing in the etiquette books to guide the conversation in this case. I could laugh with my closest friends (my friend Kristie&#x26;rsquo;s father had actually flown cross-country to retrieve her from school because they didn&#x26;rsquo;t think I was going to make it), and my memory problems offered a good excuse to put off talking about suicide.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;He said I was selfish for not considering how much this would hurt my family.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;One person who didn&#x26;rsquo;t shy away from the topic was the pastor of the Lutheran church we&#x26;rsquo;d attended infrequently for years. Looking back, I&#x26;rsquo;m furious at the things he said when he visited me, but at the time I was vulnerable and obviously not in a position to walk away. In addition to telling me I had sinned against God, he said I was selfish for not considering how much this would hurt my family. (This was not the last time I heard such admonitions; even physicians have chastised me. The ignorance and thoughtlessness of people when it comes to mental health is staggering.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Denise&#x26;rsquo;s father, on the other hand, absolved me of my sins. I had finally confessed to him that I had failed to act to save Denise, and he insisted when he visited my hospital room that it was not my fault. He told me he had read all my notes and letters to her &#x26;mdash; a grieving father&#x26;rsquo;s search for &#x26;ldquo;answers&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;mdash; so he knew how fixated I was on suicide and wanted to make sure I didn&#x26;rsquo;t die like his daughter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;We stayed close for a while, but ultimately it just became too painful for me to see anyone from Denise&#x26;rsquo;s family. I couldn&#x26;rsquo;t separate my guilt from my grief &#x26;mdash; and like most people who&#x26;rsquo;ve lost loved ones to suicide, they probably were experiencing a similar torment.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;To this day I still feel this was a copycat suicide, in reverse. Denise was psychologically more healthy, and she probably would have ably addressed her problems if she hadn&#x26;rsquo;t borrowed my defective tool kit.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;When I was eventually released from the hospital (my recovery was prolonged because I had also contracted pneumonia), I returned to the mental hospital. And I would return there a third time after another suicide attempt. It took years of therapy and constant adjustments to my antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication, but I finally reached a place where I couldn&#x26;rsquo;t hear the siren call of suicide. Or at least it is fainter &#x26;mdash; farther away and less seductive.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am lucky. I have a gloriously happy marriage, family and friends who love and understand me, an exciting and fulfilling career, and a terrific psychiatrist.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am still consumed by guilt about my friend&#x26;rsquo;s death. And I know that if I killed myself, my loved ones would feel the same way &#x26;mdash; to a lesser extent, maybe, but don&#x26;rsquo;t all survivors believe there is something they could have, &#x3C;i&#x3E;should have&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, done? But my depression means that I will continue to have those dark days, when my sadness and despair and indescribable &#x3C;i&#x3E;pain&#x3C;/i&#x3E; make it impossible for me to see outside myself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Maybe Denise&#x26;rsquo;s own suffering was greater than I realized or ever acknowledged. I&#x26;rsquo;ll never know. The fact is that I survived, despite my best efforts, and she didn&#x26;rsquo;t. The only way I know how to honor her life is to cherish mine. I&#x26;rsquo;m doing the best I can.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/19/14/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-mid-23422-1461092230-7.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;100&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"514\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-30695-1460488238-2.png\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"514\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/12/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-mid-14962-1460488385-13.png\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"514\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/12/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-9073-1460491265-3.png\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"514\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/10/enhanced/webdr13/longform-20813-1463062130-7.jpg\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>25 Ways To Trick Yourself Into Eating More Vegetables</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/hide-my-veggies-like-im-five?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>Because voluntarily eating a side of broccoli can be hard.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/6/11/enhanced/webdr07/enhanced-22214-1462547172-4.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"1200\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Alice Mongkongllite / Via BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>You know that vegetables are good for you and full of nutrients.

It&rsquo;s why I clung to daytime reruns of movies starring Jackie Chan, an action star who&rsquo;d made a career out of constantly looking confused, getting punched in the face, and then looking confused about it. One film I remember distinctly was called <i>Who Am I?</i>, in which Chan has amnesia and bumbles around South Africa trying to figure out his identity.</p><p>I guess I could relate to some of that. As a freshman in high school, where did I belong when I didn&rsquo;t have my nose in a Haruki Murakami novel? Who was I supposed to be, exactly? How does one wrestle with that identity when there isn&rsquo;t a single role model who looks like you?</p><p>The answer was a little more literal than I could&rsquo;ve imagined: I joined the wrestling team.</p><p>I walked onto my high school varsity wrestling squad because there was no one else who weighed as little as I did. I was, at the time, 5&#39;3\", 100 pounds, and very weak.</p><p>Skinny and deeply unathletic, I was nervous about joining the team. Coach Santo told me that when he was in high school three decades ago, he was terrified of wrestling Asians. He&rsquo;d had almost no interaction with them, and he was convinced they possessed mystical strength. His xenophobia was weirdly encouraging.</p><p>It also helped that he taught me how to play dirty. This was Santo&rsquo;s advice: Inflict as much pain on your opponent as you can when the referee isn&rsquo;t looking. This meant jabbing thumbs into someone&#39;s ribs or joints, using your bony elbows or knees whenever possible, coming down hard on every bodily soft spot out of eyesight. Perhaps the most brutal iteration of this was wrestling a kid with braces and no mouth guard: You could press on their lips, cutting up the insides of their mouth on their braces. This happened to me a couple times, and it took a long time for the scars inside my mouth to heal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/6/12/enhanced/webdr13/enhanced-mid-10293-1462551528-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"472\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Will Varner / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /></p><p>At practice, we listened to a lot of Rage Against the Machine, the sort of music that is lost on high school boys in private school &mdash; save for the screaming and angst. We had no idea where the anger was coming from or what it meant. Just that it was there.</p><p>The heavyweight on our team &mdash; let&rsquo;s call him Barry &mdash; was enormous and mean. His face was huge, but his features were diminutive and ratlike, resembling something like a prepubescent version of Officer Farva from <i>Super Troopers</i>. I remember his pre-match pump-up speeches, talking about how we were gonna \"fuck these faggots up,\" and how we were gonna \"fuck these faggots in the face,\" which was somehow both intensely homophobic and homoerotic at the same time.</p><p>Even though what Barry was saying was deeply unsettling, I could tell that it came from a place of bodily insecurity. Adolescence is defined by harboring and understanding those fears. Wrestling is an intimate sport. For almost every high school freshman, your first wrestling match is the closest you&rsquo;ve ever been with another human being. Each match is six minutes &mdash; seemingly a lifetime &mdash; of contact with a stranger&rsquo;s flesh and sweat, pressing and pulling on each other until one is worn down from exhaustion.</p><p>But even more daunting than the bodily fears of another is fear of yourself. When you are a teenage boy, you are incredibly self-conscious about your penis. (In fact, some people remain self-conscious about their penises into adulthood, which is why they go into finance and live in Murray Hill.) That preoccupation with one&rsquo;s own dick is compounded when you&rsquo;re an Asian man, constantly confronted with the stereotype that an Asian penis is smaller than average. Even though, rationally, I knew this made as much sense as the idea that Asians were particularly skilled in math or pedicures, what evidence did I have to go on?</p><p>The solution, it turns out, was to get proof.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>Once I saw that my junk looked just like everyone else&rsquo;s, it made me rethink all of the other things I&rsquo;d been told about Asian masculinity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I had never seen as many dicks as I did in the wrestling locker room. (And I haven&rsquo;t since.) It was a strange gallery of people who had gone through puberty early, as evidenced by their pubic hair, and people who hadn&#39;t yet, as illustrated by their lack thereof. And that locker room was where I learned the secret about dicks: They are mostly the same. There is some variance in size and shape, but at the end of the day, all dicks are more similar than they are different.</p><p>The small penis stereotype comes out of a long tradition of believing that Asian men are weak and effeminate, docile and subservient &mdash; all the things that are antithetical to conventional masculinity. The link between penis size and masculinity is, of course, ridiculous and harmful. Like all racial stereotypes, it is a form of oppression.</p><p>But for my misguided teen self, I think it might have had the opposite effect. Once I saw that my junk looked just like everyone else&rsquo;s, it made me rethink all of the other things I&rsquo;d been told about Asian masculinity; maybe all of those were wrong, too. Maybe I had strength and confidence that had yet to be realized.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/6/12/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-mid-12828-1462551554-11.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"258\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Will Varner / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, I got better at wrestling. I thought Santo taught me to play dirty because I wasn&rsquo;t very talented, but over time, it became clear that this is what all good wrestlers did. Still, that didn&rsquo;t prevent me from gaining a reputation: On high school wrestling forums &mdash; a real thing that existed &mdash; I was criticized for using cheap moves. In particular, I used one egregious throw called the head-and-arm, usually considered a desperation move; I would hit this at the beginning of every match.<br /></p><p>I&rsquo;d like to think I was just testing the limits of the sport, that I was the James Harden among the 103-pound wrestlers in the New England Prep circuit, though I might be giving myself too much credit. I qualified for Nationals, which involved Coach Santo driving me eight hours to Lehigh, Pennsylvania, so I could be briskly eliminated from the tournament in 50 seconds.</p><p>My senior year, I was a captain on the varsity team and ranked third in my weight class across the league. But by the time letters of interest for wrestling scholarships came in, I had already decided that I was done. Wrestling had given me a certain kind of confidence, but burdened me with a different kind of insecurity.

In sport, we hurt each other so that we don&#39;t get hurt first. Wrestling had made me very good at that. And while I didn&rsquo;t totally figure out who I was by the end of high school, at least I knew that that was not the kind of person I cared to be. I really just wanted to be that kid reading <i>Norwegian Wood</i>.</p><p>At the end of <i>Who Am I?</i>, the CIA promises to send Jackie Chan all the pertinent details of his life before the memory-erasing head injury. But what&rsquo;s odd is that for all the times he asks &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; throughout the film (which is about a million times &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGH_1A-3bDg\">most dramatically this one</a>), we never actually learn the answer to that question. For all we know, he may never figure it out.</p><p><i>Who Am I?</i> has stuck with me more for its value as a blunt metaphor than its quality as a film. But it&rsquo;s a good reminder that the kind of insecurity I felt &mdash; and feel &mdash; about my own identity is one that never really goes away. It&rsquo;s something to continually wrestle and confront. And maybe, if I keep asking the question, I&rsquo;ll get closer to the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p><i>Kevin Nguyen (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/knguyen\">@knguyen</a>) is a book reviewer based in Brooklyn.</i></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/bodypositivityweek\">Body Positivity Week</a> is a week of content devoted to exploring and celebrating our complicated relationships with our bodies.

But what&#x26;rsquo;s odd is that for all the times he asks &#x26;ldquo;Who am I?&#x26;rdquo; throughout the film (which is about a million times &#x26;mdash; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGH_1A-3bDg&#x22;&#x3E;most dramatically this one&#x3C;/a&#x3E;), we never actually learn the answer to that question. For all we know, he may never figure it out.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Who Am I?&#x3C;/i&#x3E; has stuck with me more for its value as a blunt metaphor than its quality as a film. But it&#x26;rsquo;s a good reminder that the kind of insecurity I felt &#x26;mdash; and feel &#x26;mdash; about my own identity is one that never really goes away. It&#x26;rsquo;s something to continually wrestle and confront. And maybe, if I keep asking the question, I&#x26;rsquo;ll get closer to the answer.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Kevin Nguyen (&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/knguyen&#x22;&#x3E;@knguyen&#x3C;/a&#x3E;) is a book reviewer based in Brooklyn.&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;h2&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/bodypositivityweek&#x22;&#x3E;Body Positivity Week&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is a week of content devoted to exploring and celebrating our complicated relationships with our bodies.

\n\t<p>Which makes sense if you&#39;ve ever thought, <i>Oh, there&#39;s no way that&#39;s fitting up there</i>...and then it did. This process is called vaginal tenting, and it means your vaginal canal literally expands to make penetration more comfortable. </p>\n\n<p>When you&#39;re aroused, increased muscle tension actually helps draw the uterus upward, giving you more space to work with, says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1580055648/?tag=buzz0f-20\"><i>The Coregasm Workout</i></a>.

It&#39;s also acidic, with a regular vaginal pH level between 3.8 to 4.5, which is ideal for keeping that balance of bacteria for good vaginal health. Ironically, all those douches and scented wipes can actually throw off that pH balance and make you <i>more</i> prone to infections and irritations.</p>\n\n<p>That doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t keep the outside area &mdash; your vulva &mdash; clean, but all that takes is some water (if you must use soap, make sure it&#39;s a simple, unscented one with very few ingredients). <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/how-to-actually-clean-your-vagina?utm_term=.oc2v6VnP1#.jfzM2Jez9\">More info on all that here</a>. And if you do notice an unusual odor or discharge or itching, check with your doctor to rule out an infection.</p>\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://theglossdotcom.tumblr.com/post/108285187710/with-naya-riveras-comments-regarding-how-much\">theglossdotcom.tumblr.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Vaginas make their own lube.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/4/13/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-1989-1462384750-2.png\" width=\"589\" height=\"592\" alt=\"Vaginas make their own lube.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Not many other body parts can say that. When you get aroused, more blood flows to your genitals, which cues you to get wet. That lubrication primarily comes through the vaginal walls, though you also get some wetness from the labia minora and from cervical discharge, says Herbenick. </p>\n\n<p>(Keep in mind that lots of things can affect your ability to lubricate &mdash; like birth control, allergy medicines, breastfeeding, and menopause &mdash; so don&#39;t worry if you need to use store-bought lube, too. Totally normal.)</p>\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/look_at_this_pusssy/\">Instagram: @look_at_this_pusssy</a> / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/4Rm8-DiZqq/?taken-by=look_at_this_pusssy\">instagram.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/11-reasons-vaginas-are-fucking-amazing\">View Entire List &rsaquo;</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Casey Gueren</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/11-reasons-vaginas-are-fucking-amazing</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:01:05 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n  <media:description type=\"html\">Other than the fact that they literally bring us LIFE.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">caseygueren</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/18/campaign_images/webdr03/11-reasons-vaginas-are-fucking-amazing-2-6393-1463093431-8.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n</media:content>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>23 Healthy Ways To Eat Peanut Butter For Every Meal</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/24-7-peanut-butter-baby?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>Once a day is never enough.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/3/12/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-14608-1462292745-1.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"1244\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Design by Charlotte Gomez / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>-</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/3/12/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-14540-1462292775-1.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"200\" alt=\"-\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/29/11/enhanced/webdr15/grid-cell-13833-1461942897-4.jpg\" width=\"309\" height=\"463\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://minimalistbaker.com/3-ingredient-peanut-butter-granola-bars/\">minimalistbaker.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/24-7-peanut-butter-baby\">View Entire List &rsaquo;</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Christine Byrne</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/24-7-peanut-butter-baby</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 09:44:51 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">Once a day is never enough.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">christinebyrne</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/9/campaign_images/webdr03/23-healthy-ways-to-eat-peanut-butter-for-every-me-2-4280-1463060686-12.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n  <media:content height=\"1244\" isDefault=\"true\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/3/12/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-14608-1462292745-1.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"200\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/3/12/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-14540-1462292775-1.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Dates, oats, and peanut butter make for a sweet and filling on-the-go breakfast.

It&#x27;s a little too square and stop sign&#x2013;looking for me. I also have a small wrist, so it looks disproportionate.\n\nBlaze bands come in a variety of colors and materials. The default is silicone rubber, and the premium options are metal ($100) and (genuine) leather ($130). Nicole and I were big fans of the &#x22;mist gray&#x22; leather strap.\n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;NICOLE&#x3C;/b&#x3E;: The watch is too aggressively &#x22;masculine&#x22; in my opinion (as in, it&#x27;s not clear that it was made with all genders in mind). Because it&#x27;s so square, it looks like a tiny television on your wrist. When I dressed up in something more formal, it was almost jarring to have on.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"338\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/11/13/enhanced/webdr02/anigif_enhanced-4352-1460397179-3.gif\" width=\"600\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Every time you want to charge the Blaze, you have to &#x3C;i&#x3E;pop out&#x3C;/i&#x3E; the watch face and place it in a charging cradle.

It was light and didn&#x27;t get in the way, but I&#x27;ve had trouble getting the screen to turn on when I want it to. Sometimes nothing happens when I tap, even when it&#x27;s slow and deliberate. It&#x27;s kind of inconsistent. \n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;NICOLE&#x3C;/b&#x3E;: The Alta is sleek. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made, and I loved that the leather band was so soft. It might be the most comfortable wrist-bound wearable tech I&#x27;ve ever tried. Apparently double tapping the bottom of the screen may be the most effective way to turn it on, but I wish the display was less cumbersome. Premium bands are available in leather ($60) and metal ($100); we liked the leather one in graphite (there&#x27;s also blush pink). \n\nIt also doesn&#x27;t make noise against the desk when you&#x27;re typing, which is a &#x3C;i&#x3E;huge&#x3C;/i&#x3E; plus, and is actually comfortable to wear when you sleep.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"200\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/3/20/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-22571-1462323476-11.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"352\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/8/17/enhanced/webdr08/anigif_enhanced-17143-1460151624-7.gif\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">The exercises are provided by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://fitstar.com/&#x22;&#x3E;FitStar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, a popular personal training app. There&#x27;s a guided seven-minute workout, an ab workout, and a simple warmup.

Fitbit can then estimate your stride length based on that run&#x2019;s data. After that first run, it&#x2019;ll be able to calculate your distance and pace even when you aren&#x2019;t using GPS via your phone, but we&#x27;re not sure how accurate it is. If you&#x27;re focused on things like mileage and stats for training, you should bring your device along for complete accuracy.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"310\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/15/17/enhanced/webdr03/anigif_enhanced-1032-1460755582-2.gif\" width=\"550\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Like the Fitbit Charge HR and Surge GPS watch, the Blaze can measure your heart rate. Knowing your heart rate is key if you&#x27;re trying to burn a lot of calories or you&#x27;re training using target heart-rate zones. \n\nOne thing to note is that wrist-worn heart-rate trackers are typically regarded as less accurate than chest-worn monitors. Chest straps are positioned close to your heart, snug against your skin, which is why they may give you a better reading. For wristbands fit is very, very important. To get better accuracy, the watch needs to be very tight on the wrist. \n\nThat being said, both &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.consumerreports.org/fitness-trackers/taking-the-pulse-of-fitbits-contested-heart-rate-monitors/&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Consumer Reports&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-heart-rate-tracking-is-accurate-says-consumer-reports-2210&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Wareable&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; found that Fitbit devices are more or less accurate. During higher intensity workouts, however, the BPMs (heartbeats per minute) were less accurate.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"369\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/9/15/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-5617-1462822492-8.png\" width=\"571\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">The Alta lies somewhere between the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BGO0Q9O/?tag=buzz0f-20&#x22;&#x3E;Fitbit Flex&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N2BVOUE/?tag=buzz0f-20&#x22;&#x3E;Charge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Reminders to Move is a feature that will notify you if you haven&#x27;t taken 250 steps within the hour.

But a lot of people I&#x27;ve talked to seem to like the extra push to walk around and stay active and you can turn them off in the app.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"662\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/29/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-27750-1461972300-5.jpg\" width=\"556\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">SmartTrack, which was introduced in November 2015, is available in all of Fitbit&#x27;s newer devices (the Alta, Blaze, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N2BW638/?tag=buzz0f-20&#x22;&#x3E;Charge HR&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N2BWF6Q/?tag=buzz0f-20&#x22;&#x3E;Surge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;).\n\nBefore SmartTrack, you had to first select the exercise on your tracker or the Fitbit app, then press start to get an accurate reading for calorie burn. The tracker can now recognize when you&#x27;re biking, running, doing the elliptical, participating in a high-movement sport (like soccer or tennis), or doing an aerobic workout (like a bootcamp).\n\nI liked that it automatically took my morning bike commute into account!</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Active minutes are available on every Fitbit device, from the $60 Zip to the $250 Surge.\n\nA goal of mine is focusing on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/quick-cardio-workouts?utm_term=.wm5PwQvMW#.riQZxwRk8&#x22;&#x3E;shorter, more intense cardio workouts&#x3C;/a&#x3E; versus longer, slower workouts during which I&#x27;m barely exerting any effort (and mostly wishing I was eating a giant pile of fries) &#x2014; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/total-body-workouts&#x22;&#x3E;a recent study&#x3C;/a&#x3E; proves that quick, arduous exercise can boost fitness just as much as a longer run, if not more.\n\nThis is why I worked really hard every day to up my &#x22;active minutes,&#x22; which Fitbit awards after only 10 minutes of continuous moderate-to-intense activities. I like that Fitbit stresses that intensity is key &#x2014; it&#x27;s a great reminder not to check out during my workout.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"463\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr06/grid-cell-30440-1462990632-22.jpg\" width=\"309\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"463\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr06/grid-cell-30440-1462990635-27.jpg\" width=\"309\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"418\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/3/21/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-6467-1462326705-1.png\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">One thing I like about the Blaze over the Alta is its heart-rate sensing capability. Heart-rate trackers recognize active minutes for activities like weightlifting or yoga, so you&#x27;re still rewarded for doing non-step-based exercise.\n\nAlso, don&#x27;t get any Fitbit trackers if you&#x27;re expecting to use it while swimming!

Having the notification on my wrist helped a LOT. \n\nThe texts, however, were always cut off &#x2014; and scrolled horizontally because of the limitations of screen size, which means that you need to angle your wrist in a weird way if you want to actually read the text.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">It&#x27;s comfortable enough to wear asleep, and the vibration is muted enough to not disturb your bed bud.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"180\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/3/20/enhanced/webdr14/enhanced-14186-1462323426-1.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"310\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/15/17/enhanced/webdr15/anigif_enhanced-3791-1460755828-2.gif\" width=\"550\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">I don&#x27;t really know if there&#x27;s a customer who&#x27;s deciding between the two because they&#x27;re so different. But I liked seeing texts in full. I liked having heart rate. The display is nice and clear. Plus, it turns on quickly.\n\nOverall, the Blaze worked better. I liked the in-watch Fitstar exercises! Would I buy it? If I did want a smartwatch, it&#x27;s a good way to go. Before the Blaze I wore an Apple Watch, so I had certain expectations of what I wanted the watch to do, but it&#x27;s sufficient if you just want a good way to see texts and calls on your wrist.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/6/17/enhanced/webdr05/enhanced-26075-1462571784-7.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">In truth, it&#x27;s the only wearable I could see myself wearing every day. What I like about the Alta versus other non-heart-rate bands (like Jawbone&#x27;s UP) is that it has a display to see the time.\n\nI was impressed by both of the devices&#x27; battery lives (over a week). The trouble with smartwatches like the Apple Watch is that you have to charge them every night. You only have to charge the Alta (or Blaze) once a week. But ultimately my pick is the Alta because the Blaze is too big and bulky for small wrists. The Alta, on the other hand, is slim and sleek. \n\nI also enjoy the simplicity of it. It&#x27;s so lightweight and the leather band is so soft that I hardly notice I&#x27;m wearing it. Plus, the stainless steel band (pictured here) is glam AF if that&#x27;s what your ensemble calls for. It&#x27;s definitely an upgrade to the Fibit Flex.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"180\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/6/18/enhanced/webdr05/enhanced-26793-1462573983-14.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Steps aren&#x27;t the be-all, end-all solution. Since Fitbit can track sleep and food intake too, you get a more comprehensive look at your health, which can be a good starting point for weight loss. However, you&#x27;ll also need to look closely at &#x3C;i&#x3E;what&#x3C;/i&#x3E; you&#x27;re eating and the &#x3C;i&#x3E;type&#x3C;/i&#x3E; of exercising you&#x27;re doing, which means doing some of your own research. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/the-deal-with-body-fat&#x22;&#x3E;Here&#x27;s an amazing resource&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for everything you need to know about body fat. \n\nIf you&#x27;re already active and want to get even fitter, you&#x27;ll need to work to incorporate more &#x22;active minutes.&#x22; The workouts in the Blaze&#x27;s FitStar apps are pretty basic, so you should supplement them with these &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/quick-running-workouts?utm_term=.qjwomvl1W#.gvJGdPvq3&#x22;&#x3E;quick running workouts&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, or these &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/intense-crossfit-workouts?utm_term=.upLQGRJDv#.tf26w8MKe&#x22;&#x3E;intense bodyweight exercises&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x2014; and having a tracker won&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;ll reach your goal, but can be a good way to keep track of what kind of exercises you&#x27;re doing. Since many of those exercises aren&#x27;t step-oriented, you&#x27;ll also want something with a heart tracker (like the Blaze), which means that the Alta won&#x27;t cut it. \n\nUltimately, if you&#x27;re looking for a fitness tracker to, you know, track long-term trends, the most important advice we can give you is &#x3C;b&#x3E;get a device you&#x27;ll actually wear&#x3C;/b&#x3E;.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"203\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr10/grid-cell-17886-1462991662-4.jpg\" width=\"203\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Jawbone&#x27;s UP3</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"203\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr10/grid-cell-17886-1462991665-9.jpg\" width=\"203\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Misfit Ray</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"203\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr10/grid-cell-17886-1462991667-14.jpg\" width=\"203\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Garmin Vivofit 3</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>6 Women Talk About Keeping Their Body Hair</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/norawhelan/women-talk-about-keeping-their-body-hair?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>&#8220;You can think whatever you want, but it won&#8217;t change what I&#8217;m going to do.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Mariah</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/15/11/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-2333-1460733619-2.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"795\" alt=\"Mariah\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>\"I initially stopped shaving out of laziness, but it didn&#39;t take long for me to realize I found myself sexier and more confident with armpit hair. I don&#39;t necessarily feel the same way about my legs, but it&#39;s still a lot of work, and I have other things to do. I would so much rather spend another hour in bed, or doing something else I enjoy, than shaving.</p>\n\n<p>\"There are situations, like if i&#39;m holding the subway pole above someone who&#39;s sitting, where I avoid eye contact; if they&#39;re disgusted by my hair, I don&#39;t need to know it. But mostly if people mention it, it&#39;s in a positive way. To be honest, I thought it would impact my life more than it has.\"</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Jon Premosch / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Ashley</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/15/11/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-25362-1460733725-10.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"795\" alt=\"Ashley\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>\"When I was 13, I went to the most popular girl in school&#39;s pool party. The other girls there saw my leg and pubic hair, and said my crush wouldn&#39;t like me because of it. I was super confused, so I went to speak to my mom, who told me that I&#39;m human, and I&#39;m beautiful, and if a guy can&#39;t accept me like that, to forget about him.</p>\n\n<p>\"If I meet a new guy and he asks why I don&#39;t shave my legs, I tell him, &#39;<i>You</i> can shave your legs if you want to, but I&#39;m not going to.&#39; I want to tell girls that they shouldn&#39;t feel like they need to fit into the superficial standards society sets. We&#39;re covered in hair because we&#39;re mammals&#33; You just have to do what makes you comfortable.\"</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Jon Premosch / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Meghan</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/15/11/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-2296-1460733807-20.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"795\" alt=\"Meghan\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>\"There wasn&#39;t a big political reason I decided not to shave; I just didn&#39;t want to do it. I think second-wave feminism opened the doors of &#39;It&#39;s OK not to shave&#39; for people like me, but not women of color or trans or gender-fluid people. I&#39;m a white, cis, straight woman who goes to liberal arts school &mdash; my existence is pretty validated and accepted as is.</p>\n\n<p>\"It hasn&#39;t gotten in the way of romantic relationships &mdash; there&#39;s sometimes just kind of an &#39;Ooooooooh&#39; moment, but if you don&#39;t want to kiss me because I have armpit hair, really? There are way more important reasons to choose not to get involved with someone.</p>\n\n<p>\"Anyway, there are plenty of other ways to be a feminist besides not shaving your armpits. Shave or don&#39;t shave; it&#39;s just a choice.\"</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Jon Premosch / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Nicole</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/15/11/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-19296-1460733757-13.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"795\" alt=\"Nicole\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>\"When I was younger, my mom always told me not to shave &mdash; that it wasn&#39;t even worth the bother. She naturally has almost no body hair, so it&#39;s not an issue for her; and when I started growing hair, she was like, &#39;It&#39;s no big deal. It&#39;s fine.&#39; </p>\n\n<p>\"But girls closer to my age had different ideas. My cousins said since I had only a little hair, why not shave it entirely off? In middle school, in the locker room, people would call it gross and ask the same. But it makes me comfortable, so I decided to keep it.\"</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Jon Premosch / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/norawhelan/women-talk-about-keeping-their-body-hair\">View Entire List &rsaquo;</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Nora Whelan</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/norawhelan/women-talk-about-keeping-their-body-hair</guid>\n<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 12:01:05 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n  <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;You can think whatever you want, but it won&#x27;t change what I&#x27;m going to do.&#x22;</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">norawhelan</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/9/campaign_images/webdr11/6-women-talk-about-keeping-their-body-hair-2-31373-1463060646-3.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n</media:content>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>9 Things People With Vaginas Just Don&#x27;t Need To Do</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/augustafalletta/your-vagina-is-beautiful?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>Why is labiaplasty a thing?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>There are no two ways around it: Vaginas are INCREDIBLE.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/6/15/enhanced/webdr05/enhanced-5802-1462563363-1.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"986\" alt=\"There are no two ways around it: Vaginas are INCREDIBLE.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>No one on this planet would be alive without them.

You need to look at other aspects of your life too, like sleep, diet, and workout regimen. Most trackers measure sleep quality (living a healthy life means making sure you&#x27;re getting enough rest) and have food-logging features in their apps. (Jawbone, Fitbit, and Basis all do.)\n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;If your goal is to lose weight, you&#x27;ll also need to look closely at &#x3C;i&#x3E;what&#x3C;/i&#x3E; you&#x27;re eating and the &#x3C;i&#x3E;type&#x3C;/i&#x3E; of exercising you&#x27;re doing&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. This means doing a lot of your own research, in addition to wearing the tracker and making sure you&#x27;re hitting your step goals. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/the-deal-with-body-fat&#x22;&#x3E;Here&#x27;s an amazing resource&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for everything you need to know about body fat.\n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;If you&#x27;re already active and want to get even fitter, you&#x27;ll need to incorporate workouts that get your heart rate up and/or challenge your strength.&#x3C;/b&#x3E; Having a tracker won&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;ll meet your goal, but can be a good way to keep track of what kinds of exercises you&#x27;re doing. Try these &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/quick-running-workouts?utm_term=.qjwomvl1W#.gvJGdPvq3&#x22;&#x3E;quick running workouts&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or these &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/intense-crossfit-workouts?utm_term=.upLQGRJDv#.tf26w8MKe&#x22;&#x3E;intense bodyweight exercises&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Since many of those exercises aren&#x27;t step-oriented, you&#x27;ll probably want something with a heart-rate sensor.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"625\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/10/12/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-12334-1462899545-2.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">It&#x2019;s a complicated question. Virtually none of them are FDA-approved, so they don&#x2019;t have to be as accurate and precise as a medical device. What&#x2019;s more, fitness trackers are constantly changing, usually faster than independent, peer-reviewed, scientific studies can evaluate them, and depending on where they&#x2019;re worn on the body, some devices are better at measuring certain things than others. \n\nCompanies also don&#x2019;t reveal the proprietary algorithms that measure your biometrics, and tend to provide limited access to the data they collect, making their products harder to scrutinize.\n\nFor the thing many people buy them for &#x2014; to track their steps &#x2014; Fitbit and Jawbone are generally reliable, according to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4683756/&#x22;&#x3E;a December review&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of a total of 22 studies inspecting Fitbit and Jawbone devices. In the Fitbit studies, subjects wore the Classic, Ultra, One, Zip, and Flex on different parts of their bodies, while people in the Jawbone studies wore UP and UP24 on their wrists. Fitbit and Jawbone devices were generally very accurate at counting steps, the studies reported overall.\n\nHowever, many of those studies reported that they also underestimated caloric burn. And according to some studies, the devices tended to overestimate moderate to vigorous physical activity, the review authors wrote.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"599\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/10/16/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-5226-1462910757-5.png\" width=\"600\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Customers from California, Colorado, and Wisconsin filed &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10724270/fitbit-lawsuit-charge-hr-surge-incomplete-heart-rate-tracking&#x22;&#x3E;a class-action lawsuit&#x3C;/a&#x3E; alleging that two of the newest devices &#x2014; the Charge HR and the Surge &#x2014; are inaccurate by &#x201C;a significant margin,&#x201D; especially during intense exercise, and don&#x2019;t actually &#x201C;count every beat&#x201D; despite the company&#x2019;s ads about heart-rate tracking. (Fitbit has said that it does not believe the case has merit and it stands by its heart-rate technology.)\n\nBut some doctors find the heart-rate monitoring reliable enough to make judgments &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/fitbit-in-the-hospital?utm_term=.xvv0n797B#.ln8kD7p7r&#x22;&#x3E;in medical situations&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.

If accuracy for this is really important to you &#x2014; which may be the case if you&#x2019;re a hardcore athlete &#x2014; you should probably get a chest strap.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"593\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/10/15/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-9406-1462908988-1.png\" width=\"593\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Unfortunately, there are fewer studies about fitness trackers that are relatively new or less popular. In &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-015-0201-9&#x22;&#x3E;a small study&#x3C;/a&#x3E; published last year, 21 healthy adults went about living their normal lives for two days while wearing two research-grade devices plus seven consumer devices, including the Misfit Shine, Nike Fuelband (RIP), the Striiv Smart Pedometer, and the Withings Pulse. \n\nAfter analyzing how all the devices measured step count, sleep time, and caloric burn, Australian researchers concluded that the Fitbit One, Fitbit Zip, and Pulse were the strongest performers.\n\nWhat about the Basis Band? &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Citation/2014/09000/Validity_of_Consumer_Based_Physical_Activity.20.aspx&#x22;&#x3E;Another study&#x3C;/a&#x3E; tested it in a group of 60 men and women who wore it, plus seven other monitors, while working out for nearly 70 minutes.

In children and adults, Fitbit and Jawbone trackers generally overestimate how much time people spent actually asleep, and underestimated how often they woke up after falling asleep, according to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4683756/&#x22;&#x3E;the December review of nearly two dozen studies&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. \n\nGranted, the trackers were usually tested over one or two nights, and &#x201C;it may be that newer trackers will perform better if they &#x2018;learn&#x2019; when the person is asleep, awake, or napping,&#x201D; the review authors wrote.\n\nFitbit, for its part, notes that you can set your device in &#x201C;sensitive&#x201D; or &#x201C;normal&#x201D; mode when you hit the hay, depending on how detailed you want the data to be. Wearing your tracker consistently with the same setting should produce useful data, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/Sleep-tracking-FAQs&#x22;&#x3E;the company says&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. \n\nLast year, Jawbone released the UP3 (which wasn&#x2019;t included in the studies summarized by the review), which it &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://jawbone.com/blog/up3-deep-dive-into-sleep-tracking/&#x22;&#x3E;claims&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is capable of tracking detailed data like REM cycles and deep sleep.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"611\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/10/16/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-buzz-13473-1462911302-12.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x3C;b&#x3E;Stephanie:&#x3C;/b&#x3E; While the Apple Watch is expensive and has a few more bells and whistles than you&#x27;ll probably ever use, I like it because it tracks my movements, shows me at any given time how much progress I&#x27;ve made so far that day, and easily syncs all the data with the iPhone Health app.\n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;Nicole:&#x3C;/b&#x3E; I really like the Charge HR because it has a great battery life, and I like the Fitbit app more than other brands. It&#x27;s almost one of the slimmest/most comfortable form factors for a tracker with a heart-rate monitor built in.

I imagine this is a cycle that will continue until my soul is released from this mortal coil and my flesh fertilizes a tree I will demand be planted over my corpse.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"309\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/15/enhanced/webdr09/grid-cell-2775-1462996045-4.jpg\" width=\"309\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Kaye Toal</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"309\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/15/enhanced/webdr09/grid-cell-2775-1462996048-9.jpg\" width=\"309\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"160\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/2/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-21919-1462226906-1.png\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Some people find this super motivating.

When I am actively not succeeding, I reach out to a trusted friend for support and I am honest with her about what I&#x27;m feeling and that I need to be reminded that I am not a rotten trash bag filled with hot garbage juice cosplaying as a slime mold. Your friends love you and will be glad to remind you of this, and that means you can also do it for them when they&#x27;re feeling low! Wooooooo!\n\nI also try to catch my negative thoughts about myself and contradict them. This is sometimes very successful, as in when I catch myself thinking, &#x22;My face is disgusting&#x22; and contradict myself with, &#x22;My face is not at all disgusting, I have great eyebrows and eyelashes and lips and skin.&#x22; It is sometimes less successful, as in when I catch myself thinking, &#x22;My face is disgusting&#x22; and contradict myself with, &#x22;Well, I washed it today.&#x22; As long as you&#x27;re pushing against this kind of negative thinking, though, you&#x27;re making important strides and you should be proud of yourself.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"595\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/4/14/enhanced/webdr14/enhanced-20512-1462387862-1.png\" width=\"595\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Someone else is a completely different person, after all, with a completely different genetic makeup, a completely different lifestyle, and completely different goals and priorities.

So, yes, sometimes resisting those beliefs is so much harder than other days. Some days I will not quite be able to fight the good fight. But that&#x27;s OK &#x2014; the process is an ongoing one, and it may last my entire life. It&#x27;s not so much a straight line as a wild squiggle of back-and-forth and up-and-down.\n\nBut it&#x27;s OK. I&#x27;m OK. You&#x27;re OK. We are all ridiculous, incredible, beautiful balls of human emotion cloaked in a body that was given to us by genes and circumstance. Life is too short not to believe wholeheartedly that you are just as incredible, beautiful, and worthwhile as everybody else.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"278\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/6/13/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-6166-1462557217-7.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>15 Awards Everyone Who Struggles With Body Image Deserves</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/annaborges/its-complicated?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>Relationship status with your body: It&#8217;s complicated.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/27/11/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-24425-1461771118-6.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"625\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Anna Borges / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/27/11/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-24681-1461771372-21.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"625\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Anna Borges / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/27/11/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-24520-1461771311-9.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"625\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Anna Borges / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/27/11/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-24546-1461771416-7.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"625\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Anna Borges / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/annaborges/its-complicated\">View Entire List &rsaquo;</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Anna Borges</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/annaborges/its-complicated</guid>\n<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 12:00:08 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n  <media:description type=\"html\">Relationship status with your body: It&#x27;s complicated.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">annaborges</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/15/campaign_images/webdr15/15-awards-everyone-who-struggles-with-body-image--2-544-1462995028-0.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n</media:content>\n</item>\n</channel>\n</rss>",
