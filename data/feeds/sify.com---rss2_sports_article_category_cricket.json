The Englishman has that rare ability to hit good deliveries for massive sixes and that\u2019s what he did to take his team home against the Royal Challengers Bangalore. Along with him was Kieron Pollard who was keen to make up for the expensive over that he had bowled that gave the Bangalore team some hope and he also joined in the mayhem that was savage in its intensity, yet seemed so cool and calculated. <p>A rare failure while chasing for the Mumbai Indians' skipper Rohit Sharma may have given the Mumbai dug out a bit of a jolt but they have the batting depth to overcome most such situations. They had young Krunal Pandya waiting to bat and the left-hander has shown a good appreciation of the faith reposed in him and has delivered regularly with both bat and ball. He was the deserving man of the match too as he got AB de Villiers out just when the South African champion was looking dangerous. All Krunal has to do now is to look no further than home to avoid the mistakes that brother  Hardik seems to have made in losing his place in the team.  </p><p>Mumbai have taken a big step in beating the Bangalore team and the race to the final four spots becomes tighter with every match. The Kings Eleven Punjab has been out of sorts with their star players not delivering when needed. In fact the impression from a distance  that some of them are not even giving it their best may be misleading for no player likes to fail but at the same time some players feel once they have made it to their national teams that the performance in the IPL will not impact their places in the national team and so tend to play bit carelessly.</p><p><img src=\"http://im.sify.com/sifyhome2011/images/apr2016/image_1_300x94apl24.jpg\" align=\"left\"></p><p> There is always a thin line between carefree and careless cricket and the so called aggressive players often get away with careless play because of the image of being an attacking player. The new Punjab skipper Vijay is playing superbly but is not quite getting the support that the team needs to win close games and after that heart breaking one run loss to Bangalore he will have a job on his hands to lift the team. </p><p>Mumbai play at home so they are clearly the favourites with their recent win but the T20 format is such that surprises are round the corner for any team that gets complacent.</p><p><b>Source: PMG</b></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/mumbai-have-taken-a-big-step-to-stay-in-playoffs-race-news-cricket-qfnkTIdcgdfje.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/someone-trying-to-blackmail-me-with-tampered-video-sharjeel-khan-news-cricket-qfmx2Rfijbfjf.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 12 May 2016 23:28:53 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Someone trying to blackmail me with tampered video: Sharjeel Khan]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qfmx2Ibagbjaa.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[Pakistani opener, Sharjeel Khan has claimed that some unknown persons were trying to blackmail him by demanding money for not releasing videos of him which could harm his reputation.<p>Police in Sharjeel\u2019s hometown Hyderabad visited his residence and spoke to his father to inquire about the matter but a senior official said the family had not filed any official complaint as yet with them.</p><p>\u201cNo official complaint has been made by them as yet with us so we can\u2019t move forward.

(ICC), the governing body said on Thursday.<p>Under reforms Manohar himself had initiated within the ICC as its former chief earlier this year, the chairman must be an independent candidate with no formal links to his home board.</p><p>Manohar, who resigned as the president of the powerful BCCI on Tuesday, commenced his two-year term at ICC with immediate effect.</p><p>\"It is an honour to be elected as the Chairman of the International Cricket Council and for that I am thankful to all the ICC directors who have put their faith and trust in my abilities,\" Manohar, 58, said in a statement.</p><p>\"I also take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues in the BCCI who have supported me during my recent time as the BCCI's President.\"</p><p>During his previous ICC stint, Manohar was instrumental in overturning the constitutional changes made in 2014 that gave India, England and Australia almost total control of cricket's administration.</p><p>The ICC full council approved the constitutional amendments which will see the president's post abolished after the governing body's annual conference in Edinburgh.</p><p>A lawyer by profession, Manohar served as BCCI president from 2008-2011 and was re-elected to the powerful position in October 2015 after the death of Jagmohan Dalmiya.</p><p>As BCCI president, Manohar brought significant transparency into the functioning of a board traditionally perceived as an efficient but opaque body.</p><p>\"These are exciting times for international cricket as we are presently carrying out a comprehensive review of the 2014 constitutional amendments which is aimed at not only improving governance structures, but cricket structures as well,\" he said.</p><p>\"The ultimate objective is to grow our sport and engage a whole new generation of fans and I look forward to working with all stakeholders to shape the future of cricket, which has a proud history and rich

said Mumbai Indians benefited as the pitch at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru had eased out in the second half.<p><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/sports/cricket/ipl/\"><b>IPL 2016 - Complete Coverage</b></a></p><p>Mumbai Indians relied on a late assault from Kieron Pollard and Jos Buttler to beat Royal Challengers Bangalore by six wickets in their crucial IPL match and keep their hopes of a play-offs berth alive Wednesday night.</p><p>\"Having lost Virat and Chris early, we had to change the batting strategy. The wicket was a bit slower on the side and it was not easy to go there and start hitting straight away. We discussed in the middle to stick on and build a partnership, and may be after 10 overs decide on a target.</p><p>Unfortunately, AB (de Villiers) got out, but we were happy to have posted 150 odd runs. Obviously, in the second half, the wicket became a little bit easy for batting,\" Rahul said.</p><p>Rahul said he donned the role of an opener when he walked out to bat as Kohli and Gayle were dismissed early.</p><p>Moreover, the team had stressed on flexible batting line-up, which did not click due to the bad start, he added.</p><p>\"That was the plan, and that's what we discussed in the team meeting, to be flexible. Unfortunately, we lost Chris and Virat early, and it wasn't in any way a good start for the team, but I played the role of an opener when I went in to bat early on,\" he said.</p><p>Asked about Gayle, who is struggling for form at the moment, Rahul said, \"In this game, we decided on Chris to open the innings as he is a dangerous batsman, and we all know that. If he fires he can get us 250 runs on any wicket and any ground. But that doesn't happen as always.\"</p><p>Mumbai Indians' Krunal Pandya said he was surprised to have won the Man of the Match as mostly the award goes to a batsman in this slam-bang league.</p><p>\"Yeah (I was surprised) that a bowler got the Man of the Match in this format. However, I am very happy the way I bowled today. Getting a result in our favour was like icing on the cake,\" he said.Replying to a query, Krunal said, \"Actually the wicket was not a normal Bangalore wicket. Today it was on a slower side. The ball was gripping slightly, so when we went into bat our plan was to keep wickets at the back end, and 150 runs target here is gettable because of the smaller size of the ground.\"</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/wicket-was-a-bit-slower-when-we-batted-kl-rahul-news-cricket-qfmloSdfbafic.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/rahman-on-board-as-ioa-goodwill-ambassador-news-cricket-qfmpEejigaefb.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 12 May 2016 10:10:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Rahman on board as IOA goodwill ambassador]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qelslFgidaied.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<p>Music maestro A.R.

Why would I quit a post if I had been angling for it (ICC chairman post)?,\" Manohar told the<i> Times of India</i>. \"I could have continued to be the BCCI president as well as the ICC chairman, and not pushed for a change in the global body to have an independent head.\"</p><p>Manohar added that he had kept his BCCI colleagues in the loop about the move and had sent in his resignation letter to BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur four days before making it public on Tuesday.</p><p>Manohar, who had taken over as the BCCI chief after the death of Jagmohan Dalmiya in October last year for a second stint, admitted that he was not happy in his role. &nbsp;</p><p>\"If you recall, I was not very keen to return to the BCCI for a second stint. After Jagmohan Dalmiya's sudden demise, when board members requested that I lead the BCCI again, I agreed because I felt it was time for me to give back something to the institution that serves Indian cricket.\"</p><p>\"I am not disenchanted with the BCCI, but with the overall scenario. I shared my thoughts with my colleagues over the past couple of months. I must say there was pressure on me to continue but I have never felt comfortable hanging on to any post without contributing significantly,\" explained Manohar.</p><p>\"After taking over as the BCCI president for the second time (in October) I did my best and brought in major changes in the organisation. I feel certain portions of the Lodha panel's recommendations are not in the interests of the board. There is very little I can do in the current scenario. My conscience no longer permits me to continue,\" he said. </p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/i-was-forced-to-resign-says-shashank-manohar-news-cricket-qflpgqgdecdid.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/want-to-watch-azhar-movie-sehwag-news-cricket-qfltudhifecba.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Wed, 11 May 2016 13:50:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Want to watch Azhar movie: Sehwag]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/pfzqI7fdhfbde.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<p>India's batting icon Virender Sehwag said on Wednesday that he is eagerly waiting and looking forward to the release of the film 'Azhar' which is a biopic based on former India cricket skipper Mohammad Azharuddin.</p><p>The film which is scheduled to release on May 13, features Bollywood actor Emraan Hashmi in the lead role as Azhar. The film portrays the life of the former batsman and the controversies surrounding his life and career.</p><p>\"I really want to watch the movie (Azhar) for sure. When the movie is made it is done for people to see it, so I will definitely see it,\" Sehwag said here at the announcement of 92.7 Big FM's Big Catch contest.</p><p>Sehwag, who is currently the mentor for Indian Premier League side Kings XI Punjab, praised newly-appointed captain Murali Vijay as a good leader and hoped that his team will break their recent run of poor performances in the ongoing cash-rich tournament and will do better in the upcoming matches.</p><p>\"We thought that David Miller should not do the captaincy and he should concentrate on his batting. Murali Vijay took the captaincy and we won two games. So there is a quality in Murali who can lead the side and he is a very good cricketing brain. He has changed things for the team and I hope in the coming games he will do well for the side.\"</p><p>After a series of losses, Punjab find themselves at the bottom of the points table and their chances of making it to the play-off stage have already been dashed.</p><p>\"He (Vijay) has got the confidence and now he has scored two fifties after that. He has played enough cricket, he knows what a captain's role is. He knows how to motivate the team,\" Sehwag said.</p><p>\"We took the decision in favour of the team. The team was not doing well. Miller as a captain was under a lot of pressure. He was not performing well as a batsman also, so we thought that if we give captaincy to someone else then he can play as a batsman and score more runs and win games. Everyone took it in a good way an accepted it, no one complained about it, not even Miller. So as a sports staff our duty is to pick the right captain and give him the responsibility. Murali was the right choice.\"</p><p>The 37-year-old also hoped that the team's overseas players Glenn Maxwell, Hashim Amla and Miller will give their best in the upcoming next matches. </p><p>\"There is nothing new in the Punjab squad this time, same as last tie. Last time we were at the bottom of the table, this time also we are at same spot. There were a lot of close matches. We are hoping to do well ahead in the rest four games. We will hope next we will give a better performance,\" he said.</p><p>\"The youngsters in our side, Manan Vohra, Wriddhiman Saha, Axar Patel all are talented players. I have motivated them a lot. We failed to give consistent performances but will hope that Glenn Maxwell, Amla, Miller give their best and help the team win,\" Sehwag added.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/want-to-watch-azhar-movie-sehwag-news-cricket-qfltudhifecba.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/kohli-shouldnt-be-compared-to-tendulkar-sehwag-news-cricket-qflrEgagcddjg.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Wed, 11 May 2016 12:10:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Kohli shouldn't be compared to Tendulkar: Sehwag]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qfimfwfaefghh.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<p>Former India batsman Virender Sehwag said on Wednesday it is unfair to compare batting legend Sachin Tendulkar with current run-machine Virat Kohli.</p><p>India Test skipper Kohli has been in sublime form over the past couple of months for his national side as well as his Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise, Royal Challengers Bangalore.</p><p>The Delhi-born batsman after winning the Man of the Tournament award in the recent World Twenty20, has smashed two centuries in the ongoing ninth edition of the cash-rich IPL tournament and is the leading run-getter with 561 runs.</p><p>\"No one should compare two individuals. People used to compare me with Tendulkar, me with Viv Richards, that's not fair. The era is not same. I don't think we should compare Kohli with Tendulkar,\" Sehwag said here at the announcement of the final winner of the 92.7 Big FM Big Catch contest.</p><p>Sehwag, who is currently the mentor for IPL team Kings XI Punjab, also hailed Kohli as the most dangerous batsman at present.</p><p>\"There are a lot of batsmen.

When BCCI announces it, it will be fair for us to comment ... People want to see day-night Test. We have seen Australia-New Zealand playing a day-night Test.\" </p><p>\"We will also want as a commentator, ex-cricketer, as a public or as a fan of cricket, that day-night eventually happen here and we will go to witness it,\" Sehwag added.</p><p><br></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/kohli-shouldnt-be-compared-to-tendulkar-sehwag-news-cricket-qflrEgagcddjg.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/its-do-or-die-game-for-both-mumbai-bangalore-news-cricket-qflkvyeggehhc.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Wed, 11 May 2016 10:21:24 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA['It's do-or-die game for both Mumbai, Bangalore']]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qezutLjgjdhff.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<p><b>Bengaluru: </b>The reverse game between hosts Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and defending champions Mumbai Indians (MI) here on Wednesday would be a do-or-die battle for both teams in advancing to the play-offs, says Mumbai all-rounder Hardik Pandya.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/sports/cricket/ipl/\"><b>IPL 2016 - Complete Coverage</b></a></p><p>\"Pressure is on both of us. We know that it's going to be a do-or-die match, as the team that loses would have less hope of making it to play-offs,\" he told reporters on Tuesday ahead of the league tie at the Chinnaswamy stadium.</p><p>Though Mumbai is ahead in the points table at fifth place with 10 points from 5 wins in 10 games, the home team is at sixth place with 8 points from 4 wins in 9 games and has a better net run rate (NRR) -- +0.032 than -0.447 of the former.</p><p>\"Let us see who takes the pressure and comes out winning. Obviously, RCB is a side that looks good and confident, especially on its home turf. But pressure will be on them as well,\" the Baroda lad said before going into a two-hour practice session.</p><p>A win for two-time titleholders Mumbai will propel them back into the top four while RCB will displace it if it maintains the winning streak from the two previous games, including one here over Pune Rising Supergiants on May 7 and a thrilling 1-run victory over Kings XI Punjab at Mohali on Monday.</p><p>With home advantage, RCB will also look for avenging its 6-wicket loss to Mumbai on April 20 in Mumbai and cash-in on its good form while Mumbai is coming after a 85-run humiliating loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad at Visakhapatnam on May 8.</p><p>\"We don't think much about the result of the last game as whatever happened is a part of history. We are looking forward to the Bangalore match on the morrow. We would like to play as good as possible and are preparing for it,\" said Pandya.</p><p>Acknowledging that RCB had powerful batsmen like A.B. de Villiers and Virat Kohli, he said bowlers like him would have to be positive of their ability and prepare to face them with confidence.</p><p>\"We have to be ready for everything as bowlers. But it would not be wise to give away 40 runs in 4 overs, which will work against us. We cannot be complacent against star players like AB or Virat. We have to wait for them to make mistakes than struggle to bowl them out,\" said the right-arm medium pacer.</p><p>Asked if his team has specific plans to contain Kolhi, de Villiers and Chris Gayle from going after bowlers on a strong batting ground, Pandya said their plan was to be on top of the game by giving their best in bowling and fielding.</p><p>\"We all know how good RCB is a batting unit. Our bowlers, including me need to be on top of the game. That's how we cope with the batting challenge of rival teams with a plan and scheme to win over. We also need to remain positive,\" he added.</p><p> </p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/its-do-or-die-game-for-both-mumbai-bangalore-news-cricket-qflkvyeggehhc.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/srinivasan-was-honest-enemy-manohar-backstabber-news-cricket-qfljJ6dijjhec.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Wed, 11 May 2016 09:45:32 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA['Srinivasan was honest enemy, Manohar backstabber']]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/pj1mVtacaiehf.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<b>New Delhi:</b> The petitioner in IPL spot-fixing case Aditya Verma has termed outgoing BCCI president Shashank Manohar as a \"power hungry backstabber\", who has failed to keep his promise of cleaning up the game.<p>A peeved Verma went to the extent of saying that atleast former president and Tamil Nadu strongman N Srinivasan was a man who would \"fight manfully against his foes in an honest manner.\"</p><p>\"Shashank Manohar's latest move to go to ICC shows that he is a power-hungry official. When he was not in power, he spoke about cleansing the game and now he is leaving BCCI without completing his job. Also he is a man who believes in back-stabbing as he and his group used me in their battle against N Srinivasan and then backstabbed without fulfilling promises,\" an angry Verma told PTI today.</p><p>He felt that atleast Srinivasan, whatever his intentions might be was \"Man enough\" to do it in front of everyone and never broke the trust of his allies.</p><p>\"Srinivasan dusmani bhi shaan se kartaa thaa aur apne doston ko kabhi dhokha naahin diya. (Srinivasan maintained his enemity with honesty and never ditched his friends). For Manohar, promises meant nothing. I understood that when with help of Ratnakar Shetty I was thrown out of the BCCI office, it was Manohar behind the move. I had made numerous complaints about Shetty and that fell on deaf ears,\" said Verma.</p><p>Having been dumped by all who had once allegedly used him as their front in their bid to oust N Srinivasan, Verma's only hope now is the Supreme Court of India.

Does he have it in him to go for another four years? Do the selectors think he has got in him to go another four years and be captain of a country for 13 years and take them to the 2019 World Cup? I am not so sure. That's the decision selectors will have to make.\"</p><p>However, Ganguly brushed aside Dhoni's present struggles with his new IPL team - Rising Pune Supergiants.</p><p>\"My point is more than what Dhoni's form is in the IPL or Dhoni's captaincy form is in the IPL, it's immaterial,\" Ganguly said.\"To be honest, he has come under fire but that's because he has gone to a new franchise, new team. His side has not been the same as it has been before with the Chennai Super Kings. You got to take that into consideration,\" added Ganguly.</p><p>Ganguly feels Dhoni would struggle to continue for the next four years.\"My point is that what selectors need to think is that three years down the line or four years down the line when the World Cup is going to happen, do they see MS Dhoni as captain of India. Does he have the ability in the next four years to see India into that World Cup in 2019? He has already given up Test cricket.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Virat Kohli  has done remarkably well as India's Test captain both at home and away.</p><p>\"Coming to Virat Kohli, he has been exceptional. He is one of the best in the world at the moment. Whatever you have seen him as a Test captain, he has been phenomenal,\" signed off the Bengal Tiger.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/sports/ganguly-questions-dhonis-future-as-india-captain-news-cricket-qfkmKHigaidbj.html]]></link></item></channel></rss>",
