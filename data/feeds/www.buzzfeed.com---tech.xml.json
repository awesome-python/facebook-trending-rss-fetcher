To truly ensure an open discussion, free from anonymous sources, it could release the curators from their NDAs. So far, it hasn&#39;t been willing to do that.</p><p>When asked if it would free Trending editors from the agreements it put into place that now prevent them from talking, Facebook declined to comment.</p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Alex Kantrowitz</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/facebook-legal-agreements-muzzle-news-curators-on-accusation</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:02:25 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">Facebook targets anonymous &#x22;Trending&#x22; sources while keeping them under NDA.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">alexkantrowitz</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/18/campaign_images/webdr08/facebook-legal-agreements-muzzle-news-curators-on-2-29010-1463093669-1.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n  <media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/16/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-15639-1463085022-5.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;405&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Reuters&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Facebook has the ability to clear up much of the controversy surrounding allegations of bias in its Trending section simply by releasing its Trending stories staff from the legal agreements currently preventing them from speaking openly about their roles.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Instead, in defending itself, Facebook has repeatedly tried to discredit the accusations by pointing to an untrustworthy bogeyman: anonymous sources.

And the NDAs are designed to be scary.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I remember feeling pretty intimidated by the NDA,&#x26;rdquo; the former curator told BuzzFeed News. &#x26;ldquo;I don&#x26;rsquo;t think I&#x26;rsquo;ve ever signed an NDA like that.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Facebook could stand to benefit from releasing its curators from their NDAs. Our source said they did nothing to bias the Trending column and had no reason to believe colleagues did either. The statement would be more powerful with a name attached, but Facebook is standing in the way of that.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Since the accusations of bias first surfaced in a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Gizmodo&#x3C;/i&#x3E; story&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, contradictory reports on how the Trending column really works have bounced around the media &#x26;mdash; including a story published in &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Guardian&#x3C;/i&#x3E; today that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/full-trending-review-guidelines.pdf&#x22;&#x3E;seems to contradict&#x3C;/a&#x3E; a statement from Facebook VP Tom Stocky claiming that human editors didn&#x26;#39;t artificially insert topics into the Trending column.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Facebook could clear up much of this confusion by allowing its Trending editors, past and present, to go on the record. To truly ensure an open discussion, free from anonymous sources, it could release the curators from their NDAs. So far, it hasn&#x26;#39;t been willing to do that.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;When asked if it would free Trending editors from the agreements it put into place that now prevent them from talking, Facebook declined to comment.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"405\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/16/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-15639-1463085022-5.jpg\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>No, Apple Isn&#x27;t Going To Stop Selling Music Downloads On iTunes</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/brendanklinkenberg/no-apple-isnt-going-to-stop-selling-music-downloads-on-itune?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/21/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-25528-1463015413-8.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"597\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Ian Waldie / Getty Images</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has no plans to stop selling music downloads from iTunes in the next few years.</p><p>\"This is not true,\" Apple spokesperson Tom Neumayr told to BuzzFeed News, rebutting to a Digital Music News <a href=\"http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2016/05/11/apple-terminating-music-downloads-two-years/\">report</a> claiming the company \"is now preparing to completely terminate music download offerings on the iTunes Store\" in two years -- or possibly \"the next 3-4 years.\"</p><p>Closing the iTunes Store &mdash; Apple&#39;s primary music marketplace &mdash; would be an aggressive move under any circumstances.

On Wednesday morning FBI Director James Comey <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-comey-idUSKCN0Y2273\">loudly proclaimed he expects to clash with technology companies like Apple</a> in future court battles over encryption. Then, just hours later, Manhattan&rsquo;s top prosecutor urged Congress to settle the encryption issue with a new law, a move that could reshape the market for American mobile devices and messaging apps, as well as the privacy of the people who use them.</p><p>Cyrus Vance, the District Attorney of New York County and one of the most vocal opponents of robust consumer encryption, believes lawmakers shouldn&rsquo;t wait for potential encryption cases to wind their way through the courts. Instead, with urgency, he is lobbying members of Congress to support legislation that would force tech companies to maintain the ability to decrypt the data of their consumers on demand, with a judge&rsquo;s approval.</p><p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re doing is talking to political leaders,&rdquo; Vance told a Washington audience at the Council on Foreign Relations Wednesday evening. &ldquo;To try and convince them that they should address this with federal legislation. I think that has to be the solution.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/10/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-buzz-26089-1463063656-7.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"409\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Dado Ruvic / Reuters</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>For companies like Apple and WhatsApp, default end-to-end encryption, a feature that allows only the intended recipients to read messages, enhances the security of their devices and services, protecting private, personal data from thieves and malicious hackers. With such encryption measures in place, not even the companies who build these devices and services have access to the secure data stored on them.</p><p>But for Vance, strong encryption creates &ldquo;warrant-proof devices&rdquo; &mdash; a space in which criminals can conspire and do harm without fear of being monitored by law enforcement. Vance believes default consumer encryption denies police and prosecutors a wealth of electronic evidence essential to building cases against suspects.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>Vance said that his office possesses 230 Apple devices that remain locked and inaccessible to law enforcement, in cases including homicide and child abuse.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We now live in a world where we are not getting all the facts,&rdquo; Vance argued Wednesday evening. &ldquo;Many of the facts are on smartphones, because criminals, just like you and me, have moved off paper and onto digital devices.&rdquo;</p><p>Vance said that his office possesses 230 Apple devices that remain locked and inaccessible to law enforcement, in cases including homicide and child abuse. That number has jumped, since February, when Vance reported that <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/maryanngeorgantopoulos/manhattan-district-attorney-cant-access-175-apple-devices-be?utm_term=.jpVGyzW3M#.gc9AXPQY4\">175 Apple devices</a> were inaccessible to his office. Gaining lawful access to encrypted devices should be similar to other types of government searches &mdash; of homes, cars, and safety deposit boxes &mdash; he said. But even with a court order, Apple cannot produce in a readable format the information contained in its most current iPhones and operating systems.</p><p>In an unprecedented move that captured the nation&rsquo;s attention earlier this year, the FBI and the Justice Department attempted to force Apple to help investigators bypass the encryption on an iPhone 5c used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists. In February, the government sought a court order compelling Apple to design new security-suppressing software to defeat its own encryption. Apple challenged the Justice Department in court, however, arguing that the software would undermine the security of millions of iPhone customers. The case was ultimately resolved, but not truly settled, as an unidentified outside party <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/fbi-accessed-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone-without-apple-dr\">showed the FBI</a> how to penetrate the device, prompting the government to withdraw its case against Apple.</p><p>Relying on <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/hamzashaban/fbi-says-bolstering-its-own-capability-to-crack-encrypted-de?utm_term=.mnQXdL601#.uhpXVZ8BW\">outside hackers</a> to help the government crack encrypted devices is unworkable, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-vance-congress-act-on-iphones-20160511-story.html\">Vance has said</a>, both in cost, and because of the sheer number of devices from which the government seeks data.

On Wednesday morning FBI Director James Comey &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-comey-idUSKCN0Y2273&#x22;&#x3E;loudly proclaimed he expects to clash with technology companies like Apple&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in future court battles over encryption. Then, just hours later, Manhattan&#x26;rsquo;s top prosecutor urged Congress to settle the encryption issue with a new law, a move that could reshape the market for American mobile devices and messaging apps, as well as the privacy of the people who use them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Cyrus Vance, the District Attorney of New York County and one of the most vocal opponents of robust consumer encryption, believes lawmakers shouldn&#x26;rsquo;t wait for potential encryption cases to wind their way through the courts. Instead, with urgency, he is lobbying members of Congress to support legislation that would force tech companies to maintain the ability to decrypt the data of their consumers on demand, with a judge&#x26;rsquo;s approval.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;What we&#x26;rsquo;re doing is talking to political leaders,&#x26;rdquo; Vance told a Washington audience at the Council on Foreign Relations Wednesday evening. &#x26;ldquo;To try and convince them that they should address this with federal legislation. I think that has to be the solution.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/10/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-buzz-26089-1463063656-7.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;409&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Dado Ruvic / Reuters&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;For companies like Apple and WhatsApp, default end-to-end encryption, a feature that allows only the intended recipients to read messages, enhances the security of their devices and services, protecting private, personal data from thieves and malicious hackers. With such encryption measures in place, not even the companies who build these devices and services have access to the secure data stored on them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But for Vance, strong encryption creates &#x26;ldquo;warrant-proof devices&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;mdash; a space in which criminals can conspire and do harm without fear of being monitored by law enforcement. Vance believes default consumer encryption denies police and prosecutors a wealth of electronic evidence essential to building cases against suspects.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;Vance said that his office possesses 230 Apple devices that remain locked and inaccessible to law enforcement, in cases including homicide and child abuse.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;We now live in a world where we are not getting all the facts,&#x26;rdquo; Vance argued Wednesday evening. &#x26;ldquo;Many of the facts are on smartphones, because criminals, just like you and me, have moved off paper and onto digital devices.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Vance said that his office possesses 230 Apple devices that remain locked and inaccessible to law enforcement, in cases including homicide and child abuse. That number has jumped, since February, when Vance reported that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/maryanngeorgantopoulos/manhattan-district-attorney-cant-access-175-apple-devices-be?utm_term=.jpVGyzW3M#.gc9AXPQY4&#x22;&#x3E;175 Apple devices&#x3C;/a&#x3E; were inaccessible to his office. Gaining lawful access to encrypted devices should be similar to other types of government searches &#x26;mdash; of homes, cars, and safety deposit boxes &#x26;mdash; he said. But even with a court order, Apple cannot produce in a readable format the information contained in its most current iPhones and operating systems.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In an unprecedented move that captured the nation&#x26;rsquo;s attention earlier this year, the FBI and the Justice Department attempted to force Apple to help investigators bypass the encryption on an iPhone 5c used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists. In February, the government sought a court order compelling Apple to design new security-suppressing software to defeat its own encryption. Apple challenged the Justice Department in court, however, arguing that the software would undermine the security of millions of iPhone customers. The case was ultimately resolved, but not truly settled, as an unidentified outside party &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/fbi-accessed-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone-without-apple-dr&#x22;&#x3E;showed the FBI&#x3C;/a&#x3E; how to penetrate the device, prompting the government to withdraw its case against Apple.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Relying on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/hamzashaban/fbi-says-bolstering-its-own-capability-to-crack-encrypted-de?utm_term=.mnQXdL601#.uhpXVZ8BW&#x22;&#x3E;outside hackers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to help the government crack encrypted devices is unworkable, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-vance-congress-act-on-iphones-20160511-story.html&#x22;&#x3E;Vance has said&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, both in cost, and because of the sheer number of devices from which the government seeks data. Since October of last year, the FBI has examined 4,000 devices, and roughly 500 of those remain locked, according to the agency&#x26;rsquo;s chief, James Comey.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But critics of encryption legislation point to the risks that weaker security features would pose to the public, and to the global nature of encryption technology.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;The U.S. has no monopoly on the technology,&#x26;rdquo; said Adam Segal, director of the Council on Foreign Relations cyber and digital program. &#x26;ldquo;Even if we were to [decide] that we are going to ban certain types of encryption, it will be developed in other places.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Michael Chertoff, the former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who founded his own security consulting firm, also believes encryption legislation is misguided. &#x26;ldquo;Maybe it should be impossible to delete your email,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x26;ldquo;Maybe there should be a rule that you can never shred a piece of paper.&#x26;rdquo; Chertoff described the current debate over encrypted communication as just the latest &#x26;ldquo;species of a problem&#x26;rdquo; related to law enforcement&#x26;rsquo;s legitimate need to collect evidence.

Multiple reports last month declared that the volume of \"original sharing\" &mdash; i.e. content people post on their own instead of simply regurgitating others&#39; via the &#39;share&#39; button &mdash; is falling on Facebook.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/mark-zuckerberg-addresses-sharing-decline-reports-as-faceboo\">Original sharing is a serious issue for Facebook</a> since its core product, News Feed, literally runs on the content published to it. If people post less there, it opens up the door to social competitors to flank the company.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Snapchat was prominently listed as an alternative posting destination. The threshold to post is much lower on Snapchat thanks its disappearing content feature.</p><p>Here&#39;s the full survey along with a bit of commentary:</p><h1>Question 1: Would you post something like this now?</h1>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-13513-1462997175-11.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"485\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook didn&#39;t pick a popular post for this survey, or even a particularly interesting one. Instead, it chose a low-effort post I dropped on a friend&#39;s wall for his birthday. Whenever I visit Facebook&#39;s &#39;On This Day&#39; feature, I&#39;m reminded of how often I used to post these simple one-liners (and not just for special occasions). Now, I&#39;m careful to only post when I&#39;ve got something good.

Multiple reports last month declared that the volume of &#x22;original sharing&#x22; &#x26;mdash; i.e. content people post on their own instead of simply regurgitating others&#x26;#39; via the &#x26;#39;share&#x26;#39; button &#x26;mdash; is falling on Facebook.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/mark-zuckerberg-addresses-sharing-decline-reports-as-faceboo&#x22;&#x3E;Original sharing is a serious issue for Facebook&#x3C;/a&#x3E; since its core product, News Feed, literally runs on the content published to it. If people post less there, it opens up the door to social competitors to flank the company.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Not surprisingly, Snapchat was prominently listed as an alternative posting destination. The threshold to post is much lower on Snapchat thanks its disappearing content feature.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Here&#x26;#39;s the full survey along with a bit of commentary:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Question 1: Would you post something like this now?&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-13513-1462997175-11.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;485&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Facebook didn&#x26;#39;t pick a popular post for this survey, or even a particularly interesting one. Instead, it chose a low-effort post I dropped on a friend&#x26;#39;s wall for his birthday. Whenever I visit Facebook&#x26;#39;s &#x26;#39;On This Day&#x26;#39; feature, I&#x26;#39;m reminded of how often I used to post these simple one-liners (and not just for special occasions). Now, I&#x26;#39;m careful to only post when I&#x26;#39;ve got something good. So it&#x26;#39;s no surprise Facebook chose to query me about a post like this.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Question 2: But why?&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/16/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-mid-17035-1462997637-1.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;187&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;I answered that I would share a similar post now &#x26;mdash; after all, it was a birthday wish.

This week the company released a list of its <a href=\"https://media.fb.com/2016/05/10/most-popular-360-videos-on-facebook-2016/\">most popular 360-degree videos</a> to date, most of which had over 10,000,000 views. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/abcnews/videos/10154068281383812/\">most popular</a> &mdash; which was calculated by time watched, not by total views &mdash; hit 18,000,000 views.</p><p>However, what becomes clear after looking at the list of the most popular 360-degree videos on the platform is that there is no content from, well, normal people.</p><p>Media companies like ABC and sports teams like FC Barcelona dominate the charts. That is in part because uploading 360-degree video is not the simplest process. It requires a 360-degree camera to capture, which typically cost at least a few hundred dollars, or tens of thousands for a higher quality alternative. 360-degree photos lower the barrier for most people to begin uploading 360-degree imagery of their own, because 360-degree photos can be shot using only a phone.</p><p>\"You can take a panorama and upload that, or use a specialized 360 photo app,\" said Eugene Wei, Oculus&#39; Head of Video.</p><p>Like Facebook&#39;s 360-degree video, 360-degree photos will primarily live on the News Feed. They will display as still images until the viewer moves the phone or mouse around to look around the picture. Additionally, the photos will be able to be viewed by strapping on a virtual reality headset like the Samsung Gear VR or Oculus Rift.<br /></p><p>According to Max Cohen, Oculus&#39; Head of Mobile, Facebook has no immediate plans to extend 360-degree content, either photos or videos, to Instagram.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of ways to shoot 360-degree content on mobile, most notably from Facebook&#39;s primary competitor in the race to dominate virtual reality: Google. Last year, Google launched an app called Cardboard Camera that lets anyone with an Android handset to shoot a 360-degree photograph. To use it, all the photographer has to do is take a panorama-style photo by moving in a full circle. The app works great, but the photos are only viewable in Google&#39;s Cardboard viewer, and sharing is difficult. Facebook&#39;s addition of 360-degree photos to its app is the first time the format will have an opportunity to become a truly mainstream medium.</p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Brendan Klinkenberg</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/brendanklinkenberg/facebook-adding-360-degree-photos-so-you-can-roll-your-own-v</guid>\n<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 13:31:03 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">The user-friendly successor to 360-degree video is on its way to News Feed, but nothing&#x27;s set for Instagram yet.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">brendanklinkenberg</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/12/campaign_images/webdr04/facebook-adding-360-degree-photos-so-you-can-roll-2-2989-1462985382-7.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n  <media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/12/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-mid-7807-1462985068-1.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;1432&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;In its campaign to become the go-to platform for interactive and VR content, Facebook will begin rolling out 360-degree photos later this month, according to Oculus executives.

It requires a 360-degree camera to capture, which typically cost at least a few hundred dollars, or tens of thousands for a higher quality alternative. 360-degree photos lower the barrier for most people to begin uploading 360-degree imagery of their own, because 360-degree photos can be shot using only a phone.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;You can take a panorama and upload that, or use a specialized 360 photo app,&#x22; said Eugene Wei, Oculus&#x26;#39; Head of Video.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Like Facebook&#x26;#39;s 360-degree video, 360-degree photos will primarily live on the News Feed. They will display as still images until the viewer moves the phone or mouse around to look around the picture. Additionally, the photos will be able to be viewed by strapping on a virtual reality headset like the Samsung Gear VR or Oculus Rift.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;According to Max Cohen, Oculus&#x26;#39; Head of Mobile, Facebook has no immediate plans to extend 360-degree content, either photos or videos, to Instagram.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Currently, there are a number of ways to shoot 360-degree content on mobile, most notably from Facebook&#x26;#39;s primary competitor in the race to dominate virtual reality: Google. Last year, Google launched an app called Cardboard Camera that lets anyone with an Android handset to shoot a 360-degree photograph. To use it, all the photographer has to do is take a panorama-style photo by moving in a full circle. The app works great, but the photos are only viewable in Google&#x26;#39;s Cardboard viewer, and sharing is difficult. Facebook&#x26;#39;s addition of 360-degree photos to its app is the first time the format will have an opportunity to become a truly mainstream medium.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>We Tried Fitbit&#x27;s New Blaze And Alta Trackers &#x2014; And This Is What Happened</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolenguyen/fitbit-alta-blaze-review?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>~smarts vs. style~</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/8/17/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-13263-1460151605-1.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"834\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Alice Mongkongllite / BuzzFeed</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Hi!

It&#x27;s a little too square and stop sign&#x2013;looking for me. I also have a small wrist, so it looks disproportionate.\n\nBlaze bands come in a variety of colors and materials. The default is silicone rubber, and the premium options are metal ($100) and (genuine) leather ($130). Nicole and I were big fans of the &#x22;mist gray&#x22; leather strap.\n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;NICOLE&#x3C;/b&#x3E;: The watch is too aggressively &#x22;masculine&#x22; in my opinion (as in, it&#x27;s not clear that it was made with all genders in mind). Because it&#x27;s so square, it looks like a tiny television on your wrist. When I dressed up in something more formal, it was almost jarring to have on.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"338\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/11/13/enhanced/webdr02/anigif_enhanced-4352-1460397179-3.gif\" width=\"600\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Every time you want to charge the Blaze, you have to &#x3C;i&#x3E;pop out&#x3C;/i&#x3E; the watch face and place it in a charging cradle. There are no magnets to help guide the watch into place, so it slides around precariously until you snap the lid shut.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"310\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/15/19/enhanced/webdr09/anigif_enhanced-29577-1460761518-7.gif\" width=\"550\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x3C;b&#x3E;STEPHANIE&#x3C;/b&#x3E;: I really like how thin it is, and how much the Alta looks like a bracelet. It was light and didn&#x27;t get in the way, but I&#x27;ve had trouble getting the screen to turn on when I want it to. Sometimes nothing happens when I tap, even when it&#x27;s slow and deliberate. It&#x27;s kind of inconsistent. \n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;NICOLE&#x3C;/b&#x3E;: The Alta is sleek. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made, and I loved that the leather band was so soft. It might be the most comfortable wrist-bound wearable tech I&#x27;ve ever tried. Apparently double tapping the bottom of the screen may be the most effective way to turn it on, but I wish the display was less cumbersome. Premium bands are available in leather ($60) and metal ($100); we liked the leather one in graphite (there&#x27;s also blush pink). \n\nIt also doesn&#x27;t make noise against the desk when you&#x27;re typing, which is a &#x3C;i&#x3E;huge&#x3C;/i&#x3E; plus, and is actually comfortable to wear when you sleep.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"200\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/3/20/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-22571-1462323476-11.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"352\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/8/17/enhanced/webdr08/anigif_enhanced-17143-1460151624-7.gif\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">The exercises are provided by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://fitstar.com/&#x22;&#x3E;FitStar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, a popular personal training app. There&#x27;s a guided seven-minute workout, an ab workout, and a simple warmup.

Fitbit can then estimate your stride length based on that run&#x2019;s data. After that first run, it&#x2019;ll be able to calculate your distance and pace even when you aren&#x2019;t using GPS via your phone, but we&#x27;re not sure how accurate it is. If you&#x27;re focused on things like mileage and stats for training, you should bring your device along for complete accuracy.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"310\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/15/17/enhanced/webdr03/anigif_enhanced-1032-1460755582-2.gif\" width=\"550\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Like the Fitbit Charge HR and Surge GPS watch, the Blaze can measure your heart rate. Knowing your heart rate is key if you&#x27;re trying to burn a lot of calories or you&#x27;re training using target heart-rate zones. \n\nOne thing to note is that wrist-worn heart-rate trackers are typically regarded as less accurate than chest-worn monitors. Chest straps are positioned close to your heart, snug against your skin, which is why they may give you a better reading. For wristbands fit is very, very important. To get better accuracy, the watch needs to be very tight on the wrist. \n\nThat being said, both &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.consumerreports.org/fitness-trackers/taking-the-pulse-of-fitbits-contested-heart-rate-monitors/&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Consumer Reports&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-heart-rate-tracking-is-accurate-says-consumer-reports-2210&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Wareable&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; found that Fitbit devices are more or less accurate.

But a lot of people I&#x27;ve talked to seem to like the extra push to walk around and stay active and you can turn them off in the app.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"662\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-04/29/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-27750-1461972300-5.jpg\" width=\"556\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">SmartTrack, which was introduced in November 2015, is available in all of Fitbit&#x27;s newer devices (the Alta, Blaze, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N2BW638/?tag=buzz0f-20&#x22;&#x3E;Charge HR&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N2BWF6Q/?tag=buzz0f-20&#x22;&#x3E;Surge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;).\n\nBefore SmartTrack, you had to first select the exercise on your tracker or the Fitbit app, then press start to get an accurate reading for calorie burn. The tracker can now recognize when you&#x27;re biking, running, doing the elliptical, participating in a high-movement sport (like soccer or tennis), or doing an aerobic workout (like a bootcamp).\n\nI liked that it automatically took my morning bike commute into account!</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Active minutes are available on every Fitbit device, from the $60 Zip to the $250 Surge.\n\nA goal of mine is focusing on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/quick-cardio-workouts?utm_term=.wm5PwQvMW#.riQZxwRk8&#x22;&#x3E;shorter, more intense cardio workouts&#x3C;/a&#x3E; versus longer, slower workouts during which I&#x27;m barely exerting any effort (and mostly wishing I was eating a giant pile of fries) &#x2014; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/total-body-workouts&#x22;&#x3E;a recent study&#x3C;/a&#x3E; proves that quick, arduous exercise can boost fitness just as much as a longer run, if not more.\n\nThis is why I worked really hard every day to up my &#x22;active minutes,&#x22; which Fitbit awards after only 10 minutes of continuous moderate-to-intense activities. I like that Fitbit stresses that intensity is key &#x2014; it&#x27;s a great reminder not to check out during my workout.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"463\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr06/grid-cell-30440-1462990632-22.jpg\" width=\"309\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"463\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr06/grid-cell-30440-1462990635-27.jpg\" width=\"309\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"418\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/3/21/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-6467-1462326705-1.png\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">One thing I like about the Blaze over the Alta is its heart-rate sensing capability. Heart-rate trackers recognize active minutes for activities like weightlifting or yoga, so you&#x27;re still rewarded for doing non-step-based exercise.\n\nAlso, don&#x27;t get any Fitbit trackers if you&#x27;re expecting to use it while swimming!

What I like about the Alta versus other non-heart-rate bands (like Jawbone&#x27;s UP) is that it has a display to see the time.\n\nI was impressed by both of the devices&#x27; battery lives (over a week). The trouble with smartwatches like the Apple Watch is that you have to charge them every night. You only have to charge the Alta (or Blaze) once a week. But ultimately my pick is the Alta because the Blaze is too big and bulky for small wrists. The Alta, on the other hand, is slim and sleek. \n\nI also enjoy the simplicity of it. It&#x27;s so lightweight and the leather band is so soft that I hardly notice I&#x27;m wearing it. Plus, the stainless steel band (pictured here) is glam AF if that&#x27;s what your ensemble calls for. It&#x27;s definitely an upgrade to the Fibit Flex.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"180\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/6/18/enhanced/webdr05/enhanced-26793-1462573983-14.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Steps aren&#x27;t the be-all, end-all solution. Since Fitbit can track sleep and food intake too, you get a more comprehensive look at your health, which can be a good starting point for weight loss. However, you&#x27;ll also need to look closely at &#x3C;i&#x3E;what&#x3C;/i&#x3E; you&#x27;re eating and the &#x3C;i&#x3E;type&#x3C;/i&#x3E; of exercising you&#x27;re doing, which means doing some of your own research. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/the-deal-with-body-fat&#x22;&#x3E;Here&#x27;s an amazing resource&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for everything you need to know about body fat. \n\nIf you&#x27;re already active and want to get even fitter, you&#x27;ll need to work to incorporate more &#x22;active minutes.&#x22; The workouts in the Blaze&#x27;s FitStar apps are pretty basic, so you should supplement them with these &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/quick-running-workouts?utm_term=.qjwomvl1W#.gvJGdPvq3&#x22;&#x3E;quick running workouts&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, or these &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sallytamarkin/intense-crossfit-workouts?utm_term=.upLQGRJDv#.tf26w8MKe&#x22;&#x3E;intense bodyweight exercises&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x2014; and having a tracker won&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;ll reach your goal, but can be a good way to keep track of what kind of exercises you&#x27;re doing. Since many of those exercises aren&#x27;t step-oriented, you&#x27;ll also want something with a heart tracker (like the Blaze), which means that the Alta won&#x27;t cut it. \n\nUltimately, if you&#x27;re looking for a fitness tracker to, you know, track long-term trends, the most important advice we can give you is &#x3C;b&#x3E;get a device you&#x27;ll actually wear&#x3C;/b&#x3E;.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"203\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr10/grid-cell-17886-1462991662-4.jpg\" width=\"203\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Jawbone&#x27;s UP3</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"203\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr10/grid-cell-17886-1462991665-9.jpg\" width=\"203\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Misfit Ray</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"203\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr10/grid-cell-17886-1462991667-14.jpg\" width=\"203\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Garmin Vivofit 3</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Siri&#x2019;s Little Sister Viv Could Be The Virtual Assistant Of Your Dreams</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/siris-creators-want-to-take-on-facebook-be-your-everything-a?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/9/16/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-buzz-24168-1462827119-7.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Noam Galai / Getty Images</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Dag Kittlaus, a 48-year-old engineer from Norway, built the AI personal assistant Siri and sold it to Apple for more than <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/28/apple-siri-200-million/\">$200 million</a>.

Each of Viv&#39;s search results for Kittlaus&#39;s vague searches &mdash; \"find me a great room,\" \"find me a car for six people to Madison Square Garden\" &mdash; were dredged up thanks to \"our friends at Hotels.com\" and \"our friends over at Uber.\" Based on the ease with which Kittlaus could tap a finger and made an effortless, frictionless, expensive purchase, it looked pretty good to be one of Viv&#39;s friends.</p><p>Indeed, Viv is a major computer science innovation whose most immediate value is helping other companies&rsquo; services/apps/money-spending modules pop up precisely when somebody is looking to use them. If it does succeed in taking over your phone (and every other platform in your life), it&rsquo;ll do it not by wrapping itself around your apps, but by taking them over from the inside and becoming the connective tissue between all your meaningful digital interactions. The best way to compete &mdash; and maybe someday win &mdash; in an app-centric, mobile ecosystem is to build your own damn ecosystem on top of everything. \"This is the next major marketplace,\" Kittlaus told the Disrupt audience.</p><p>Kittlaus didn&rsquo;t invent this idea. Last year, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined his own plan <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/facebook-is-eating-the-internet?utm_term=.pm2q9qn5q#.hcw7G71X7\">to try to actually <i>become</i> the internet</a> via the company&#39;s instant messaging app, Messenger. It&#39;s really no wonder Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/05/04/siris-creators-say-theyve-made-something-better-that-will-take-care-of-everything-for-you/\">has reportedly tried to gobble up Viv</a> for his own.</p><p>Viv&#39;s holdout &mdash; it also reportedly turned down an offer from Google &mdash; isn&#39;t without risk.

Despite that it comes from the brains behind Siri, Viv&rsquo;s demo today was clearly meant to position itself as a third-party alternative to big tech, a neutral ecosystem to layer over the mobile ecosystems that have worked for nearly the last decade to reel you in deeper and deeper. <i>We know you&rsquo;re tired of giving up all your personal information and routing and organizing your lives through Facebook and Google and Amazon and Apple, so why not give us a chance to become your digital intermediary?</i> It was a compelling argument to make on a day when arguably the biggest news story in tech revolved around <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006\">human editors at Facebook suppressing news stories</a> based on political bias.</p><p>And Kittlaus &mdash; who helped create Siri only to sell it to Apple for a small fortune and watch its potential turn into...whatever semi-useful experience Siri is today &mdash; is selling Viv as an AI redemption story of sorts. In a recent interview with the <i>Washington Post</i>, he dismissed acquisition talks this time around, suggesting that he wants the technology to be \"ubiquitous\" before once again entertaining the possibility of giving up control and vision.</p><p>Kittlaus and company are great at the vision part. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/viv-labs#/entity\">significant fundraising</a>, acquisition interest, and that Siri pedigree, Viv has managed to generate deep interest and buzz. That&#39;s despite the fact that we&rsquo;re still a very long way away from seeing what its software is really capable of: Kittlaus told the audience before the presentation that he wasn&rsquo;t ready to demo Viv&rsquo;s actual voice yet, and really, there&#39;s no telling if the technology will be anywhere near as seamless in the wild as it was in this very controlled demo. Besides, Kittlaus and co. have left a lot of questions still unanswered: Where is all the one-touch-payment credit card information stored? How will Viv decide which businesses and apps get first priority when I search for a hotel room? How will Viv work to avoid being a gatekeeper and become a truly open developer ecosystem?</p><p>Still, Kittlaus spoke in serious tones about Viv as &ldquo;a new paradigm that comes along and changes the way we interact with computers.&rdquo; As he began the demo, he asked the packed audience if they knew what the company&rsquo;s name meant. One man near the front indulged the rhetorical question. &ldquo;That&#39;s right,&rdquo; Kittlaus said. &ldquo;It means <i>life</i>. We are going to use this to breathe life into the inanimate objects of our lives.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/9/16/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-mid-23571-1462827576-2.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"382\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>A slide shows Viv&#39;s \"dynamic program generation.\"</p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Kittlaus clearly understood the room and how to work it. No matter if the slides detailing Viv&rsquo;s &ldquo;dynamic program generation&rdquo; were indecipherable to non-developers, Kittlaus was here to tell us we were witnessing a &ldquo;computer science breakthrough.&rdquo; I looked around at the rapt audience. People were excited, even if Kittlaus himself never strayed from his monotone delivery, and even if it&rsquo;s just a little bit disenchanting that an exciting &ldquo;computer science breakthrough&rdquo; is essentially just a means of making it so ludicrously easy to buy things that you can drop a grand in 140 seconds.</p><p>But for all its quick-generated weather searches and fancy hotel rooms, Viv&rsquo;s real appeal seemed to come from the idea that a company that&rsquo;s not Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft can try to beat big tech at becoming, as one of my colleagues recently put it, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/nitashatiku/facebook-wants-to-be-the-layer-between-you-and-the-future?utm_term=.vom5V5vg5#.ljVodoY3o\">the layer between you and the future</a>.&rdquo;</p><p>At the end of his presentation, Kittlaus quietly popped up a slide sporting a number of recognizable tech symbols: the four curved lines that signal &#39;Wi-Fi is here,&#39; the maps pin drop, the triangular Bluetooth glyph, and search&#39;s magnifying glass. \"In the next five years, we believe there will be one more new icon that&#39;s universally recognizable,\" he told the crowd. The ubiquitous symbols parted to make way for Viv&#39;s glowing logo.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/9/16/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-mid-23502-1462827277-1.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"256\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Viv</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Charlie Warzel</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/siris-creators-want-to-take-on-facebook-be-your-everything-a</guid>\n<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 17:58:02 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">Viv, a new AI-powered personal assistant, isn&#x27;t quite ready yet, but its first public demo showed a service that makes it so ludicrously easy to buy things that you can drop a grand in 140 seconds.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">charliewarzel</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/10/16/campaign_images/webdr11/siris-creators-want-to-take-on-facebook-be-your-e-2-14488-1462911587-5.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n  <media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/9/16/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-buzz-24168-1462827119-7.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;480&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Noam Galai / Getty Images&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Dag Kittlaus, a 48-year-old engineer from Norway, built the AI personal assistant Siri and sold it to Apple for more than &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/28/apple-siri-200-million/&#x22;&#x3E;$200 million&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.

That&#x26;#39;s despite the fact that we&#x26;rsquo;re still a very long way away from seeing what its software is really capable of: Kittlaus told the audience before the presentation that he wasn&#x26;rsquo;t ready to demo Viv&#x26;rsquo;s actual voice yet, and really, there&#x26;#39;s no telling if the technology will be anywhere near as seamless in the wild as it was in this very controlled demo. Besides, Kittlaus and co. have left a lot of questions still unanswered: Where is all the one-touch-payment credit card information stored? How will Viv decide which businesses and apps get first priority when I search for a hotel room? How will Viv work to avoid being a gatekeeper and become a truly open developer ecosystem?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Still, Kittlaus spoke in serious tones about Viv as &#x26;ldquo;a new paradigm that comes along and changes the way we interact with computers.&#x26;rdquo; As he began the demo, he asked the packed audience if they knew what the company&#x26;rsquo;s name meant. One man near the front indulged the rhetorical question. &#x26;ldquo;That&#x26;#39;s right,&#x26;rdquo; Kittlaus said. &#x26;ldquo;It means &#x3C;i&#x3E;life&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. We are going to use this to breathe life into the inanimate objects of our lives.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/9/16/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-mid-23571-1462827576-2.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;382&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;A slide shows Viv&#x26;#39;s &#x22;dynamic program generation.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Kittlaus clearly understood the room and how to work it. No matter if the slides detailing Viv&#x26;rsquo;s &#x26;ldquo;dynamic program generation&#x26;rdquo; were indecipherable to non-developers, Kittlaus was here to tell us we were witnessing a &#x26;ldquo;computer science breakthrough.&#x26;rdquo; I looked around at the rapt audience. People were excited, even if Kittlaus himself never strayed from his monotone delivery, and even if it&#x26;rsquo;s just a little bit disenchanting that an exciting &#x26;ldquo;computer science breakthrough&#x26;rdquo; is essentially just a means of making it so ludicrously easy to buy things that you can drop a grand in 140 seconds.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But for all its quick-generated weather searches and fancy hotel rooms, Viv&#x26;rsquo;s real appeal seemed to come from the idea that a company that&#x26;rsquo;s not Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft can try to beat big tech at becoming, as one of my colleagues recently put it, &#x26;ldquo;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/nitashatiku/facebook-wants-to-be-the-layer-between-you-and-the-future?utm_term=.vom5V5vg5#.ljVodoY3o&#x22;&#x3E;the layer between you and the future&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;At the end of his presentation, Kittlaus quietly popped up a slide sporting a number of recognizable tech symbols: the four curved lines that signal &#x26;#39;Wi-Fi is here,&#x26;#39; the maps pin drop, the triangular Bluetooth glyph, and search&#x26;#39;s magnifying glass. &#x22;In the next five years, we believe there will be one more new icon that&#x26;#39;s universally recognizable,&#x22; he told the crowd. The ubiquitous symbols parted to make way for Viv&#x26;#39;s glowing logo.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/9/16/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-mid-23502-1462827277-1.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;256&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Viv&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"480\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/9/16/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-buzz-24168-1462827119-7.jpg\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"256\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/9/16/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-mid-23502-1462827277-1.png\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"512\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/9/17/enhanced/webdr14/longform-6895-1462829207-1.jpg\" width=\"300\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">A screenshot of Viv in action.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Google Bans Ads For Payday Loans</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/google-bans-payday-loan-advertising?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/10/enhanced/webdr13/enhanced-buzz-17725-1462978115-8.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"452\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Dan Kitwood / Getty Images</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Google is cutting off its longstanding and lucrative relationship with payday lenders, the search giant said today.</p><p>Starting in July, Google will no longer host \"ads for payday loans and some related products,\" the <a href=\"http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2016/05/an-update-to-our-adwords-policy-on.html\">company&#39;s global public policy director David Graff</a> said in a blog post.

A series of news reports, the first of which revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">Verizon was handing over</a> all of its call data to the National Security Agency, culminated in a contentious Senate debate: key portions of the Patriot Act were reauthorized, granting the government broad surveillance powers, but privacy-minded lawmakers won some hard-fought civil liberties protections.</p><p>The Senate now faces another countdown clock. This time, over the government&rsquo;s authority to eavesdrop on foreigners, a policy viewed as a crucial counterterrorism weapon, but one that may entangle innocent Americans and their Constitutional rights.</p><p>The FISA Amendments Act (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) was last reauthorized in 2012, and allows the government to collect the electronic communications of foreigners located outside the Unites States. As part of that reauthorization, the surveillance law was set to expire at the end of next year.</p><p>Citing privacy concerns and civil liberties violations, critics of FISA point to a provision of the law, known as Section 702, which authorizes the collection of this information through U.S. technology companies. While the government is forbidden from targeting Americans using 702 data collection, the communications of Americans who speak with legally wiretapped foreigners can also be captured.</p><p>The extent of 702 surveillance on Americans, and how this information is used by domestic law enforcement, is still unclear &mdash; even to members of Congress. The apparent lack of transparency fueled most of the disagreement during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, and will propel the coming post-Snowden surveillance debate on Capitol Hill.</p><p>&ldquo;Section 702 is an important tool for our national security agencies,&rdquo; said Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. &ldquo;It is also extremely broad, allowing the government to collect communications without individualized warrants.\" Leahy proposed adding additional safeguards and transparency requirements before FISA is renewed, including asking for an estimate on the number of Americans who&rsquo;ve been caught up in the surveillance of foreign targets.</p><p>Leahy also took issue with so called &ldquo;back-door&rdquo; searches. The searches, according to privacy experts, function as a dubious legal workaround in which U.S. law enforcement surveils a foreign citizen in the hopes of eavesdropping on a particular American with whom the foreigner is associated. &ldquo;These &lsquo;back-door&rsquo; searches raise serious constitutional questions, particularly since the FBI can use them to investigate crimes having nothing to do with national security,&rdquo; Leahy said.</p><p>Elizabeth Goitein, the co-director of the liberty and national security program at New York University Law School, believes section 702 may violate the 4th Amendment, since such end-run searches take place without a particularized warrant. Goitein recommended that an individual court order be required in order for the government to collect communications between a foreign target and an American. She also suggested to lawmakers that they limit FISA&rsquo;s scope by narrowing the definition of foreign intelligence, the categories of people who can be targeted, and ensuring that notice is given anytime evidence derived from 702 surveillance is presented in court.</p><p>Goitein said these changes would help put FISA on better legal ground, and curb some of the data security risks posed by the government amassing a giant database of sensitive information.</p><p>For Silicon Valley, these contested surveillance issues matter not only for tech giants operating as stewards of consumer data, but for American businesses facing scrutiny abroad after the Snowden revelations.</p><p>The majority of the expert witnesses at the hearing however, told lawmakers that FISA should be renewed without changes, describing 702 as a vital deterrent against pervasive threats of terrorism.</p><p>&ldquo;Section 702 is unquestionable a highly effective source of foreign intelligence,&rdquo; said Rachel Brand, a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent agency formed after 9/11 to review the executive branch&rsquo;s policy on counterterrorism.</p><p>Brand said the board does not recommend any legislative changes to FISA, adding that the government already operates under &ldquo;strict rules that minimize its privacy impact.&rdquo; She dismissed the recommendation made by Goitein and her fellow board member, David Medine, that the government first seek a judge&rsquo;s approval before the 702 database can be used to spy on Americans.</p><p>&ldquo;Requiring additional approval for FBI queries would be a step toward re-erecting the information sharing wall that the government has worked so hard to tear down after 9/11,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who also serves on the secretive Intelligence Committee, seemed to share Brand&rsquo;s opinion. She expressed her concerns over looming national security dangers and the need for information sharing. &ldquo;Because I see the intelligence, you get a sense that there is plotting and there is conspiracy going on,&rdquo; Feinstein said. &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t let down our guard. Because to do so is really to invite disaster.&rdquo; She encouraged renewed skepticism and debate on FISA, but dismissed substantive changes to the law.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that the 702 program is really important and it would be most unfortunate if that program were made ineffective,&rdquo; Feinstein said.</p><p>But in what will likely be a key point of contention, as the deadline to FISA&rsquo;s reauthorization draws closer, lawmakers including Sens. Leahy and Al Franken will push to learn about the full extent of the surveillance programs.

This time, over the government&#x26;rsquo;s authority to eavesdrop on foreigners, a policy viewed as a crucial counterterrorism weapon, but one that may entangle innocent Americans and their Constitutional rights.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The FISA Amendments Act (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) was last reauthorized in 2012, and allows the government to collect the electronic communications of foreigners located outside the Unites States. As part of that reauthorization, the surveillance law was set to expire at the end of next year.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Citing privacy concerns and civil liberties violations, critics of FISA point to a provision of the law, known as Section 702, which authorizes the collection of this information through U.S. technology companies. While the government is forbidden from targeting Americans using 702 data collection, the communications of Americans who speak with legally wiretapped foreigners can also be captured.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The extent of 702 surveillance on Americans, and how this information is used by domestic law enforcement, is still unclear &#x26;mdash; even to members of Congress. The apparent lack of transparency fueled most of the disagreement during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, and will propel the coming post-Snowden surveillance debate on Capitol Hill.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Section 702 is an important tool for our national security agencies,&#x26;rdquo; said Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. &#x26;ldquo;It is also extremely broad, allowing the government to collect communications without individualized warrants.&#x22; Leahy proposed adding additional safeguards and transparency requirements before FISA is renewed, including asking for an estimate on the number of Americans who&#x26;rsquo;ve been caught up in the surveillance of foreign targets.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Leahy also took issue with so called &#x26;ldquo;back-door&#x26;rdquo; searches. The searches, according to privacy experts, function as a dubious legal workaround in which U.S. law enforcement surveils a foreign citizen in the hopes of eavesdropping on a particular American with whom the foreigner is associated. &#x26;ldquo;These &#x26;lsquo;back-door&#x26;rsquo; searches raise serious constitutional questions, particularly since the FBI can use them to investigate crimes having nothing to do with national security,&#x26;rdquo; Leahy said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Elizabeth Goitein, the co-director of the liberty and national security program at New York University Law School, believes section 702 may violate the 4th Amendment, since such end-run searches take place without a particularized warrant. Goitein recommended that an individual court order be required in order for the government to collect communications between a foreign target and an American. She also suggested to lawmakers that they limit FISA&#x26;rsquo;s scope by narrowing the definition of foreign intelligence, the categories of people who can be targeted, and ensuring that notice is given anytime evidence derived from 702 surveillance is presented in court.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Goitein said these changes would help put FISA on better legal ground, and curb some of the data security risks posed by the government amassing a giant database of sensitive information.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;For Silicon Valley, these contested surveillance issues matter not only for tech giants operating as stewards of consumer data, but for American businesses facing scrutiny abroad after the Snowden revelations.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The majority of the expert witnesses at the hearing however, told lawmakers that FISA should be renewed without changes, describing 702 as a vital deterrent against pervasive threats of terrorism.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Section 702 is unquestionable a highly effective source of foreign intelligence,&#x26;rdquo; said Rachel Brand, a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent agency formed after 9/11 to review the executive branch&#x26;rsquo;s policy on counterterrorism.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Brand said the board does not recommend any legislative changes to FISA, adding that the government already operates under &#x26;ldquo;strict rules that minimize its privacy impact.&#x26;rdquo; She dismissed the recommendation made by Goitein and her fellow board member, David Medine, that the government first seek a judge&#x26;rsquo;s approval before the 702 database can be used to spy on Americans.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Requiring additional approval for FBI queries would be a step toward re-erecting the information sharing wall that the government has worked so hard to tear down after 9/11,&#x26;rdquo; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who also serves on the secretive Intelligence Committee, seemed to share Brand&#x26;rsquo;s opinion. She expressed her concerns over looming national security dangers and the need for information sharing. &#x26;ldquo;Because I see the intelligence, you get a sense that there is plotting and there is conspiracy going on,&#x26;rdquo; Feinstein said. &#x26;ldquo;We shouldn&#x26;rsquo;t let down our guard. Because to do so is really to invite disaster.&#x26;rdquo; She encouraged renewed skepticism and debate on FISA, but dismissed substantive changes to the law.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I think that the 702 program is really important and it would be most unfortunate if that program were made ineffective,&#x26;rdquo; Feinstein said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But in what will likely be a key point of contention, as the deadline to FISA&#x26;rsquo;s reauthorization draws closer, lawmakers including Sens. Leahy and Al Franken will push to learn about the full extent of the surveillance programs. As with last year&#x26;rsquo;s debate of the Patriot Act, disagreement over the need for increased transparency will likely animate negotiations in Washington as Congress aims to set the right balance between national security and fundamental privacy rights.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Said Franken, &#x26;ldquo;The public can&#x26;rsquo;t know if we succeed in striking that balance if they don&#x26;rsquo;t even have the most basic information about our major surveillance programs.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Mike Judge Helps Us Find The Easter Eggs In &#x22;Silicon Valley&#x27;s&#x22; Opening Credits</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/brendanklinkenberg/mike-judge-helps-us-find-the-easter-eggs-in-silicon-valleys?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>A quick rundown of the blink-and-you-miss-them jokes in the opening credits of the HBO series.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\t\n\n\t \t  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ysAkSornqM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\t  \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=2ysAkSornqM\">youtube.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>On <i>Silicon Valley</i>, HBO&#39;s send-up of the tech industry, the jokes begin long before any actors appear on screen.

The news came as a shock to many in the fast-growing online lending business.</p><p>\"I was really surprised, because Renaud Laplanche has a very good reputation, he was a figurehead of this industry,\" Emmanuel Marot, the founder of LendingRobot, a service that buys up marketplace loans for investors, told BuzzFeed News. Around $50 million of the over $90 million the company manages is invested in Lending Club loans.<br /></p><p>The investigation determined that Lending Club sold $22 million worth of loans to one institutional investor in March and April, despite staff knowing that the loans did not meet the criteria requested by the investor. The wrongdoing included changing the application dates on some of the loans that were being sold.</p><p>Citing a \"violation of the Company&#39;s business practices along with a lack of full disclosure during the review,\" Lending Club&#39;s new executive chairman, Hans Morris, said the board&#39;s response &mdash; including the ouster of the founder and CEO &mdash; was \"swift and decisive.\"</p><p>The investigation also revealed that two Lending Club directors bought personal stakes in a fund that Lending Club later invested in. Bloomberg reported that Lending Club <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-09/mack-invested-with-former-lendingclub-ceo-in-loan-buying-venture\">acquired a 15% stake</a> in Cirrix Capital, a fund in which Laplanche &mdash; who also served as chairman of the Lending Club board &mdash; and board member John Mack both held undisclosed stakes. Cirrix itself was an investor in online marketplace loans, including those from Lending Club.</p><p>Lending Club went public in late 2014, soaring to $23 per share on its first day of trading. The stock fell by 34% to $4.62 on Monday, and is down by 58% so far this year.

The news came as a shock to many in the fast-growing online lending business.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;I was really surprised, because Renaud Laplanche has a very good reputation, he was a figurehead of this industry,&#x22; Emmanuel Marot, the founder of LendingRobot, a service that buys up marketplace loans for investors, told BuzzFeed News. Around $50 million of the over $90 million the company manages is invested in Lending Club loans.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The investigation determined that Lending Club sold $22 million worth of loans to one institutional investor in March and April, despite staff knowing that the loans did not meet the criteria requested by the investor. The wrongdoing included changing the application dates on some of the loans that were being sold.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Citing a &#x22;violation of the Company&#x26;#39;s business practices along with a lack of full disclosure during the review,&#x22; Lending Club&#x26;#39;s new executive chairman, Hans Morris, said the board&#x26;#39;s response &#x26;mdash; including the ouster of the founder and CEO &#x26;mdash; was &#x22;swift and decisive.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The investigation also revealed that two Lending Club directors bought personal stakes in a fund that Lending Club later invested in. Bloomberg reported that Lending Club &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-09/mack-invested-with-former-lendingclub-ceo-in-loan-buying-venture&#x22;&#x3E;acquired a 15% stake&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in Cirrix Capital, a fund in which Laplanche &#x26;mdash; who also served as chairman of the Lending Club board &#x26;mdash; and board member John Mack both held undisclosed stakes. Cirrix itself was an investor in online marketplace loans, including those from Lending Club.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Lending Club went public in late 2014, soaring to $23 per share on its first day of trading. The stock fell by 34% to $4.62 on Monday, and is down by 58% so far this year. The crashing stock is a bad sign for other startup online lenders hoping to go public, and management failures at Lending Club could put a cloud over others in the industry.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Isaac Boltanksy, an analyst at Compass Point, said in a note Monday that the revelations from Lending Club &#x22;will surely spook bank purchasers who have become an increasing part of the company&#x26;rsquo;s funding base, further frustrate the investment community, and ultimately result in stricter scrutiny from both federal and state regulators.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury released a new report, titled &#x22;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Documents/Opportunities_and_Challenges_in_Online_Marketplace_Lending_white_paper.pdf&#x22;&#x3E;Opportunities and Challenges in Online Marketplace Lending&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Matt Burton, the founder of Orchard, which does data analysis for institutional investors, said the fall of an &#x22;industry heavyweight&#x22; like Laplanche came as a shock. &#x22;Integrity is super important in financial services, small mistakes can hurt as much as big mistakes,&#x22; he said.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Bad behavior including &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-federal-and-state-partners-secure-record-13-billion-global-settlement&#x22;&#x3E;misleading investors&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, profiting from &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/advising-deal-goldman-sachs-had-all-angles-for-a-payday/?_r=0&#x22;&#x3E;both sides of a deal&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-59.htm&#x22;&#x3E;undisclosed conflicts of interest&#x3C;/a&#x3E; have become common scandals on Wall Street.

And that they were instructed to block news about Facebook itself in the trending section. </p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for Facebook told BuzzFeed News that they are taking the \"allegations of bias\" seriously, but said rigorous guidelines \"do not permit the suppression of political perspectives.\"</p>\n\n<p>Here is Facebook&#39;s full statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>We take allegations of bias very seriously.

There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. </p>\n\n<p>These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another.

We take these reports extremely seriously, and have found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum. There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another. These guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics.</p>\n\n<p>Trending Topics is designed to showcase the current conversation happening on Facebook. Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.</p>\n\n<p>We are proud that, in 2015, the US election was the most talked-about subject on Facebook, and we want to encourage that robust political discussion from all sides. We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically: reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources. Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we&#39;ve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible. At the same time, our reviewers&#39; actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.</p>\n\n<p>There have been other anonymous allegations -- for instance that we artificially forced &#x202A;#&lrm;BlackLivesMatter&#x202C; to trend.

And that they were instructed to block news about Facebook itself in the trending section. \n\nA spokesperson for Facebook told BuzzFeed News that they are taking the &#x22;allegations of bias&#x22; seriously, but said rigorous guidelines &#x22;do not permit the suppression of political perspectives.&#x22;\n\nHere is Facebook&#x27;s full statement:\n\n&#x3C;blockquote&#x3E;We take allegations of bias very seriously. Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum. Trending Topics shows you the popular topics and hashtags that are being talked about on Facebook. There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. \n\nThese guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another. These guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics.&#x3C;/blockquote&#x3E;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"187\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/10/1/enhanced/webdr05/enhanced-7065-1462857187-7.png\" width=\"277\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">My team is responsible for Trending Topics, and I want to address today&#x27;s reports alleging that Facebook contractors manipulated Trending Topics to suppress stories of interest to conservatives. We take these reports extremely seriously, and have found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true.\n\nFacebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum. There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another. These guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics.\n\nTrending Topics is designed to showcase the current conversation happening on Facebook. Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.\n\nWe are proud that, in 2015, the US election was the most talked-about subject on Facebook, and we want to encourage that robust political discussion from all sides. We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically: reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources. Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we&#x27;ve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible. At the same time, our reviewers&#x27; actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.\n\nThere have been other anonymous allegations -- for instance that we artificially forced &#x202A;#&#x200E;BlackLivesMatter&#x202C; to trend. We looked into that charge and found that it is untrue. We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so. Our guidelines do permit reviewers to take steps to make topics more coherent, such as combining related topics into a single event (such as &#x202A;#&#x200E;starwars&#x202C; and &#x202A;#&#x200E;maythefourthbewithyou&#x202C;), to deliver a more integrated experience.\n\nOur review guidelines for Trending Topics are under constant review, and we will continue to look for improvements. We will also keep looking into any questions about Trending Topics to ensure that people are matched with the stories that are predicted to be the most interesting to them, and to be sure that our methods are as neutral and effective as possible.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Zenefits Co-Founder Sold Stock Months Before Scandal</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/zenefits-co-founder-sold-stock-months-before-scandal?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/8/21/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-624-1462757740-11.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Zenefits co-founder Parker Conrad.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Brian Ach / Getty Images</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Parker Conrad, the Zenefits co-founder who resigned in scandal from the human resources startup, sold stock last year worth $10 million and later negotiated a $130,000 payment as a condition of his resignation, three people with knowledge of the matter told BuzzFeed News.</p><p>Conrad, the longtime CEO and a director of the company, was forced to resign from those positions this February after colleagues learned that he had created and shared with his employees a piece of software to cheat on California insurance broker licensing requirements, according to a report from the law firm Cooley that was obtained by BuzzFeed News.</p><p>The San Francisco-based Zenefits gives away software to help small businesses manage employee benefits, but it makes money by selling those businesses health insurance policies. An inquiry by BuzzFeed News last fall touched off the internal investigation at Zenefits that led to Conrad&#39;s ouster, according to a person familiar with the matter. Conrad was replaced by David Sacks, the former chief operating officer.</p><p>The cheating software Conrad created, known as a macro, was in circulation at Zenefits from 2013, the year he launched the company, into 2015, according to the Cooley report, which was submitted to the Zenefits board in March and released publicly on Monday. The macro allowed Zenefits employees to spend fewer than the legally required 52 hours in online pre-licensing training. Aspiring insurance brokers, including employees who used the macro, had to certify under penalty of perjury that they had spent the full 52 hours in study, the report said.</p><p>In June 2015, before use of the macro was known to other board members or investors, Conrad personally sold Zenefits shares worth $10 million to an outside party, the three people with knowledge of the matter said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The previously unreported sale was done as part of Zenefits&#39; Series C <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/zenefits-is-valued-at-4-billion?utm_term=.jb6vVen7g#.nkMkV5JpO\">funding round</a> announced in May, in which the company raised $500 million and was lauded as a freshly minted \"unicorn,\" valued at $4.5 billion.</p><p>Conrad has retained John W. Keker, a <a href=\"http://www.kvn.com/Lawyers/Keker-John\">prominent trial lawyer</a> in San Francisco, two of the people said. Keker did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Through a spokesperson, Conrad declined to comment.</p><p>After Zenefits investigated the macro in late 2015 and early 2016, Conrad agreed to resign from the company at an emergency board meeting on Feb. 1, according to the Cooley report. But Conrad controlled three of the company&#39;s four board seats, giving him significant leverage in the negotiation over his ouster.</p><p>This allowed him to secure a $130,000 severance payment from Zenefits, the people said. Conrad also kept his Zenefits shares and was permitted to keep unvested stock that would vest over the subsequent six months, according to the people.</p><p>One important right Zenefits retained was the ability to speak openly about the macro and other past failings, the people said.</p><p>Amid the negotiation, Conrad and his advisers drafted a press release that did not make any mention of wrongdoing and instead suggested Conrad was stepping aside voluntarily, said three people who have read that document. But the letter Sacks ultimately published upon <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/zenefits-ceo-parker-conrad-steps-down-after-compliance-failu?utm_term=.tyxM3LOoR#.kwwJAvaBn\">Conrad&rsquo;s resignation</a> made it clear he had left &ldquo;as a result&rdquo; of compliance failures.</p><p>Conrad had enjoyed an unusual degree of control over Zenefits. Until the day he stepped down, he was the human resources administrator, approving vacation requests and offer letters, three people with knowledge of the matter said. Dawn Nott, the company&#39;s human resources director who was hired in 2015, did not have full administrative access for a period of time, two of the people said.</p><p>The Cooley report, based on roughly 15,000 documents and interviews with 16 current and former employees, excoriates Conrad but broadly absolves Sacks, who joined Zenefits in late 2014, of responsibility in the company&rsquo;s past failings. It was released to the public on Monday <a href=\"https://www.zenefits.com/blog/new-zenefits-becoming-compliance-company/\">alongside a blog post by Sacks</a> marking three months as Zenefits&rsquo; CEO. In the post, Sacks said his overhaul of the company&#39;s policies and culture had been so successful that other businesses could now turn to Zenefits for help in complying with government regulations.<br /></p><p>\"If there is a silver lining to the difficulties that Zenefits has gone through the past three months, it is that we have turned compliance into a core part of our values, culture, and expertise,\" Sacks said in the blog post. \"In turn, I believe that we will be able to use this experience to improve our product and help our customers with their own compliance needs.\"</p><p>Conrad, a licensed insurance broker in states across the country, wrote the macro for himself, when he was the only employee of Zenefits, and he wrote a set of instructions for its use, three people with knowledge of the matter said. Public records show that Conrad got his California health insurance license in September 2012, as he was preparing to launch Zenefits. The instructions he wrote, which were emailed around the office along with the macro, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/how-high-flying-zenefits-fell-to-earth?utm_term=.ajVDRw3ml#.tsBZgkxv9\">have been reviewed</a> by BuzzFeed News.</p><p>Other problems finally brought the macro to light. On Nov. 20, 2015, a Friday, as part of an investigation into Zenefits&#39; licensing procedures, BuzzFeed News sent Conrad and a Zenefits spokesperson a list of points that would appear in an upcoming article, asking for their response. This email prompted Zenefits to open an internal review of its licensing compliance.</p><p>On Nov. 24, as part of this review, an employee reported to Joshua Stein, who was then the company&#39;s vice president of litigation, regulatory affairs and public policy, that some employees had used the macro to speed up their licensing process, according to the Cooley report. The employee, who was not identified in the report, blew the whistle on the macro &ldquo;out of a concern for possible legal impact to the company and to improve the company&rsquo;s regulatory compliance,&rdquo; the report said.</p><p>Stein, along with Zenefits general counsel Hillary Smith, shared this revelation on a call with Conrad and Sacks, who was hearing of the macro for the first time, according to the report. Conrad, the report says, \"acknowledged the macro&rsquo;s existence, but did not admit that he wrote it or disseminated it to others at the company.\" One person who was on the call said Conrad was not directly asked about his authorship or dissemination of the macro, but that he reassured the others the software was nothing to worry about.</p><p>The BuzzFeed News article, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/zenefits-under-scrutiny-for-flouting-insurance-laws#.mbE3zDl0M\">published on Nov. 25</a>, reported that Zenefits apparently flouted insurance laws by allowing unlicensed brokers to sell health insurance. It did not mention the macro, which was not known to BuzzFeed News at the time.</p><p>On Jan. 5, after Zenefits&rsquo; own investigation found employees might have lied to California insurance regulators, Stein and Smith met with Conrad and told him they had found &ldquo;violations of California licensing requirements,&rdquo; adding that they intended to hire outside counsel, the report says. This was when, &ldquo;for the first time,&rdquo; Conrad acknowledged he had written the macro, according to the report. Zenefits retained Cooley the next day.</p><p>Sacks learned of the possible criminal implications of the macro -- stemming from the finding that some employees may have lied to regulators about their training under penalty of perjury -- on Jan. 25, in a meeting with Stein, Smith, and two outside lawyers, the report says. That was also when Sacks learned Conrad had created it. Before that meeting, Sacks, who had not sought a license himself, didn&rsquo;t even know about the 52-hour training requirement, according to the report. He \"was dismayed and immediately supported disclosing the macro\" to regulators and Zenefits&#39; investors, the report says.</p><p>Lars Dalgaard, a Zenefits board member and a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, a major Zenefits investor, called an emergency board meeting for Feb. 1, a Monday. (Andreessen Horowitz is also an investor in BuzzFeed.)</p><p>Conrad agreed to resign at that meeting, though the details of his separation agreement would not be finalized until a week later. Immediately after agreeing to resign, three people with knowledge of the matter said, Conrad expressed a desire to start a new company.</p><p>On Saturday, Feb. 6, Sacks directed Zenefits&#39; outside lawyer to report the macro to the California Department of Insurance, the state&#39;s insurance regulator, the Cooley report says. The regulator said later that <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/zenefits-under-investigation-in-california\">it was investigating whether</a> Zenefits complied with laws and regulations in California, the company&#39;s biggest market.</p><p>That Sunday was the Super Bowl, held down the road from San Francisco in Santa Clara, California. Sacks had a ticket to the game and showed up at a pre-game party inside the stadium complex, he has told multiple friends. But his advisers had warned him the macro and its use posed an &ldquo;existential threat&rdquo; to Zenefits. With his phone buzzing with the latest from the talks over Conrad&rsquo;s ouster, Sacks knew he had to leave.</p><p>Arriving home, he realized he still had his Super Bowl ticket hanging around his neck, he has told friends; he ended up handing it to the Uber driver who had given him a ride. Sacks declined to comment on that episode.</p><p>On Tuesday, Feb. 8, Conrad formally agreed to step down as CEO and give up control of the three board seats. Sacks, who took over as CEO that day, has fired managers who promoted use of the macro, expanded the company&#39;s board, and \"clearly communicated to employees the importance of licensing compliance and the wrongfulness of macro use,\" the Cooley report says.</p><p>In his post on Monday, Sacks described new training measures he had put in place, including requiring that every Zenefits broker take 52 hours of coursework and pass a test before October. He also published a chart comparing the company&#39;s \"old values\" with its \"new values.\"</p><p>One of the old values, \"Ready, fire, aim,\" has been replaced with \"Operate with integrity.\" Another, \"Everyone&#39;s shit stinks,\" is now \"Put the customer first.\"</p><p>Conrad, for his part, appears to be seeking a return to the spotlight. A <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/\">Bloomberg Businessweek article</a> on Monday morning, citing an unidentified person close to Conrad, said he &ldquo;regrets resigning and is already working on a new company.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>William Alden</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/zenefits-co-founder-sold-stock-months-before-scandal</guid>\n<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 13:15:45 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">Parker Conrad sold $10 million of stock months before the public learned of compliance failures that led to his resignation.

Conrad, the report says, &#x22;acknowledged the macro&#x26;rsquo;s existence, but did not admit that he wrote it or disseminated it to others at the company.&#x22; One person who was on the call said Conrad was not directly asked about his authorship or dissemination of the macro, but that he reassured the others the software was nothing to worry about.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The BuzzFeed News article, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/zenefits-under-scrutiny-for-flouting-insurance-laws#.mbE3zDl0M&#x22;&#x3E;published on Nov. 25&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, reported that Zenefits apparently flouted insurance laws by allowing unlicensed brokers to sell health insurance. It did not mention the macro, which was not known to BuzzFeed News at the time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On Jan. 5, after Zenefits&#x26;rsquo; own investigation found employees might have lied to California insurance regulators, Stein and Smith met with Conrad and told him they had found &#x26;ldquo;violations of California licensing requirements,&#x26;rdquo; adding that they intended to hire outside counsel, the report says. This was when, &#x26;ldquo;for the first time,&#x26;rdquo; Conrad acknowledged he had written the macro, according to the report. Zenefits retained Cooley the next day.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sacks learned of the possible criminal implications of the macro -- stemming from the finding that some employees may have lied to regulators about their training under penalty of perjury -- on Jan. 25, in a meeting with Stein, Smith, and two outside lawyers, the report says. That was also when Sacks learned Conrad had created it. Before that meeting, Sacks, who had not sought a license himself, didn&#x26;rsquo;t even know about the 52-hour training requirement, according to the report. He &#x22;was dismayed and immediately supported disclosing the macro&#x22; to regulators and Zenefits&#x26;#39; investors, the report says.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Lars Dalgaard, a Zenefits board member and a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, a major Zenefits investor, called an emergency board meeting for Feb. 1, a Monday. (Andreessen Horowitz is also an investor in BuzzFeed.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Conrad agreed to resign at that meeting, though the details of his separation agreement would not be finalized until a week later. Immediately after agreeing to resign, three people with knowledge of the matter said, Conrad expressed a desire to start a new company.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On Saturday, Feb. 6, Sacks directed Zenefits&#x26;#39; outside lawyer to report the macro to the California Department of Insurance, the state&#x26;#39;s insurance regulator, the Cooley report says. The regulator said later that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/zenefits-under-investigation-in-california&#x22;&#x3E;it was investigating whether&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Zenefits complied with laws and regulations in California, the company&#x26;#39;s biggest market.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;That Sunday was the Super Bowl, held down the road from San Francisco in Santa Clara, California. Sacks had a ticket to the game and showed up at a pre-game party inside the stadium complex, he has told multiple friends. But his advisers had warned him the macro and its use posed an &#x26;ldquo;existential threat&#x26;rdquo; to Zenefits. With his phone buzzing with the latest from the talks over Conrad&#x26;rsquo;s ouster, Sacks knew he had to leave.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Arriving home, he realized he still had his Super Bowl ticket hanging around his neck, he has told friends; he ended up handing it to the Uber driver who had given him a ride. Sacks declined to comment on that episode.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On Tuesday, Feb. 8, Conrad formally agreed to step down as CEO and give up control of the three board seats. Sacks, who took over as CEO that day, has fired managers who promoted use of the macro, expanded the company&#x26;#39;s board, and &#x22;clearly communicated to employees the importance of licensing compliance and the wrongfulness of macro use,&#x22; the Cooley report says.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In his post on Monday, Sacks described new training measures he had put in place, including requiring that every Zenefits broker take 52 hours of coursework and pass a test before October. He also published a chart comparing the company&#x26;#39;s &#x22;old values&#x22; with its &#x22;new values.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;One of the old values, &#x22;Ready, fire, aim,&#x22; has been replaced with &#x22;Operate with integrity.&#x22; Another, &#x22;Everyone&#x26;#39;s shit stinks,&#x22; is now &#x22;Put the customer first.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Conrad, for his part, appears to be seeking a return to the spotlight. A &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/&#x22;&#x3E;Bloomberg Businessweek article&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on Monday morning, citing an unidentified person close to Conrad, said he &#x26;ldquo;regrets resigning and is already working on a new company.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>In An Austin Without Uber, Drivers Are Left Wondering What&#x2019;s Next</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/in-an-austin-without-uber-drivers-are-left-wondering-whats-n?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/9/3/enhanced/webdr14/enhanced-mid-4750-1462777534-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/timothykrause/7974460923/\">Flickr: timothykrause</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /></p><p>As Monday morning arrives in Austin, Texas, the thousands of people who&#39;ve come to rely on Uber and Lyft (as both passengers and drivers) in this car-oriented city are waking up to a new reality.</p><p>The two ride-hail leaders <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/salvadorhernandez/lyft-uber-to-halt-operations-in-austin-after-vote?utm_term=.syPkZ1BmkX#.rvq7JnR97P\">lost</a> a major vote on Saturday, one they collectively spent more than $8 million trying to win.
