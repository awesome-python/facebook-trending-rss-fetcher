Pic/YouTube</strong></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Sambhaji Bhosale was born on May 14, 1657. He was the eldest son of Chhatrapati Shivaji and his first wife Saibai. His mother died when he was two and he was raised by his paternal grandmother Jijabai.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> At the age of nine, Sambhaji was sent to live with Raja Jai Singh of Amber, as a political hostage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Despite the tumultous nature of their lives, Shivaji ensured that Sambhaji got the best education befitting a prince. He grew up to be a well read person as also a soldier with commendable martial skills.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Sambhaji was married to Jivubai in a marriage of political alliance, and per Maratha custom she took the name Yesubai. This marriage thus gave Shivaji Maharaj access to the Konkan coastal belt.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Sambhaji's behaviour is a matter of debate. Some of his alleged irresponsibility include 'addiction to sensual pleasures' which led Shivaji to imprison his son at Panhala fort in 1678 to curb his behaviour. However, he escaped from the fort but returned home after a year. Unrepentant of his behaviour, he was again confined to Panhala.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> When Shivaji died, Sambhaji was still held captive in Panhala fort. Shivaji's widow and Sambhaji's stepmother, Soyarabai crowned her 10-year-old son Rajaram as the heir to the Maratha kingdom. When Sambhaji heard about this news, he escaped and took possession of Panhala fort and marched to Raigad fort with 20,000 troops and formally ascended the throne.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Once he became the ruler, he imprisoned his step-brother Rajaram, his wife Janki Bai, and his step-mother Soyaraba. Soyaraba was executed on charges of conspiracy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> It is also said that Prince Akbar (son of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb) who had rebelled against his father sought refuge with Sambhaji, something which was readily accepted. This incensed Aurangzeb to no end and he took it very personally.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Sambhaji's death was a brutal one. Aurangzeb captured Sambhaji and his friend and personal adviser Kavi Kalash and humiliated them by parading them wearing clown's clothes, and they were subjected to insults by the Mughal soldiers. Aurangzeb ordered Sambhaji and Kavi Kalash to be tortured to death. The process which took over a fortnight, included plucking out their eyes and tongue, pulling out their nails, and removing their skin.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Sambhaji was finally killed on March 11,1689 at the age of 31, reportedly by tearing him apart from the front and back with wagh nakhe (metal 'tiger claws') and beheading with an axe at Tulapur on the banks of the Bhima river, near Pune.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Sambhajis disembered remains were later sewn together by some people of Vadu and finally cremated there with ritual obsequies and honours.</p><br/>]]></description></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mumbai: Six live turtles of endangered species rescued in Bandra]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mid-day.com/articles/mumbai-six-live-turtles-of-endangered-species-rescued-in-bandra/17230173]]></link><pubDate><![CDATA[13 May 2016 05:26:51 GMT]]></pubDate><storyid><![CDATA[17230173]]></storyid><media:content type=\"image/jpeg\"/><media:title><![CDATA[Mumbai: Six live turtles of endangered species rescued in Bandra]]></media:title><summary><![CDATA[<p>A team of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau led the drive, acting on a tip-off.

Cooperative Housing Society -- which is facing demolition in keeping with a Bombay High Court order -- be re-allotted to widows of Kargil war heroes who had sacrificed their lives for the nation.<br /><br />Members of \"Bharat Against Corruption\" , led by its president Hemant Patil, today gathered near Adarsh Society tower at Colaba in South Mumbai here to stage a demonstration but withdrew their protest when police told them that section 144 of CrPc -- which prohibits assembly of ten people in an area -- was in force.<br /><br />Patil and other members of the NGO were then taken to Azad Maidan police station and later let off. <br /><br />Senior Police Inspector of Azad Maidan Police Station, Vijay Kadam, said, \"the NGO members withdrew their protest and hence we did not take any action against them.\" Later, speaking to reporters, Patil demanded that the Maharashtra government should file an appeal in the Supreme Court against the Bombay High Court order which had recently asked the Centre to demolish Adarsh Society as it was illegally built upon the plot of land.<br /><br />The land was to be allotted to war widows and hence the allotment to bureaucrats and others was illegal, Patil told PTI.<br /><br />The Bombay HC, on April 29, had ordered demolition of the 31-storey scam-tainted Adarsh tower and sought criminal proceedings against politicians and bureaucrats for \"misuse\" of powers, holding that the building was illegally constructed.<br /><br />However, on a plea made by the Adarsh Housing Society, a division bench stayed its order to pull down the building close to the sea at Colaba for 12 weeks to enable it to file an appeal in the apex court, despite the Maharashtra government opposing it.<br /><br />In its order, the division bench asked the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest to carry out the demolition at the expense of petitioners (Adarsh Society).<br /><br />The court asked the Centre and Maharashtra government to consider initiating civil and criminal proceedings against bureaucrats, ministers and politicians for misuse and abuse of power to get plots under the scheme, originally meant for Kargil war heroes and war widows</p><br/>]]></description></item><item><title><![CDATA[Delhi breathes easy at No. 11 on WHO's most polluted cities

Besides, there are four additional municipal commissioners (AMC) who look after the day-to-day affairs of the civic body. All five IAS officers are allotted bungalows by the civic body. It is a common practice among the bureaucracy, to refurbish their residences as soon as they take charge. However, it appears some of the municipal commissioners have gone way too far.</p>\r\n<p>According to information procured by activist Jeetendra Ghadge under RTI, the BMC has a budget of Rs 50 lakh specifically for the repairs of the MC&rsquo;s bungalow every year. Since 2011, the civic body has spent a total of around Rs 97,31,245 simply on the maintenance and renovation of this bungalow. Ghadge had also asked for details of the bungalows of the AMCs but the information was not furnished.</p>\r\n<p>The highest amount, Rs 39.29 lakh, was spent in 2012, when Subodh Kumar was reigning until May before handing over the charge to Sitaram Kunte. Current MC Ajoy Mehta comes second in spending the amount after taking charge. The expenditure on the bungalow during 2015, when Mehta took charge from Kunte in May, is Rs 29.54 lakh.</p>\r\n<p>According to documents procured under RTI, the civic body spent this amount on internal painting, external painting and general civil repair works in 2015.</p>\r\n<p>The works done in 2015 include removing certain tiles, putting a fibre glass roof sheet, thick acrylic sheets on window panels, apart from painting jobs.</p>\r\n<p>When contacted, Ajoy Mehta declined to speak on the issue.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other cash-rich jobs</strong><br />Ghadge had also demanded the annual maintenance of these bungalows apart from renovation works. According to the reply received under RTI from the executive engineer (maintenance) of the BMC&rsquo;s Metre Workshop, Rs 6.66 lakh has been spent on just the routine maintenance of these bungalows between January 2010 and July 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Whats more, Rs 2.43 lakh were spent in 2013 for the repairs of a toilet block at the Hydraulic Engineer&rsquo;s bungalow occupied by the then additional municipal commissioner in 2013.</p>\r\n<p>According to a query sent to the BMC&rsquo;s mechanical and electrical department, the department has spent Rs 6.39 lakh on the air conditioning of the MC&rsquo;s bungalow as well as those of the AMC (city) and (projects) between January 2010 and July 2015. Of this, Rs 3.82 lakh was spent on the MC&rsquo;s bungalow alone.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is just the tip of the iceberg. There is similar expenditure on the renovation of other bungalows but I did not get access to that information. It is unfortunate that while the ordinary tax-paying Mumbaikar is dying due to potholes on roads, risking life living in dilapidated buildings, and battling erratic water supply, these officials live like royals,&rdquo; Ghadge told mid-day. He has demanded an enquiry into the matter.</p><br/><br/><p><img src=\"http://images.mid-day.com/images/2016/may/Money.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>]]></description></item><item><title><![CDATA[IDOL students upset at MU's musical chairs during exams]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mid-day.com/articles/idol-students-upset-at-mus-musical-chairs-during-exams/17228196]]></link><pubDate><![CDATA[13 May 2016 02:06:20 GMT]]></pubDate><storyid><![CDATA[17228196]]></storyid><media:content type=\"image/jpeg\"/><media:title><![CDATA[IDOL students upset at MU's musical chairs during exams]]></media:title><summary><![CDATA[<p>The examination season is on, and students of the Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), of Mumbai University are stressed not only about studies, but whether they will reach the correct exam centre at the right time, thanks to the ever-changing seating arrangements</p>]]></summary><description><![CDATA[<p>The examination season is on, and students of the Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), of Mumbai University are stressed not only about studies, but whether they will reach the correct exam centre at the right time, thanks to the ever-changing seating arrangements.</p>\r\n<p>Students, who have been appearing for their distance course examinations at the University of Mumbai&rsquo;s Kalina campus, have complained about how the changing seating arrangement for every subject is stressful for them. If a student is appearing at the IDOL centre for one paper, her next paper may be in the Department of Marathi, which is 5-7 minutes away.</p>\r\n<p>There is no transport so they have no choice but to walk. Even if there is a one-hour difference between two papers, it is difficult for candidates to find the different centres because they say there is a lack of appropriate directions.</p>\r\n<p>One of the students, who is appearing for Second Year Bachelor of Arts papers, said, &ldquo;We are not regular students to know the campus properly. Also, we are not informed about the centres in advance. For each paper, we have to search which centre is allotted, by going through the list of seat numbers. Then, the search begins for the allotted centre.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The agitated parent of a student who is appearing for the Third Year Bachelor of Arts papers, said, &ldquo;This is so confusing. There are no clear directions. Thankfully, we have a car so we are able to move about. But for those who are walking, it is very difficult and stressful if they reach a wrong centre. Why can&rsquo;t one student have a single seating arrangement for the entire examination?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Official speak</strong><br />When contacted Ashutosh Rathod, Deputy Registrar, Public Relations for IDOL, said, &ldquo;The seating arrangement is done as per subjects. Hence different papers are at different centres. But we have ensured that there are proper sign boards for students to easily find the places and security officials have been told to help students.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He added, &ldquo;Generally exams are conducted at different colleges. But this time colleges were not available and IDOL had to accommodate all students in the Kalina campus. Considering the examination parameters of having one supervisor for 40 students, and to accommodate all students, we had to have different centres inside campus. But they are not far from each other.&rdquo;</p><br/>]]></description></item><item><title><![CDATA[Now, MARD signs up for a fairer NEET-II]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mid-day.com/articles/now-mard-signs-up-for-a-fairer-neetii/17228188]]></link><pubDate><![CDATA[13 May 2016 01:55:37 GMT]]></pubDate><storyid><![CDATA[17228188]]></storyid><media:content url=\"http://images.mid-day.com/images/2016/may/Teachers-protest-s.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><media:title><![CDATA[Now, MARD signs up for a fairer NEET-II]]></media:title><summary><![CDATA[<p>While the association finds the SC verdict irreversible, it is trying for inclusion of CET curriculum in the national-level exam and regulation of coaching centres</p>]]></summary><description><![CDATA[<p>In the fight against Supreme Court&rsquo;s verdict mandating National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) has also entered the fray. Though the association believes that the verdict is irreversible, it is trying arduously to get medical aspirants some justice.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Parents and teachers protest in Borivali against implementation of NEET this year.

Now, our demands have to be practical and so we are asking for a flexible curriculum. For NEET phase II, CET syllabus can at least be given 75% weightage. It is draconian to expect students to study an entirely new curriculum in just two months. Hence, we have begun this petition online.&rdquo; Simultaneously, MARD has also registered its grievance with the Prime Minister&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n<p><strong>No encashing anxiety</strong><br />While stressed children and parents are flocking to coaching institutes for the crash courses they are offering, MARD has written to the state education department asking them to regulate the centres so that nobody gets fleeced.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have written a letter to the education minister to regulate coaching institutes for the medical entrance examination, at least for this season. As soon as the SC&rsquo;s verdict was out, these institutes began advertising and promoting their crash courses and overcharging parents for it. This exploitation has to stop,&rdquo; said Mundada.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The parent brigade</strong><br />This brigade has been unstoppable since the moment SC pronounced its decision. After holding a silent protest on Wednesday in Vile Parle, the next in the series occurred in Borivali, where again over 200 parents of medical aspirants stood quietly holding placards. Savita Shah, a parent present at the protest yesterday, said, &ldquo;We parents will continue doing all that we can to reinstate CET. Children&rsquo;s preparation of two years can&rsquo;t go to waste like this. The state government has to take a stronger stand.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>They have also started collecting funds for the legal expenses they might incur in case they find a legal way out of this mess.</p>\r\n<p>Priya Shah, a medical aspirant&rsquo;s parent, said, &ldquo;Parents are coming out in large numbers to support our movement. We have to do this for the children who have spent two years preparing for CET and appeared for it too but now it has been canceled.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Another parent Neville Cooper, while talking about their fight, said, &ldquo;This is complete injustice towards children. It is crazy to implement it from this year when even children living in cities are finding it difficult to complete the curriculum despite all the help from tutors. How are they thinking that it is possible for students from rural areas?&rdquo;</p><br/>]]></description></item><item><title><![CDATA[I prayed for better sense to prevail: Trupti Desai on Haji Ali visit]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mid-day.com/articles/i-prayed-for-better-sense-to-prevail-trupti-desai-on-haji-ali-visit/17228184]]></link><pubDate><![CDATA[13 May 2016 01:49:57 GMT]]></pubDate><storyid><![CDATA[17228184]]></storyid><media:content url=\"http://images.mid-day.com/images/2016/may/13-Trupti-Desai-s.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><media:title><![CDATA[I prayed for better sense to prevail: Trupti Desai on Haji Ali visit]]></media:title><summary><![CDATA[<p>Parsis baffled about being embroiled in Haji Ali controversy after AIMIM dares firebrand activist to enter fire temple</p>]]></summary><description><![CDATA[<p>Haji Ali Sabke Liye or Haji Ali for All, a group of activists fighting for equality of men and women&rsquo;s access to the Haji Ali dargah, (women are not allowed in the inner sanctum) had recently removed marquee name, Trupti Desai from their support group. The Haji Ali for All forum stated that Desai&rsquo;s high-octane antics especially the one on April 28, when she went against the forum line saying that she would attempt to enter the dargah, instead of standing outside in a designated spot and creating awareness, were detrimental to their campaign.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Activist Trupti Desai praying at the dargah yesterday.

I prayed at the dargah that the status be reverted to 2011, when ladies could enter the inner sanctum. There is a belief that when people ask for &lsquo;dua&rsquo; here, it is granted. I wish the trustees also get more brains and see the light.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Desai claimed that they have given the trustees a fortnight to reverse the rule disallowing women, &ldquo;if it does not happen then the Bhumata Brigade (her group) will take to the streets,&rdquo; she said reverting to vintage Desai speak.</p>\r\n<p>When told that some activists stated that a Muslim woman should be the &lsquo;face&rsquo; of Haji Ali protests and not Desai, the Pune firebrand said, &ldquo;Muslim women need to step forward.

Hussain&rsquo;s dare is puzzling, as women are allowed in a Parsi temple, non-Parsis (of both genders) are barred.</p>\r\n<p>The Bombay Parsi Panchayat (BPP) was startled to be drawn into the controversy. &ldquo;It is most unexpected,&rdquo; claimed a baffled BPP chairman, Yazdi Desai. The BPP trustees said, collectively, &ldquo;We, Parsis are a miniscule community respected by all our sister communities, who hold us in high regard. We hope and pray that our ancient beliefs and traditions will continue to be respected by all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sajid Supariwala, vice president, of the Mumbai division of the Indian Union Muslim League said of Desai&rsquo;s entry, &ldquo;This is a publicity stunt. If she continues to challenge us and play politics over religion, we will be stop her, like we did on April 28. Last time, she was unable to come out of her car and was publicly ridiculed.

Two days ago, I visited the spot and informed the police, but no action was taken.&rdquo;</p><br/><br/><p><strong>The other side</strong><br />NCP Leader Narendra Verma, who is also the trustee of the school, said, &ldquo;We were the ones who had complained in 2002 when an encroachment had taken place on the land. We are the caretakers of this plot, and it is because of us that encroachment does not happen anymore. The local residents are spreading wrong information saying that we have destroyed the mangroves and trees at the plot. Had there been any mangroves there, we would have not got MHADA&rsquo;s permission to be the caretaker.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are fixing paver blocks on the plot so that the issue of dust is solved. A lot of dust used to come into the school, and during the monsoon, there used to be a problem with all the mud. We are simply beautifying the area and have all the proper permissions,&rdquo; he added. MHADA officials remained unavailable for comment on this issue.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cop speak</strong><br />Senior Police Inspector Kiran Kale from Versova police station said, &ldquo;After the residents complained to us, we visited the spot but did not find any tree was cut.

Gradually gate mitras would be deployed at other places in the northeastern states,\" NFR chief public relations officer Pranav Jyoti Sharma told IANS.</p>\r\n<p>\"To avoid accidents, gate mitras have been deployed at such UMLCs where the road traffic is high and there are apprehensions of mishaps,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>The gate Mitras would be paid Rs.7,000 to Rs.10,000 per month. They would stay at a nearby railway station or a government building and would be provided a schedule as to when they should be at the crossing. The railways would provide them with a uniform, alongwith a high-power light, a flag and a whistle to eanble them warn oncoming road traffic of an approaching train.</p>\r\n<p>Selection of gate mitras would be through outsourcing from manpower providers, the official said.</p>\r\n<p>Sharma said the gate mitras are primarily meant to counsel road users to be vigilant while crossing UMLCs. To this end, they would also distribute safety pamphlets.</p>\r\n<p>\"The idea is to put in place a mechanism before all UMLCs are eventually converted into either manned gates, limited height subways or road over bridges depending on the feasibility,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>The official said that normally caution boards are also erected on both sides of the UMLCs to alert road-users. Speed breakers are also provided on both approaches. Drivers of passing trains are mandated to sound a loud continuous whistle while approaching UMLCs.</p>\r\n<p>\"However it is seen that accidents do occur when road users fail to be alert while crossing the railway track. The gate mitras would counsel people to be alert and to educate them to gauge the speed of the trains so that they do not take unnecessary risks while crossing the railway track,\" Sharma added.</p>\r\n<p>\"This initiative of NFR is expected to go a long way in minimising accidents at UMLCs,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>Mishaps at UMLCs have been claiming many lives over the years. Of the 29,487 level crossings across the country, 19,047 are manned and 10,440 are unmanned.</p><br/>]]></description></item><item><title><![CDATA[SC slaps Rs 10 lakh fine on Spicejet for offloading disabled flyer]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mid-day.com/articles/sc-slaps-rs-10-lakh-fine-on-spicejet-for-offloading-disabled-flyer/17227197]]></link><pubDate><![CDATA[12 May 2016 16:58:36 GMT]]></pubDate><storyid><![CDATA[17227197]]></storyid><media:content url=\"http://images.mid-day.com/images/2014/nov/spicejet-s.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><media:title><![CDATA[SC slaps Rs 10 lakh fine on Spicejet for offloading disabled flyer]]></media:title><summary><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court on Thursday directed&nbsp;budget airline Spicejet to pay Rs 10 Lakh as damages to a&nbsp;flyer, suffering from cerebral palsy, who was forcibly&nbsp;offloaded in 2012, saying the manner in which she was&nbsp;deboarded depicts \"total lack of sensitivity\"</p>]]></summary><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>New Delhi:&nbsp;</strong>The Supreme Court today directed&nbsp;budget airline Spicejet to pay Rs 10 Lakh as damages to a&nbsp;flyer, suffering from cerebral palsy, who was forcibly&nbsp;offloaded in 2012, saying the manner in which she was&nbsp;deboarded depicts \"total lack of sensitivity\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://images.mid-day.com/images/2014/nov/spicejet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"382\" /></p>\r\n<p>The apex court noted that the disabled flier Jeeja Ghosh&nbsp;was not given \"appropriate, fair and caring treatment\" which&nbsp;she required with \"due sensitivity\" and the decision to&nbsp;de-board her was \"uncalled for\".</p>\r\n<p>\"On our finding that SpiceJet acted in a callous manner,&nbsp;and in the process violated Rules, 1937 and Civil Aviation&nbsp;Requirements (CAR), 2008 guidelines resulting in mental and&nbsp;physical suffering experienced by Ghosh and also unreasonable&nbsp;discrimination against her, we award a sum of Rs 10,00,000 as&nbsp;damages to be payable to her,\" a bench comprising Justices A K&nbsp;Sikri and R K Agrawal said.</p>\r\n<p>Ghosh was offloaded from a SpiceJet flight on February 19,&nbsp;2012 from Kolkata when she was going to attend a conference&nbsp;in Goa hosted by NGO ADAPT (Able Disable All People Together),&nbsp;the second petitioner in the case.</p>\r\n<p>The apex court said the decision to offload Ghosh was&nbsp;taken by the airlines without any medical advise or&nbsp;consideration and her condition was not such which required&nbsp;any assistive devices or aids.</p>\r\n<p>\"Even if we assume that there was some blood or froth that&nbsp;was noticed to be oozing out from the sides of her mouth when&nbsp;she was seated in the aircraft (though vehemently denied by&nbsp;her), nobody even cared to interact with her and asked her the&nbsp;reason for the same.</p>\r\n<p>\"No doctor was summoned to examine her condition.

All the benefits which are needed to be given were accorded. The High Court asked us why 'drought-like' and not 'drought (is used in reference to the affected villages). We pointed out that the Manual was adopted more than 25 years back and it provides for the word drought-like. There is no word as drought in the manual,\" Fadnavis told PTI.</p>\r\n<p>\"We also pointed out that even if we call it drought by effecting changes in the manual, it will not attract anything new to be done. What we have done or doing will continue. Court asked us our willingness to change the manual and introduce the word drought. We said we are ready to do that. So we did that and conveyed it to the court,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>State Congress president and former chief minister Ashok Chavan said the government is not serious in tackling the drought and that the decision has been taken keeping in mind the monsoon season which is due shortly. \"The government is simply not serious on tackling drought. They were scared that the courts might take action against them and thus chose to simply adhere to the court and make the necessary changes,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"Also, the government knows that monsoon is soon to arrive and thus they would not have to do anything much even if they bring in the word drought. This is clever tactics played by the government,\" Chavan said.</p>\r\n<p>NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said the government was prompted by the fear that the court would come down on it if it dithered on the issue. \"People are asking this for the last 8 months and the government suddenly wakes up now. They are scared of action<br />by the court and hence they decided to declare drought. This decision, along with CM's meet with the Prime Minister besides seeking additional funds to tackle drought have all been done keeping in mind the monsoon season, which is barely two months away,\" Malik said.</p>\r\n<p>The government on Wednesday issued a corrigendum clarifying that wherever a reference is made to a 'drought-like situation', it would be read as 'drought'.</p>\r\n<p>\"The state government has already taken drought relief measures in villages where the proportion of failed crops is below 50 paise in Kharif and Rabi season. Nevertheless, in future, all instances of villages where the government has mentioned drought-like situation, the reference to the situation will be called as drought,\" stated a government resolution issued in Mumbai on Wednesday.</p>\r\n<p>In the wake of acute water shortage in various parts of Maharashtra, the state government had informed the High Court that it would declare drought in over 29,000 villages in the state and all relief prescribed in the Drought Manual, 2009 would be provided.</p><br/>]]></description></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tests show gazelle killed was chinkara: Prosecution in Salman Khan case]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mid-day.com/articles/tests-show-gazelle-killed-was-chinkara-prosecution-in-salman-khan-case/17227183]]></link><pubDate><![CDATA[12 May 2016 13:36:43 GMT]]></pubDate><storyid><![CDATA[17227183]]></storyid><media:content url=\"http://images.mid-day.com/images/2015/may/sallu-controversies-s.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><media:title><![CDATA[Tests show gazelle killed was chinkara: Prosecution in Salman Khan case]]></media:title><summary><![CDATA[<p>The prosecution told the Rajasthan High Court (HC) in the Salman Khan case that blood samples and hair strands collected by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team from two spots showed that the gazelle killed was an endangered chinkara</p>]]></summary><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jodhpur:</strong> The prosecution on Thursday told the Rajasthan High Court (HC) in the Salman Khan case that blood samples and hair strands collected by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team from two spots showed that the gazelle killed was an endangered chinkara.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Salman Khan\" src=\"http://images.mid-day.com/images/2015/may/salman-airport.jpg\" alt=\"Salman Khan\" width=\"670\" height=\"892\" /><em style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><strong>Salman Khan.

Judge M S Karnik said he was not inclined to give any interim protection to Rane until the next hearing.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, public prosecutor Arfan Sait, while opposing Rane's bail plea, told the HC that the police may not arrest Rane until the court hears the petition on May 17. However, his statement was not taken on record by the court. Rane's lawyer said he wanted to amend the petition because the sessions court, while rejecting Rane's bail plea on May 9, had made certain observations in his favour. The order had said investigations were over and custodial interrogation was no longer required in this case.</p>\r\n<p>A case was earlier registered by Thane police against Rane, his personal assistant Tushar Panchal and bodyguard Manish Singh under IPC for allegedly kidnapping and assaulting Congress president of Chiplun Taluka Sandeep Sawant in April. According to the FIR, Rane and his accomplices had allegedly kidnapped Sawant and assaulted him on way to Mumbai for not attending a rally called by Nilesh Rane at Chiplun in Ratnagiri district to demand reservation for the Maratha community. Sawant was allegedly confined to a house at Andheri in Mumbai and later let-off.</p>\r\n<p>Sawant had told Rane that he could not attend the rally because his mother had taken ill in a nearby village and he had to rush there to be with her.</p>\r\n<p>On the basis of a complaint filed by Sawant, the Thane police registered a case against Rane and his accomplices. Soon after the incident, Sawant was hospitalised and Narayan Rane had visited him to pacify and urge him to withdraw the complaint against Nilesh Rane, but Sawant declared his resolve to fight the case. Rane's lawyer told the court today that the charges levelled against the Congress leader were not very serious and attracted punishment upto seven years, if proved against him.</p>\r\n<p>The allegations that the accused was assaulted with hockey sticks were not true because no injury marks were found on his person when he was hospitalised, Shrirodkar argued.</p><br/>]]></description></item><item><title><![CDATA[Railways provide 6.20 crore litre water to Latur, sends Rs 4 crore bill]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mid-day.com/articles/railways-provide-620-crore-litre-water-to-latur-sends-rs-4-crore-bill/17227168]]></link><pubDate><![CDATA[12 May 2016 10:16:10 GMT]]></pubDate><storyid><![CDATA[17227168]]></storyid><media:content url=\"http://images.mid-day.com/images/2016/apr/11-Latur-Train-s.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><media:title><![CDATA[Railways provide 6.20 crore litre water to Latur, sends Rs 4 crore bill]]></media:title><summary><![CDATA[<p>A month after the first 'water train' reached Latur, the Railways have provided 6.20 crore litre water to the parched region, and sent a Rs four crore bill to the district collector towards transport cost</p>]]></summary><description><![CDATA[<p>A month after the first 'water train' reached Latur, the Railways have provided 6.20 crore litre water to the parched region, and sent a Rs four crore bill to the district collector towards transport cost.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Latur train\" src=\"http://images.mid-day.com/images/2016/apr/11-Latur-Train.jpg\" alt=\"Latur train\" width=\"670\" height=\"446\" /><em style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><strong>Latur train.

And it does not seem to be taking place, because there are remote chances of installing technological advancements into operation on this hilly route,\" a senior CR officer said requesting anonymity. \"There is ample fund but investing on that particular route is not economically viable for the railways because the spot has limited tourist footfall,\" the officer said.</p>\r\n<p>Operation of the 610 MN narrow gauge heritage train has been economically inviable as CR spends about Rs 13 crore annually, while the profit stands only at Rs 3 crore. CR has deployed 222 railway officers and staffers, including 67 break porters, to operate the 26 services in a single day for carrying not more than 1,500 passengers a day.</p>\r\n<p>Recently, the Railway minister had stated that senior most zonal officer and the Divisional Railway Manager would be held responsible if any mishap occur under their jurisdiction.
