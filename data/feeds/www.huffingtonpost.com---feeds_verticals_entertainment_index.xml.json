That is certainly not the case with \"Being Charlie\". Here we have a story about super upscale people who live in clean surroundings and for whom money is not a problem. The main character is an eighteen year old named Charlie, a character based on Nick Reiner who is the son of actor/director Rob Reiner. Nick co-wrote the script and his father directed the film.<br />\n<br />\nAt the start of the film Charlie (Nick Robinson) walks out of a rehab facility. When he gets to his parents house he is told by his father David (Cary Elwes) that he is either going to an adult rehab facility or to jail on an outstanding warrant. He opts to try the adult facility, knowing that his heart and his mind are not into being cured.<br />\n<br />\nCharlie is at odds with his parents. He feels pushed aside by his father's political ambitions and isolated from his mother because of his father's controlling ways. He also comes off as spoiled and egocentric. His best friend Adam (Devon Bostwick) tries to be there for him at every turn, but Charlie is always asking more than he gives.<br />\n<br />\nIn the script Nick Reiner co-wrote with Matt Elisofon both Charlie and his father are not shown to be admirable people. Elwes' David is pre-occupied with his political career and also convinced \"tough love\" is the solution to Charlie's problems. On the other hand Charlie never tries to break through to his parents but remains aloof and non-communicative.<br />\n<br />\nStill the movie is engrossing and entertaining mainly because of Robinson's performance. He provides his character with a core of likeability that shines through even when Charlie is being his most obnoxious. He has a wholesome look to him and actually looks like an eighteen year old rather than a twenty-five year old trying to look eighteen, which is what we usually get.<br />\n<br />\nThe film is rated R for profanity, nudity and violence.<br />\n<br />\n\"Being Charlie\" is not a great movie but it is a good one. It lacks the depth a movie about this subject should have, but it compensates by being honest in its approach. \"Being Charlie\" is a tale of drug use among the upper class. Charlie's family can certainly afford the pricey rehab facilities which Charlie scorns one after the other, but in the real world money can not solve some of life's toughest problems. <br />\n<br />\nNick Reiner lays it all out there for the world to see in his screenplay, while Rob Reiner brings the story to life on the screen warts and all<br />\n<br />\nI scored \"Being Charlie\" an existing 6 out of 10.<br />\n<br />\nJackie K Cooper<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.jackiekcooper.com\" target=\"_hplink\">www.jackiekcooper.com</a> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/SPOTTOON/spottoon-peak-s3ep8_b_9942848.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[PEAK - S3Ep.8]]></title>\n      <author>Spottoon</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/SPOTTOON/spottoon-peak-s3ep8_b_9942848.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment&amp;ir=Entertainment</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:56:28 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<script type=\"text/javascript\"><br />\nfunction spottoonResize(){<br />\n   jQuery.ajax({<br />\n      type : \"POST\",<br />\n      async : false,<br />\n      url : \"https://www.spottoon.com/huff/height\",<br />\n      dataType : \"json\",<br />\n      data : {book_no : jQuery(\"#book_no\").val(),ch_no : jQuery(\"#ch_no\").val()},<br />\n      success :<br />\n         function(data, statusText, xhr){jQuery(\"#ifSpot\").prop(\"src\",\"https://www.spottoon.com/huff/view?book_no=\" + jQuery(\"#book_no\").val() + \"&ch_no=\" + jQuery(\"#ch_no\").val());<br />\n             jQuery(\"#ifSpot\").prop(\"height\",data[\"height\"]);<br />\n        }<br />\n   });<br />\n}<br />\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", spottoonResize);<br />\n</script><br />\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"book_no\" name=\"book_no\" value=\"13\"/><br />\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"ch_no\" name=\"ch_no\" value=\"763\"/><br />\n<iframe id=\"ifSpot\"  width=\"100%\"  scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" no-mw-resize></iframe><br />\n<font size=5><strong><em><center>Updated every Friday</center></em></strong></font></br><br />\n<font size=2><em><center>Copyright \u24d2 2015 RollingStory Inc.</center></em></font></br> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4314474/images/s-PEAKS2EP8-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/the-big-bang-theory-finale-cliffhanger_n_9942164.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA['The Big Bang Theory' Finale Left Us With A Crazy Cliffhanger]]></title>\n      <author>Bill Bradley</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/the-big-bang-theory-finale-cliffhanger_n_9942164.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment&amp;ir=Entertainment</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:17:39 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<br />\n<p>Season 9 of \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/big-bang-theory/\">The Big Bang Theory</a>\" has had some of the show's most anticipated moments: Leonard and Penny tied the knot, Bernadette revealed that she's pregnant and then&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheldon-and-amy-sex-big-bang-theory_us_564c7d2de4b08cda348b81ab\">Sheldon and Amy </a>finally did, you know, \"it.\"</p><br />\n<p>Then, on Thursday's finale, it all ended with a bang.</p><br />\n<p>At long last, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/big-bang-theory-leonard-father-cast_us_56eaa378e4b0b25c918481c6\">Leonard's father</a>, Dr. Alfred Hofstadter&nbsp;(Judd Hirsch), has come to the show, making an appearance in honor of Leonard and Penny's upcoming second wedding.

It took like, what, 10 years for me to get to this point.\"</p><br />\n<p>Even with her impressive resume, Jackson faces constant shallow criticism about things like her appearance.&nbsp;In a Q&amp;A with HuffPost, the actress talked about her career, her style, speaking out against online bullying and being perpetually unbothered by the haters. Prepare yourself to add a new hero to your list.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>The Huffington Post: </strong><strong>What's the most exciting thing about the work you do?</strong></p><br />\n<p>Jackson: Just doing something that I love to do. Even when I go to work now, it doesn't feel like a job for me. It's fun. Getting to see everyone everyday on set -- the creators, the different crew members, the cast members. And then just having people who support me. I never thought in a million years so many people would support me and watch my TV shows, which is pretty amazing because without them, I would not be here at all.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><strong>What are some challenges you face as a child actress?</strong></p><br />\n<p>For me, it's a little bit harder for me to make friends outside [of the industry] because I don't go to a regular school and I am homeschooled. I do have friends, which is great. But also [experiencing]&nbsp;the fun little school and special occasions like prom and things like that. I'm pretty sure I will find a way to experience it, but it is a little bit harder for me.</p><br />\n<p><strong>Do you ever feel any pressure to mature faster or slower with your career?</strong></p><br />\n<p>I think being a kid is a wonderful thing, and I don't want to speed up that process any more. Eventually that time will come sooner or later when you're like 21 years old, 22, and it's gonna come faster than you think. So no, I don't really wish that I was older or have the pressure from certain people. I just like who I am and how I like to look. And it's not for me a maturity thing. I honestly don't think I dress much older than I [am]. You have to think about it. Kids who are 14 who don't really go on red carpets... they don't dress like that because they don't have things like that to do and I do.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><strong>Which other teens in the industry do you look up to or admire?</strong></p><br />\n<p>I would definitely say Amandla Stenberg. And I say her because she is such a good role model for kids and even adults, too. So many adults love her. And she stands [up against] cultural appropriation and things like that that need to be spoken about... That is amazing, especially someone that young -- only like 17 years old -- is taking the time and doing these things. I definitely look up to her and I think that what she's doing is great because I think at this point in time in our lives that these are things that need to be talked about and need to be heard.</p><br />\n<p><strong>What was your initial reaction when you saw yourself as a meme?</strong></p><br />\n<p>When I first saw the meme, I honestly didn't understand why people were making memes of me. I was like 'What's so funny about this? There's so many memes going on.' Then I was going through them and they're actually really funny. I don't know who created these but they actually did a pretty good job because it makes me laugh and I took no offense to it and that's why I posted it on my Instagram and Twitter. It's just really funny, and I have a good sense of humor. So I just thought, 'oh wow, that's cool now that I'm a meme and I'm on like all social media pages, on Twitter 24/7.' And even people approach me, like different actresses and actors, they come up to me like&nbsp;'I see you on my Instagram page like 24/7.'&nbsp;</p><br />\n<div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\"><br />\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BEH0UKOR51P/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">I&#39;m dead   #skaisthelimit</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Skai \u265b (@skaijackson) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-04-13T01:33:38+00:00\">Apr 12, 2016 at 6:33pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><br />\n<script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script></div></div><br />\n     <br />\n<p><strong>There are a lot of young actresses like Amandla and Zendaya who have had to stand up for themselves when they've come under internet bullying. You've experienced that yourself. How do you keep such thick skin, especially when dealing with these hateful comments online?</strong></p><br />\n<p>I definitely deal with that all the time, but I just think of it like this: No one's gonna like [everything] you do at the end of the day. There's always gonna be someone who doesn't like what you do who's gonna always hate on you. But for me, I'm living for what I do, I'm living for myself. And I just worry about myself and I don't... anyone's opinion that's hateful, it just doesn't matter to me because to me, it feels like for you to be spending time to comment on my page or liking my posts and saying these things, obviously I'm doing something for you to pay attention. So no matter what I'm doing, you guys are paying attention even though you are hating. So I just don't take any offense to it and I've dealt with it since I was 9 years old and even younger. And know that it doesn't really matter what people say. I'm just rooting for myself.</p><br />\n<p><strong>After you stood up to Azealia Banks on Twitter, your mom had a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFQE-Laq0O8/?taken-by=kiyacole\" target=\"_blank\">response of her own</a>. How has your mom influenced your confidence and how did that give you the courage to stand up to being bullied?</strong></p><br />\n<p>My mom has definitely influenced my confidence, because when I was younger in public school, I would always get bullied for little things like being the shortest in my class, being smallest, just really stupid things. And my mom would always tell me, \"if someone bullies you, don't just sit there and let them bully you. Do something about it or tell someone about it.\" So I have always taken that on, what my mother said. And I kinda used that with the whole Azealia thing that just happened. I mean, she is a bully, she is an internet troll. So for me, reading all these racial slurs that she was saying to different celebrities in the past couple months -- and I'm like the 30th person now -- I felt that I just had to voice my opinion because I have dealt with bullies over the internet and in person. I just feel like what she's doing is not OK.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><br />\n<span class=\"quote\">I felt that I just had to voice my opinion because I have dealt with bullies over the internet and in person. I just feel like what she's doing is not OK.</span><br />\n<br />\n</blockquote><br />\n     <br />\n<p><strong>What advice do you have to teens and young people who struggle with bullying, especially online?</strong></p><br />\n<p>Try not to worry about it as much because, like I said, no one's gonna like everything you do... just stay confident and know that what they are saying is not true. That's their opinion, they can talk all about you, but at the end of the day, you're a beautiful person and you don't need to meet anyone else's standards. Just live for you.</p><br />\n<p><strong>What are your future goals?</strong></p><br />\n<p>I would definitely say doing more serious and dramatic films and even scary films. Scary movies are one of my favorite movies to watch and I've loved scary movies since I was like three years old... And I definitely want to do other things outside of acting. Maybe like producing, directing, things like that are still kind of in the acting field. And then, eventually, other than acting, I do wanna get my hands in fashion. That's something I've always wanted to do. I've always wanted to design clothes. So hopefully, sooner than later, I will get to design clothes for you guys.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><strong>What's one thing you want younger people to always remember?&nbsp;</strong></p><br />\n<p>Whatever you want to do in life -- you wanna be a cheerleader, you wanna be an actress, you wanna be an actor -- whatever you want to do in life, just know that you will do it. Just believe in yourself. And it might take so many years to finally accomplish that, but you have to work for it. You have to work hard for it. And that's what I do, too. I worked hard for the place that I wanted to be. I said when I was four years old where I wanted to be in 10 years. Never give up and just stay confident.&nbsp;</p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/5735026222000042072567b4.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/nashville-canceled-after-four-seasons_n_9939578.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[ABC Plays 'The Wrong Song,' Cancels 'Nashville' After 4 Seasons]]></title>\n      <author>Carly Ledbetter</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/nashville-canceled-after-four-seasons_n_9939578.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment&amp;ir=Entertainment</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:14:37 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<br />\n<p>After four seasons on \"ABC,\" fan-favorite series \"Nashville\" has been canceled, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/nashville-cancelled-abc-season-5-1201773217/\" target=\"_blank\">according to Variety</a>.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Deadline reports that the country music series, starring Hayden Panettiere and Connie Britton, would've <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/05/nashville-canceled-abc-4-seasons-1201754363/\" target=\"_blank\">had new showrunners</a>&nbsp;had it made it to a fifth season, and that they were reportedly working with writers on stories for the next season.

According to Will.i.am,&nbsp;\"Prince steps off the stage and plays the bass in Michael's face.\"</p><br />\n<p>Witnessing Prince's unparalleled guitar skills in person would be a welcome once-in-a-lifetime experience for most, but Jackson took offense to singer's aggressive guitar-playing.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>The next morning Will.i.am met Michael for breakfast, \"and the first words he says as he opens the door are, 'Why was Prince playing the bass in my face?'\" Will.i.am said. \"When I said he was just being nice, Michael said, 'No, he's always been a meanie.'\"</p><br />\n<p>Decades earlier, however, the two<a href=\"http://www.vibe.com/2016/04/prince-michael-jackson-james-brown-shared-the-stage/\" target=\"_blank\"> shared the stage with the great James Brown</a> at Hollywood&rsquo;s Beverly Theater in 1983.

I suppose you can credit that to the great David Bowie and other musicians from that era. You see, Tor lives and breathes the music of that time and he is taking that sound and incorporated it into his music. I met Tor, and if it sounds like Thor then you can call him the \"Gladiator of Music\", because he has an incredible voice and when you pair with music you get this amazing combination that he calls Indie Pop. <br />\n<br />\nI will admit that I didn't know much about Tor Miller or his music before getting an invitation to hear him play live on a rooftop in the Flatiron district of Manhattan, New York. The setting was the offices of GREY Global Group, an advertising and marketing firm that has a music division. I was intrigued by a rooftop concert on what was a glorious and yes gorgeous day in New York City. It was a pleasant surprise after nearly a week of non-stop rain. I met Tor inside of a greenroom where the young singer was surrounded by PR people making sure that he hit all the right spots during our ten minute exchange. <br />\n<br />\nKM: Tor, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me. I understand you are preforming on the rooftop today, what are we in store for? <br />\n<br />\nTor: \"I have two guys from my band with me today and we will do sort of a strip back set of what we do when we are on tour and it will be emotional, it will be hopefully pleasant for you guys.\" <br />\n<br />\nKM: You will also be preforming your new single \"Baby Blue\" why is this song so significant? <br />\n<br />\nTor: \"That song, I have very excited to have it out now. You know it's been a long time coming and it's a song that means a lot to me. I was dating this girl and she came to New York from California and sort of had a very sheltered upbringing and you know was living on her own for the first time and got to see the world without her parents living over her head. I watched from the sidelines of everything she had to go through and I wrote this song to try and make her feel better.\" <br />\n<br />\nKM: \"American English\" is the debut album coming out this fall; give some details on what we can expect? <br />\n<br />\nTor: \"Well there will be about twelve or thirteen tracks and it was written over a period of three or four years so for me I can't wait from it to come out and I'm very excited about and it's these very lush  arrangements and we had the time to make and craft the record I had in my head. So I'm very excited to get it out there.\" <br />\n<br />\nKM: For people who may not know you, young music, or your sound, explain yourself in a couple of words? <br />\n<br />\nTor: \"My music is very piano based because that's my instrument and it is deeply personal of relationship songs which transcends more than just girlfriend or boyfriend but relationships that you have with family and friends and sort of coming to terms with your existence almost and how you feel about the world. I'm very inspired by Bowie, the 70s, and Elton John. This record that is coming out is my attempt to make the kind of music that I love to listen to.\" <br />\n<br />\nTor is taking his sound to the masses with his debut album \"American English\" and along the way has he grows as an artist he has a list of the top three people he would love to collaborate with in the studio. He's hoping Justin Vernon (Bon Iver), Kevin Parker (Tame Impala), and Frank Ocean or Miguel answers the call to record a song with him. I can say now that after listening to Tor Miller on the rooftop on that nice New York City day he definitely has the voice to draw in the crowds, dare I say it Tor, the Gladiator of Music, has that \"it factor\" that will take him all the way. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/816272/images/s-MUSIC-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
