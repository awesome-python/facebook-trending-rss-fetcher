Luthier Andy Beech of <a href=\"http://www.dhaitreguitars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">D&#8217;haitre Guitars</a> in Bellingham, Washington is behind many of them. Beech designed 31 instruments for the late musicians including his famous\u00a0&#8220;Cloud&#8221; guitar and &#8220;Symbol&#8221; guitar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel unbelievably privileged,&#8221; Beech said\u00a0while showing how the specialized instrument was constructed. &#8220;When I did this many years ago, when I started doing this, he only took somebody&#8217;s word that I was capable of doing.&#8221;\u00a0Prince was involved with the process of crafting the guitars, said Beech.</p>\n<div id=\"ym_Article\">\u00a0The particular structure of Beech&#8217;s\u00a0guitars made them\u00a0as much tools\u00a0as they were\u00a0showpieces. He most famously utilized its shape at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2007, which left Beech &#8220;breathless&#8221; and\u00a0&#8220;screaming at the TV.&#8221;</div>\n<p>As integral as Beech was to Prince&#8217;s music, the luthier never met\u00a0the Purple One. &#8220;I had the opportunity several times to go down there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had good friends working for him.

Bhatnagar, along with fellow Undying Inc. drummer Nishant Hagjer, joined in late 2015. Vohra, who founded the band as the lead vocalist, says, \u201cMost of the songs in this EP are written and composed by me, as these songs were recorded earlier with the previous lineup. We had to change all the parts except the guitars.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Listen to </em>Soul Inclination EP<em> here</em><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/224355337%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-k9lRg&amp;auto_play=true&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The band recorded with ace producer <a href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/turn-it-up-to-11-keshav-dhar-of-skyharbor/\" target=\"_blank\">Keshav Dhar</a> [from prog band <a href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/listen-skyharbors-new-single-out-of-time/\" target=\"_blank\">Skyharbor</a>] at Illusion Audio, with drums being recorded by Hagjer at Lucid Recess Studio in Guwahati and Delhi\u2019s Studio Fuzz. Hagjer says about joining the band, \u201cIt started out with my interest to try another genre out and having another reason to play more drums. Little did I know that the band chemistry would work really well.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65705\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-65705\" src=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cover-art-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Cover-art\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Soul Inclination EP artwork by Gaurav Basu aka Acid Toad</p></div>\n<p>There\u2019s an immediate connection listeners can make from the opening song \u201cWho\u2019s Your God?\u201d to the likes of Soundgarden, Bhatnagar sounding every bit like Chris Cornell, although he does bring out the growl on the heavy-as-ever \u201cReturn To Self,\u201d for which they will release a music video. Bhatnagar mentions that the subject matter of the song is just as dark as the slow-burn guitars. \u201cThe song is loosely based on a few small parts of my life, when I was going through certain suicidal tendencies. I was younger, of course. It\u2019s a song I wanted to hear back in those times. It&#8217;s about my mental war, with my will to kill myself.\u201d Bassist Sharma adds, \u201cThe way I see it, it&#8217;s about how you&#8217;ve got to live for yourself. Yes, life at times can be hard. We all face the harshness, but resorting to any extreme measure that could possibly be hurting you or your loved ones is not worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The band takes a turn down a more melancholic path on the acoustic-led \u201cRunning Today\u201d and the eerie instrumental closer \u201cBorn of a Sun.\u201d Grunge is still relevant to the band, who have now polished it up and offered its energy and aggression in a new package. Says Vohra, &#8220;The best part is how amazingly they [grunge bands] have shared their personal stories and social issues with their songs which can just stay in your mind and heart forever. I could just feel an instant connect with their music. So why not to open ourselves and share what we feel in whatever way we want to?&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Watch a teaser for the &#8220;Return to Self&#8221; video</em><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/unA0Yz1B34c?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/exclusive-stream-delhi-grunge-rockers-soul-inclination-debut-ep/\">Exclusive Stream: Delhi Grunge Rockers Soul Inclination\u2019s Debut EP</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com\">Rolling Stone India</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://rollingstoneindia.com/exclusive-stream-delhi-grunge-rockers-soul-inclination-debut-ep/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>New Music: From Mumbai Hardcore to Chennai Pop</title>\n\t\t<link>http://rollingstoneindia.com/new-music-from-mumbai-hardcore-to-chennai-pop/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://rollingstoneindia.com/new-music-from-mumbai-hardcore-to-chennai-pop/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:07:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Anurag Tagat]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[New Music]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News & Updates]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[A Scarlet Dress]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Black Letters]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Cosmic attic]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Death By Fungi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Harsha Iyer]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NaeZy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Oneironaut]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[short round]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Spud In The Box]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Colour Compound]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://rollingstoneindia.com/?p=65698</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>This month, we round up the latest releases from metalcore act A Scarlet Dress to rapper Naezy\u2019s latest politically-charged single </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/new-music-from-mumbai-hardcore-to-chennai-pop/\">New Music: From Mumbai Hardcore to Chennai Pop</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com\">Rolling Stone India</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Climb </em>by Cosmic Attic</strong><br />\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 350px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3552031127/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/minimal=true/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://cosmicattic.bandcamp.com/album/climb-ep\">Climb EP by Cosmic Attic</a></iframe><br />\nAfter moving from Bengaluru to Mumbai earlier this year, vocalist-guitarist Sharath Narayan tries\u00a0his hand at electronic music with his new project Cosmic Attic.

It\u2019s certainly a much more concentrated approach towards songwriting and production compared to their self-titled 2015 debut, with songs in the vein of hardcore/mathcore bands such as Converge and the Dillinger Escape Plan that get even more interesting as they call out metal musicians [\u201cIced\u201d] and the existential dread of being a band in India [\u201cEndless Rain.\u201d]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cHow Much Longer\u201d by Harsha Iyer </strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSXWp-_hhx8?rel=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br />\nChennai-based pop artist Harsha Iyer ponders the big questions about life and loneliness through on his latest single \u201cHow Much Longer\u201d.

In the year that Leonardo DiCaprio, Hollywood\u2019s golden boy, <a href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/oscars-2016-the-complete-winners-list/\">won his much deserved and long overdue golden statuette</a>, in a sign of other things notably overdue, Spike Lee was absent despite his honorary Oscar win in 2015. The director was one amongst several boycotts due to the all-White ballot or as he put it, \u201c40 White Actors In 2 Years And No Flava At All\u201d.\u00a0Simmering fury has given way to diversity initiatives, an Oscar\u00a0Committee shake up and a push towards the fantasy that is colour blind casting. But where are all the brown people?</p>\n<p>Priyanka Chopra cut an elegant figure on the Oscar stage and I applaud her for busting down network doors <em>Quantico</em> style so\u00a0others can follow. Still the diversity debate is a checker board, one\u00a0with very little discussion outside black or white. The black creative community has waged a long war to being heard. So David Oyelowo,\u00a0ironically overlooked by the Oscar Committee for his incredible turn as Martin Luther King in <em>Selma</em>, is now in high demand and the<em> Ghostbusters</em> reboot welcomes Leslie Jones as a black female poltergeist annihilator. But while rumors that Idris Elba might be the first black James Bond gather fans, a similar switching of the color palette from white to brown remains a pipe dream.</p>\n<p>If no one is banging the dhol to make sure that Indians are well\u00a0represented on screen, we won\u2019t move the needle much from Peter Sellers donning brownface in <em>The Party</em>. Tropes that confine us continue to exist. We\u2019ve progressed from Apu in <em>The Simpsons</em>\u00a0only by IQ points. Kunal Nayyar\u2019s role in <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> as\u00a0a Caltech astrophysicist and Dev Patel\u2019s role as mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan in<em> The Man Who Knew Infinity</em>, perpetuate stereotypes, albeit smarter ones. Aziz Ansari has broken a boundary in his show <em>Master of None</em> by addressing issues that face Indian actors. But how much is the collective psyche really changing if he and Mindy Kaling have had to write their own parts and create their own shows in a system that hesitates to cast an Indian as actor first, ethnic minority second. Pee Cee has challenged that\u00a0very paradigm, making it clear that whether playing FBI agent or <em>Baywatch</em> villainess she will not prop up Indian clich\u00e9s. And as Deepika Padukone follows suit, playing the lead in Vin Diesel\u2019s next outing, the Bollywood-Hollywood tryst is escalating. However, like Irrfan Khan and Anil Kapoor before them, the current Bollywood crop flirt with the US and settle down at home. And for its part, Hollywood is tapping into the star power of Bollywood, not trying to replace the all supreme White Leading Man.</p>\n<p>An endemic problem solution needs an endemic solution. When\u00a0there are more Indian actors clamoring for roles in America, a\u00a0bigger uproar that of close to three million Indians in the US less\u00a0than a hundred have recognition on screen and enough actual\u00a0power to stage a boycott, things might shift. Just last year famed black actor Chiwetel Ejiofor was cast as Indian rocket scientist\u00a0Vincent Kapoor in <em>The Martian</em> and the fall out was a mere\u00a0whimper.

In an interview with BBC Radio 1Xtra, the singer detailed how follow-up material to 2013&#8217;s\u00a0<em>The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2</em> sprung from the project and he also hinted at a future collaboration with The Weeknd.</p>\n<p>Prior to Timberlake releasing &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5RobDomh5U\">Can&#8217;t Stop the Feeling!</a>,&#8221; his first song in three years, Timberlake shared an Instagram photo in the studio with Pharrell Williams, which led to speculation about him working on a new solo album. In the BBC interview, the singer clarified that his meeting with Williams happened after his work on the<em>Trolls </em>song. &#8220;I started working on the music for this movie prior to that [photo being taken],&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But then working on the music for this movie just got me really excited about being back in the studio again &#8217;cause I kind of took some time off, you know, having a new family member, having a son. I just kind of took some time off and wanted to just be in that experience.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"ym_Article\">\u00a0Timberlake and his wife, actress Jessica Biel, welcomed their son, Silas, last year.</div>\n<p>&#8220;And then this [<em>Trolls</em>] project came along and that was a little bit of serendipity as well, you know, to be offered an animated film,&#8221; he said. Timberlake serves as the executive music producer and also a lead voice for character Branch in the film. &#8220;It felt like a job that fell into your lap,&#8221; he added. He also revealed that both Ariana Grande and Gwen Stefani will appear on the soundtrack, which he said was not completed yet. &#8220;Gwen does one that I think I&#8217;m actually gonna feature on with her as a duet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Timberlake said that the work on the film sparked some inspiration. &#8220;So then as that was happening I just wanted to stay in the studio, wanted to keep going in the studio &#8217;cause you just get the creativity going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This led to his recent studio time with Williams and also Timbaland. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly what it&#8217;s going to be yet &#8217;cause we just really started,&#8221; he said. He explained that the timeframe of a movie release requires that it&#8217;s finished by a certain point, whereas with his solo work he doesn&#8217;t have the same pressure. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s one of those things that&#8217;s just a feeling like you know it&#8217;s done when it&#8217;s done,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The singer also hinted that a Weeknd collaboration may soon be in the works. &#8220;The Weeknd and I have been talking about doing a collaboration soon. He&#8217;s working on an album. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m supposed to say that,&#8221; Timberlake said. &#8220;He&#8217;s always in the studio anyway. But we&#8217;ve talked about doing something together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Timberlake recently appeared with his <em>Trolls\u00a0</em>cast mate\u00a0Anna Kendrick to perform a cover of Cyndi Lauper&#8217;s &#8220;True Colors.&#8221; <em>Trolls </em>is scheduled to hit theaters on November 4th, while the soundtrack will be released on September 23rd.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/justin-timberlake-talks-new-album-the-weeknd-collaboration/\">Justin Timberlake Talks New Album, The Weeknd Collaboration</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com\">Rolling Stone India</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://rollingstoneindia.com/justin-timberlake-talks-new-album-the-weeknd-collaboration/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Nagaland Bands Head to Delhi and Mumbai for Monthly Gigs</title>\n\t\t<link>http://rollingstoneindia.com/nagaland-bands-head-to-delhi-and-mumbai-for-monthly-gigs/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://rollingstoneindia.com/nagaland-bands-head-to-delhi-and-mumbai-for-monthly-gigs/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 14:45:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Riddhi Chakraborty]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Artists]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Events]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Home Flashbox]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Music]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News & Updates]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Alobo Naga & The Band]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Divine Intervention]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hard Rock Cafe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hard Rock Rising]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://rollingstoneindia.com/?p=65685</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The state\u2019s government has partnered with Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 to bring more attention to artists from the North East</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/nagaland-bands-head-to-delhi-and-mumbai-for-monthly-gigs/\">Nagaland Bands Head to Delhi and Mumbai for Monthly Gigs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com\">Rolling Stone India</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_21039\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-21039\" src=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Alobo-Naga.-Betoka-Swu1-480x324.jpg\" alt=\"Alobo Naga &amp; The Band.

Closer home, Thiruvananthapuram-based musician John Anthony and his fusion music band Karnatriix are performing a special set at schools and colleges across India, concentrating on raising environmental awareness.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, more than ever, we must put all our energies into raising awareness about climate change, about clean air, about clean rivers and the role of rich biodiverse forests in sustaining life on the planet,\u201d says Anthony on the reason for launching the Kadamma Music Outreach Program by Karnatriix. He adds, \u201cWe must do that by first acknowledging and celebrating the spirit of the forests, the life giving nature of Kadamma [&#8216;Mother Forest&#8217; in Malayalam].&#8221; The project is a two-hour show interspersed with messages by environmental experts.</p>\n<p>Anthony has been involved with green campaigns from as early as 2000; the first was in Chennai for eco-activist organization Greenpeace&#8217;s environmentally friend ship the Rainbow Warrior, when they came to India in connection with the No More Bhopals Campaign for environmental justice. With a strong belief that music has a unique role to play in such issues, Anthony feels now is when much needed conversations about the state of nature must begin. \u201cThis is not a lecture on environmental protection but a celebration of our forests and rivers with music,\u201d he explains.</p>\n<p>Karnatriix did a locomotive tour in April in connection with their own Kadamma Research Foundation and the Southern Railways, playing across seven railway stations in Kerala in a span of two days in order to raise awareness about railway safety and cleanliness. They also planted a mango tree in every station and roped in fellow city-based artist and designer Pavi Sankar for live painting during their performances. The two-day awareness program was followed by a concert which took place right outside Thiruvananthapuram railway station.</p>\n<p>In addition to shows across schools and colleges, the band is joining hands with the Kerala Forest Department to write a song and film a music video in May. This will be followed by series of gigs leading up to the main event on <span data-term=\"goog_1362858660\">June 5th</span>, to mark World Environmental Day.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/karnatriix-plan-special-set-for-upcoming-tour/\">Karnatriix Plan Special Set for Upcoming Tour</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com\">Rolling Stone India</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://rollingstoneindia.com/karnatriix-plan-special-set-for-upcoming-tour/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Tesseract Announce Two-Disc Live Album</title>\n\t\t<link>http://rollingstoneindia.com/tesseract-announce-two-disc-live-album/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://rollingstoneindia.com/tesseract-announce-two-disc-live-album/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 10:40:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Rolling Stone India]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Albums]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Artists]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Home Flashbox]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Music]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[New Music]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News & Updates]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Gojira]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[tesseract]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://rollingstoneindia.com/?p=65679</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\u2018The Polaris Tour Edition' album will also feature reworked versions of songs from the UK metallers\u2019 latest album</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/tesseract-announce-two-disc-live-album/\">Tesseract Announce Two-Disc Live Album</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com\">Rolling Stone India</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_65680\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-65680\" src=\"http://rollingstoneindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TESSERACT_100615_314-480x320.jpg\" alt=\"Tesseract.

She returned Tuesday carrying a glass of lemonade, which her co-hosts hinted at as a reference to Beyonc\u00e9&#8217;s <em>Lemonade</em>, an album about a husband&#8217;s infidelity. &#8220;I&#8217;m doing great,&#8221; she said to the audience during an opening segment. &#8220;I really, really am. I honestly am empowered and I have found this inner strength. I can handle this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unconfirmed reports claimed Ozzy had cheated on Sharon with a hairdresser, but Sharon would not confirm or deny the claims. &#8220;I honestly at this point today have no idea what I&#8217;m doing with the rest of my life,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I just need to time to think about myself, and what do I want for the rest of my life. [I&#8217;m] getting to the last chapter of my life.
