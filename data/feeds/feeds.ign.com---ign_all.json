As far as major, season-ending conflicts go, Penny and Leonard deciding to get married again doesn\u2019t rank high on the list. \u201cThe Convergence Convergence\u201d found some humor in exploring the dynamic among Leonard and Sheldon\u2019s parents, but it hardly felt season finale-worthy.\n</p><p>That fact was all the more glaring considering that this episode was essentially the second half of a two-part storyline. It\u2019s rare to see a new episode spring so directly from the one that preceded it, but this one kicked off with Penny basking in the knowledge that she finally bonded with the stone cold Beverly and Leonard facing the fact that he just got roped into another wedding ceremony.\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/13/the-big-bang-theory-the-convergence-convergence-review\">Continue reading&hellip;</a></p>]]></content:encoded>\r\n      <media:content height=\"405\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"720\" url=\"http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2016/05/960-720x405.jpg\">\r\n        <media:description type=\"html\">id=</media:description>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Jesse Schedeen</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-13T04:21:34Z</dc:date>\r\n    <feedburner:origLink>http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/13/the-big-bang-theory-the-convergence-convergence-review</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>The 100: \"Perverse Instantiation - Part One\" Review</title>\r\n      <link>http://feeds.ign.com/~r/ign/all/~3/qr8e-noJLFA/the-100-perverse-instantiation-part-one-review</link>\r\n      <description>All hands were on deck in the fight against Alie in the penultimate episode of Season 3.</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 03:47:41 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">57352d8efca8633caaab9e53</guid>\r\n      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Warning: Full spoilers for the episode below.</em>\n</p><p>Well, damn, that was intense, huh? The penultimate episode of The 100: Season 3 was a very eventful one as the fight to stop ALIE amped up and nearly every characters life was on the line by the end \u2013 some rather directly. \n</p><p>Even if you saw it coming, that reveal with Jasper was harsh! Finally, Jasper was not just mending fences with Monty but also really coming out of the horribly dark place he\u2019d been in since Season 2 ended and saying he was done blaming everyone\u2026 and then he freaking stabbed Monty and it turned out he\u2019d taken the damn chip. \n</p><p>I was glad they had Jasper fill in the blanks here about taking the chip after what happened in the last episode. It tracked, given how he had been acting, though it also meant Jasper had really crossed a line \u2013 because yes, he\u2019s right about misery and death following him and his friends everywhere but he\u2019s seen how dangerous Alie and her followers are. So by joining them, he was actively putting his friends lives in jeopardy, which was made clear by him nearly killing his best friend. \n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/13/the-100-perverse-instantiation-part-one-review\">Continue reading&hellip;</a></p>]]></content:encoded>\r\n      <dc:creator>Eric Goldman</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-13T03:47:41Z</dc:date>\r\n    <feedburner:origLink>http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/13/the-100-perverse-instantiation-part-one-review</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>DC's Legends of Tomorrow: \"Destiny\" Review</title>\r\n      <link>http://feeds.ign.com/~r/ign/all/~3/1-QQYxlJDu0/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-destiny-review</link>\r\n      <description>With the season finale almost here, the battle against Vandal Savage took a critical turn this week.</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 03:18:52 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">573512ef71f4c404768a8c0a</guid>\r\n      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Warning: Full spoilers for the episode below.</em>\n</p><p>Legends of Tomorrow\u2019s first season has been a flawed experience at best, with a lot more ups and downs than either Arrow or The Flash grappled with in their respective first seasons. That said, the series has finally seemed to find its footing in recent weeks. There\u2019s been a noticeable uptick in quality with this last string of episodes leading into the finale. The show has found the forward drive and impetus it lacked early on, and that fact only became more evident with this penultimate installment.\n</p><p>The deck was certainly stacked against our heroes this week. Savage has returned to 2166 with the captive Kendra and Carter in tow. Jax was stranded in 2016, which meant Professor Stein was slowly dying as a result. Mick faced imminent brainwashing and a life of servitude to the Time Masters, while the rest of his teammates faced only death. And all the while, Rip was burdened by the revelation that his entire crusade was nothing more than a cog in a vast machine being controlled by the Time Masters.\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/13/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-destiny-review\">Continue reading&hellip;</a></p>]]></content:encoded>\r\n      <media:content height=\"479\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"720\" url=\"http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2016/05/LGN115a_0045b2-720x479.jpg\">\r\n        <media:description type=\"html\">id=</media:description>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Jesse Schedeen</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-13T03:18:52Z</dc:date>\r\n    <feedburner:origLink>http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/13/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-destiny-review</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>ABC Cancels Castle, The Muppets and Galavant</title>\r\n      <link>http://feeds.ign.com/~r/ign/all/~3/frc-EiHUoxU/abc-cancels-castle-the-muppets-and-galavant</link>\r\n      <description>After an eight-season run, ABC's crime drama Castle is coming to a close next week.</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:06:07 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">5735204271f4c404768a8c0e</guid>\r\n      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ABC's crime drama Castle won't continue for a ninth season, as the network has decided to cancel the show after Season 8's final episode airs next week. \n</p><p>News of the show's cancelation comes by way of <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/05/castle-canceled-by-abc-after-8-seasons-1201750347/\" target=\"_blank\">Deadline</a>, who notes the decision is a surprising one, coming shortly after ABC negotiated new deals for Nathan Fillion, Seamus Dever and\u00a0Jon Huertas to return for a potential ninth season.
