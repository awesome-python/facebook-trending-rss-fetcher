But the number of procedures has spiked in other countries lacking access to modern methods of contraception]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A new analysis of global abortions shows a stark and troubling divide between what&#8217;s happening in wealthier, developed countries versus their their poorer and less developed counterparts.</p>\n<p>The paper, published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet, represents the most comprehensive analysis ever conducted on the subject. Worldwide, it shows, an average 56 million abortions took place annually from 2010 to 2014. That translates to 35 procedures per every 1,000 women of childbearing age, which means that roughly 3.5 percent of women in this age group had an abortion.</p>\n<p>The numbers are significantly less than a decade earlier &#8212; from 1990 to 1994, there were on average 40 abortions annually per every 1,000 women &#8212; and should be a cause for celebration for many in the reproductive health field as well as for those who oppose abortion. But Gilda Sedgh, a principal research scientist with the Guttmacher Institute in New York and lead author of the study, cautioned in a call with reporters that &#8220;the global picture masks differences between the developed and developing world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>No matter how you crunch the numbers about the developed world, which includes the United States, abortions are falling. Rates have been declining for 25 years and are now at a historic low. There were 27 abortions per 1,000 women in 2010 to 2014, down from 40 per 1,000 in 1990 to 1994. Likewise, the total number of abortions fell from 12 million to 7 million.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>Restrictive abortion laws do not limit the number of abortions</p></blockquote>\n<p>But in developing countries during the same period, abortions went from 39 to 37 per 1,000 women while the total number of procedures spiked from 39 million to 50 million annually &#8212; a situation that the authors blame on lack of access to modern methods of contraception that could have reduced unwanted pregnancies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think this is because the desire for small families and precisely timed births has outpaced the uptake of contraceptive use,&#8221; Sedgh said.</p>\n<p>The study was based on statistical modeling of information collected from national surveys, official government statistics and other published and unpublished studies and was funded by various countries as well as the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the United Nations.</p>\n<p>Among the other major findings are that three-fourths of abortions took place among married women, challenging the popular notion that most abortions are sought by unwed teens.</p>\n<p>Eastern Europe was the standout with the biggest drop in abortion rates, from 88 to 42 per 1,000 women. Rates also fell in southern Europe, from 38 to 26; in northern Europe, from 22 to 18; and in North America, from 25 to 17.</p>\n<p>Researchers said western Europe was the only studied region with an increase in its abortion rate, which they said might have been because of a growing foreign-born population.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/man-who-killed-three-in-planned-parenthood-shooting-declared-mentally-incompetent-for-trial\">Man who killed three in Planned Parenthood shooting declared mentally incompetent for trial</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/barbara-kay-unborn-babies-will-stay-persons-in-fact-but-not-in-law\">Barbara Kay: Unborn babies will stay persons in fact, but not in law</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/colorado-woman-sentenced-to-100-years-for-cutting-fetus-from-strangers-womb\">Colorado woman sentenced to 100 years for cutting fetus from stranger\u2019s womb</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>Beyond providing a breakdown on abortion around the world by major region, the study also touched on the sensitive legal and ethical debates about the procedure by breaking out numbers for the 58 countries where it is illegal or permitted only to save a woman&#8217;s life. The authors noted that the rate in those countries &#8212; representing most of South America, Africa and the Middle East &#8212; is 37 per 1,000. That&#8217;s &#8220;essentially&#8221; no different from the 34 per 1,000 rate in the 63 countries where abortion is legal.</p>\n<p>The authors  emphasized that these findings suggest that &#8220;restrictive abortion laws do not limit the number of abortions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a commentary piece also published by The Lancet, associate professor Diana Greene Foster of the University of California at San Francisco was critical of this reasoning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The obvious interpretation is that criminalizing abortion does not prevent it but, rather, drives women to seek illegal services or methods. But this simple story overlooks the many women who, in the absence of safe legal services, carry unwanted pregnancies to term,&#8221; Greene Foster said. She argued that it does not make sense to assume &#8220;a one-for-one exchange of illegal abortion for legal abortion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The paper&#8217;s findings are consistent with other data released in recent years that show a positive trend in the reduction in unwanted pregnancies and births. This month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the birth rate among American teenagers &#8212; which was at crisis levels in the 1990s &#8212; had fallen to an all-time low and that the decline impacted all regions and all races.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>The global picture masks differences between the developed and developing world</p></blockquote>\n<p>While various cultural, educational and economic factors have been debated as reasons why some groups have higher rates of abortion than others, many physicians, researchers, women&#8217;s right advocates and public health officials appear to now agree on a core factor: access to modern methods of birth control.</p>\n<p>The past 10 years have been breakthrough ones for contraceptive innovations; women can now avail themselves of all kinds of  long-lasting, low-risk implantable and injectable alternatives to the daily pill. Yet much of this information and the availability of the new methods haven&#8217;t filtered down to developing parts of the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Clearly, efforts have to focus on these regions,&#8221; said Bela Ganatra of the World Health Organization, who co-authored the study. She added that health officials recognize that not all unsafe abortions can be prevented by increasing access to contraception because some women are seeking the procedure due to rape or the failure of contraceptives or other factors. Another study is underway to try to ascertain more information about the situations that result in a safe or unsafe abortion, she said.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/hkg2005070746992.jpg?w=620\" title=\"HKG2005070746992\" Abstract=\"Pregnant women sit waiting for their turn for a medical check at Ho Chi Minh City&#039;s Tu Du hospital in Vietnam. \" Credit=\"Hoang Dinh Nam / AFP via Getty Images\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/hkg2005070746992.jpg?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/hkg2005070746992.jpg?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">HKG2005070746992</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>As Dad&#8217;s health proxy, I didn&#8217;t do a very good job</title>\n\t\t<link>http://news.nationalpost.com/health/as-dads-health-proxy-i-didnt-do-a-very-good-job</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://news.nationalpost.com/health/as-dads-health-proxy-i-didnt-do-a-very-good-job#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:02:12 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Cindy Brach, Washington Post]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Brain and Nerve Health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Health and Fitness]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Stroke]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://news.nationalpost.com/?p=1100007</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Some people would argue that stroke treatment should not be subject to shared decision-making.

He responded well to the hormone treatments, but by May 2014 his prostate had gotten so large that he had difficulty peeing. Although he liked saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to brag, but I have a HUUUGE prostate,&#8221; this condition had become dangerous; the blockage began to cause <a href=\"http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/condition/getcondition/Chronic-Renal-Failure\" target=\"_blank\">kidney failure</a>.</p>\n<p>My dad&#8217;s urologist gave him two choices: He could either live with a catheter (a tube inserted into his bladder) for the rest of his life, or he could have surgery to trim his prostate to create a channel for the pee. After hearing that sporting a catheter would end his table tennis career and that he&#8217;d have to spend only one night in the hospital if he chose surgery, my dad overcame a long-standing fear of germs and elected to have the surgery.</p>\n<p>Because my mother&#8217;s immune system was shot from having <a href=\"http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/healthfeature/gethealthfeature/Cancer-and-Chemotherapy\" target=\"_blank\">chemotherapy</a> for <a href=\"http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/condition/getcondition/Non-Hodgkins-Lymphoma\" target=\"_blank\">lymphoma</a>, mine were the boots on the ground at the hospital. Despite not being a clinician, I felt well equipped by my almost 20 years working for the <a href=\"http://www.ahrq.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</a> to serve as my father&#8217;s health-care proxy.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/surviving-a-stroke-means-knowing-the-symptoms-and-acting-quickly\">Surviving a stroke means knowing the symptoms \u2014 and acting quickly</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/canadian-doctors-missing-sometimes-glaring-signs-of-stroke-medical-legal-analysis-shows\">Canadian doctors missing sometimes glaring signs of stroke, medical-legal analysis shows</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>The surgery went well, but the next day there was too much blood in my dad&#8217;s pee. He had to stay in the hospital an extra day so they could flush the blood out while the catheter was still in place.</p>\n<p>On his third day in the hospital, my father was pronounced ready for a &#8220;voiding trial.&#8221; They pumped a liter of fluid into his bladder, removed the catheter and waited to see whether he could pee. However, my dad felt no urge to go. Even after drinking cup after cup of water and sitting with a hand-held urinal for several hours, he couldn&#8217;t get anything out.</p>\n<p>It was early that afternoon when I noticed that he was having some difficulty speaking. He was clearly trying to say something but couldn&#8217;t come up with the words he was searching for.</p>\n<p>I pointed out the problem to the urology nurse practitioner. &#8220;Dad, what are you trying to do?&#8221; I asked him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m trying to . . . &#8221; His words trailed off. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;m making an effort . . . I&#8217;m . . . &#8221; He couldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to pee.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The nurse practitioner suggested that we call the <a href=\"http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/healthfeature/gethealthfeature/Stroke\" target=\"_blank\">stroke</a> team. Although I didn&#8217;t think my dad had had a stroke, I knew I might be attributing the symptoms to other health issues, which frequently happens to stroke victims in hospitals. So I agreed, and the nurse called in the stroke team.</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later, half a dozen neurology residents were swarming around the room. One of them performed the standard stroke assessment. The next thing I knew, they were rolling my dad out the door.</p>\n<div id=\"pn_video_707439\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;Where are you taking him?&#8221; I asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To the ER to give him tPA,&#8221; the lead resident answered as they wheeled him down the hall. I knew what tPA was: Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a stroke-treatment drug that busts up clots that block the flow of blood to the brain. But I was not convinced that my dad was having a stroke.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t consented,&#8221; I called after them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is an emergency!&#8221; they replied and kept going.</p>\n<p>I stood my ground. &#8220;I&#8217;m his health proxy. You&#8217;re NOT giving him anything without my consent, and I haven&#8217;t consented!&#8221; That stopped them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; the resident said, backpedaling. &#8220;Could you come with us while I explain?&#8221;</p>\n<p>As I trotted alongside them, the resident explained that my father had had a stroke, that there was medicine they could give him to break up the blood clot but that there was a short window of time in which the medicine could be administered.</p>\n<p>How, I wondered to myself, could they be so sure he&#8217;d had a stroke? Did they know my dad had been too shaky on his feet to take a walk that morning, that he had not eaten until the nurse made him have a yogurt midmorning and that he later threw up his lunch? Did they know that he hadn&#8217;t slept much the past two nights?</p>\n<p>Could it be that his full bladder was causing his kidneys to go toxic again? I&#8217;d seen my dad get fuzzy when he had a bladder infection &#8211; maybe that was the problem. Or maybe the exhaustion from trying to pass the &#8220;voiding trial&#8221; and the worry about the pain he&#8217;d feel if they had to put the catheter back in were affecting my elderly father.</p>\n<div id=\"pn_video_442879\"></div>\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;d watched too many episodes of the medical drama &#8220;House,&#8221; but it seemed as if the doctors hadn&#8217;t ruled out other possible causes of my dad&#8217;s symptom. They hadn&#8217;t asked me anything about his history other than the time of the onset of symptoms. I was worried that these neurologists in training might see a stroke where there wasn&#8217;t one because that&#8217;s what they were looking for.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why are you so sure it&#8217;s a stroke?&#8221; I asked the lead resident. &#8220;Was there anything other than the language problem?&#8221;</p>\n<p>No, the resident answered, there was nothing else.</p>\n<p>On the way to the emergency department, we stopped for a CT scan to make sure my father wasn&#8217;t bleeding into his brain, which is a counter-indication for administering tPA. All I had heard thus far was how tPA could reverse stroke symptoms &#8211; no one had told me about any potential downsides. I asked the stroke team about the risks from tPA if my father was not having a stroke. I was told there was a small risk (on the order of 1 percent) that tPA would cause him to bleed into his brain, which could either kill him or leave him severely impaired. No one bothered to mention that the risk of a catastrophic brain bleed from tPA was even greater if he was in fact having a stroke. Or that there was a risk of a noncatastrophic brain bleed. And no one told me what might happen if we didn&#8217;t give him the medicine.</p>\n<p>The CT scan showed no bleeding. As we moved quickly on to the emergency department, I was pressed for my consent to give my father tPA.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the standard of care!&#8221; the resident kept hammering at me. &#8220;We&#8217;re running out of time.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"pn_video_911584\"></div>\n<p>I repeated that I had not consented and proceeded to call my mother. While I was on the phone explaining the situation to her, a senior neurology resident interrupted me to make sure I really understood that time was running out. I put my mom on speakerphone so she could hear what the senior resident had to say, which was what I&#8217;d already been told: that tPA would break up the clot, that tPA was the standard of care and that it was critical for my father to get the medicine right away.</p>\n<p>After I shooed the resident away, my mother gave her opinion. Maybe it was just that tPA had received good press coverage, she said, but she wanted my dad to get the medicine. So I consented. It was barely within the three-hour treatment window when they administered the drug.</p>\n<p>Shortly after receiving the drug, as my dad was being wheeled up to the neurology unit, he sat halfway up with outstretched arms, shook violently and then lay back down. &#8220;He&#8217;s having a seizure,&#8221; someone cried, at which point he seized a second time.</p>\n<p>The tPA caused my father to have an intracranial hemorrhage &#8211; he bled into the right side of his brain. Throughout the rest of that night in the neurology intensive care unit, he shook uncontrollably, didn&#8217;t appear to understand us and couldn&#8217;t communicate at all. Tears streamed down my face.</p>\n<p>What had I done? Had my mistake been to allow them to give him the tPA? Or had it been in questioning its administration in the first place and losing valuable time? Why, despite being an expert on health literacy who was developing training modules to improve informed consent in hospitals, had I been unable to come up with the questions to get the information I needed to make a truly informed choice in a timely manner?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>Doctors are the experts in medicine. Patients and their families are the experts in themselves and their bodies</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since that time, I&#8217;ve thought about what happened and how hospitals could improve.</p>\n<p>For the average patient meeting specified stroke criteria, clinical trials have shown more benefit than harm when tPA is administered within three to four hours of the first symptoms. The earlier the patient receives the medicine, the better the results. This creates both intense time pressure and the impression that there is no time to spare to consult with patients and families.</p>\n<p>The impression is a false one. There is time for patient and family engagement, but it has to be integrated into treatment protocols. The stroke protocol, for example, could dictate that while the patient is being evaluated, a member of the stroke team gathers information from family members.</p>\n<p>Doctors are the experts in medicine. Patients and their families are the experts in themselves and their bodies. The neurology residents who evaluated my father for stroke should also have been asking me what my father was normally like, whether he had ever experienced symptoms like this before and whether I knew of anything that might account for his current symptom. This time could also be used to alert the family that a decision might have to be made quickly and find out whether any other relatives should be involved in the decision.</p>\n<p>The protocol could also specify that during the CT scan, the family be briefed about the results of the evaluation, the purpose of the scan and the upcoming decision about whether to administer tPA. Had the residents taken more seriously my doubts about whether my dad had had a stroke and my concerns about the treatment, they might have told me that they had checked my father&#8217;s blood sugar level and that there was a second symptom of stroke they hadn&#8217;t told me about. Instead, valuable time was wasted.</p>\n<p>In the next step of the protocol, the doctor would sit down with the patient and family, elicit their goals and preferences and go over the benefits, harms and risks of the options, including the option of no treatment. Giving me tailored risk-benefit calculations would have allayed my concerns that the treatment they recommended was dictated by a rule of thumb instead of my father&#8217;s particular situation.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>To turn informed consent into informed choice, hospital leaders need to make clear communication an institutional priority</p></blockquote>\n<p>The final step of the protocol would be to check that the information had been understood and to help the patient and family make a choice. Everything could be accomplished in a short amount of time if the process was streamlined and roles were clearly delineated.</p>\n<p>Many hospitals do not even follow the basic tenets of informed consent when delivering tPA. To turn informed consent into informed choice, hospital leaders need to make clear communication an institutional priority.</p>\n<p>Some people would argue that stroke treatment is not an area that should be subject to shared decision-making. They would say that the science is clear and that a doctor&#8217;s objective should be to administer the medicine as quickly as possible. But I believe that patients and family members have an important role to play, even when decisions must be made quickly.</p>\n<p>My father was lucky. He got back most of his functioning after the brain bleed, although he can play table tennis only while sitting down and can no longer go outside by himself because he is a fall risk. The doctors are pleased with the outcome, but I&#8217;m dismayed with the process.</p>\n<p>When the residents gave my father a stroke diagnosis, I needed someone to serve as an unbiased interpreter of the evidence, to recognize my knowledge of this particular patient and to ask about our values and goals. I needed someone to acknowledge that we faced a hard decision, that there were no guarantees and that it was ultimately our choice. Health-care systems can and must do a better job.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Brach is a senior health policy researcher at the Center for Delivery, Organization, and Markets at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in Rockville, Md.

How do good intentions &#8211; and the investment of time and effort needed to lose weight in the first place &#8211; unravel?</p>\n<p><strong>We look for the fast track</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest stumbling blocks is quite simply dieting. Most traditional weight-loss plans call for adopting new food and exercise behaviors that you aren&#8217;t able to &#8211; or won&#8217;t want to &#8211; maintain for life. It&#8217;s about doing whatever it takes to lose weight, with weight maintenance taking on a nebulous &#8220;I&#8217;ll worry about that later&#8221; quality. One could argue that contestants on &#8220;The Biggest Loser&#8221; work harder at weight loss than anyone, and most of them have regained the weight.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we humans are wired to seek instant gratification. I see this in patients all the time. Even though they&#8217;ve already tried a dozen diets, none resulting in lasting weight loss, they are still willing to severely restrict calories and cut out entire food groups if it will help them lose weight. I remind them that if they make changes they can&#8217;t sustain, they may lose weight initially, but it will come right back. It&#8217;s better to take the time to improve food quality and learn to adjust to hunger and fullness cues.</p>\n<p>Anyone beginning to shape their behaviors with weight loss in mind would be wise to ask themselves, &#8220;Will I be happy eating this way or exercising this much for the rest of my life?&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/the-diet-fix-md-seeks-to-explain-why-most-diets-fail-charts-a-better-course\">\u2018The Diet Fix\u2019: MD seeks to explain why most diets fail, charts a better course</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/finding-the-right-diet-takes-careful-consideration-and-planning\">Finding the right diet takes careful consideration and planning</a></li></ul></div>\n<p><strong>We see a weight goal as the finish line</strong></p>\n<p>Even among those who choose to make satisfying, sustainable changes to their nutrition and exercise habits, long-term adherence doesn&#8217;t always happen. Why? One danger is treating your weight goal as a finish line. Once you&#8217;ve crossed the line, the &#8220;diet&#8221; is over, a mindset that sets the stage for regain. This is amplified by the fact that the body adjusts its metabolism as weight drops &#8211; particularly in people who lose a lot of weight. The truth is that the effort required to maintain new habits never ends.</p>\n<p>A better approach is to set goals around things that you actually have control over, such as consistently exercising five times a week or eating four cups of vegetables each day, and let weight loss be the outcome. Identify your triggers to overeat &#8211; stress, fatigue, being overly hungry &#8211; and build strategies to deal with them rather than relying on willpower. For example, plan a nutritious afternoon snack, keep tempting foods out of sight and so on. If you have a tendency to eat for emotional reasons, it&#8217;s critical to develop non-food ways to comfort yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>We diet for the wrong reasons</strong></p>\n<p>Another challenge is that the initial motivators for weight loss &#8211; health concerns, an upcoming class reunion, a tropical vacation &#8211; often fade. Compliments on your changing appearance and the need to buy smaller pants can keep the motivational fires burning, but what happens when the number on the scale stops moving? Waiting for fresh motivation to strike can cause you to slip back into old habits, but being open to new ways to eat well and stay active can help keep you action-oriented. That&#8217;s important, because action is often what primes the pump of motivation, not the other way around.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>People who think in all-or-nothing terms tend to be less adaptable to change and more likely to revert to old habits</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>We have unrealistic expectations</strong></p>\n<p>How well our expectations match reality can also affect motivation &#8211; and the odds of successful weight maintenance. People who are disappointed by how much weight they lost are more likely to regain. So are people who expect that losing weight will make them happier. The truth is that people of all shapes and sizes struggle with body image, relationships and job satisfaction.</p>\n<p><strong>We aren&#8217;t flexible</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to expect &#8211; and prepare for &#8211; life&#8217;s inevitable curveballs. People who think in all-or-nothing terms tend to be less adaptable to change and more likely to revert to old habits. This leads to deciding &#8220;anything goes&#8221; on vacation, skipping exercise if weather or other circumstances pre-empt your normal routine and abandoning healthy eating when life becomes &#8220;too busy.&#8221; Part of treating health and wellness as a journey includes always having a plan B and being ready to course-correct immediately when life briefly knocks you off track.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://news.nationalpost.com/health/five-reasons-we-regain-weight/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/woman_s_legs_on_a_domestic_scale.jpg?w=620\" title=\"woman&#039;s legs on a domestic scale\" Abstract=\"Often, the body fights back against weight loss.\n\" Credit=\"Fotolia\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/woman_s_legs_on_a_domestic_scale.jpg?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/woman_s_legs_on_a_domestic_scale.jpg?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">woman&#039;s legs on a domestic scale</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Canadians offered new way to save on prescription drugs</title>\n\t\t<link>http://news.nationalpost.com/health/canadians-offered-new-way-to-save-on-prescription-drugs</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:00:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Heidi Westfield, Special to National Post]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://news.nationalpost.com/?p=1093720</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Before he had a heart attack, Harish Arora worked at a factory in southern Ontario.

Now he and his wife are living on a reduced income and have no drug insurance. His wife needs prescription glaucoma drops for her eyes, as well as medication to keep her high cholesterol in check.</p>\n<p>The pharmacy bills came to more than $200 a month, taking up a sizable amount of their household budget. The Brampton couple were forced to make difficult choices. They could pay for their medications or buy new clothes. They stopped eating out and tried to save money any way they could.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe medicines are very expensive, but they have to be taken no matter what the cost. We do not have that much money, so we compromise in other ways,\u201d Arora said.</p>\n<p>A 2012 study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that people without a drug plan are four-and-a-half times more likely to avoid taking their medications because of the cost. About two years ago, a doctor suggested Arora\u2019s family try out a prescription savings card called innoviCares. The card is free, and is available to all Canadian residents. It helps users save money on more than 100 brand-name medications.</p>\n<p>Arora\u2019s innoviCares card covers most of the cost of his family\u2019s prescription drugs. They now have more money to spare for groceries, and other household expenses.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is a very good thing,\u201d Arora said. \u201cIt is helping people like us who don\u2019t have a lot of resources. And I encourage people to use the card to save money if they can.\u201d</p>\n<p>About 1.5 million Canadians have signed up for the innoviCares card across the country. The prescription savings card is accepted at nearly all pharmacies in Canada, and can be used with an existing drug plan or on its own.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey absolutely love it,\u201d said Dave Morton, executive vice-president, marketing at STI Technologies Limited, of the response he receives from innoviCares card users. \u201cSome of the feedback, once they hear about it, is: \u2018Is it too good to be true? Is there a catch?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Morton said there are no fees to sign up or use the innoviCares card. The free card is funded by 23 Canadian pharmaceutical companies. The drug manufacturers absorb up to the full difference in price between a name-brand prescription and its generic alternatives.</p>\n<p>Morton said the prescription savings cards provide a helpful tool for users to manage their own treatment plans under the guidance of their health-care professionals. Consumers have more freedom to choose the prescription drugs their physician has prescribed and they have come to trust.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are giving people options to make a choice,\u201d he said, \u201cand help them take control of their own health and wellness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giving patients a stronger voice in their own health care has become a priority across the country \u2014 everywhere from government planning committees to hospitals and family clinics. Recent research, including a 2011 study at the University of California, finds an increasing link between patient-centred care and better health outcomes.</p>\n<p>Michele Kolton Gillespie said the innoviCares card helped her gain access to a new treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis. The Penetanguishene, Ont., resident developed the progressive disease at the age of 33. It started in her knees and spread to her feet and wrists.</p>\n<p>Last fall, Kolton Gillespie went to see her rheumatologist. Her doctor was concerned with her recent blood test results, and suggested she explore other prescription drug options. Kolton Gillespie works part-time and is on a tight budget. The brand-name medications her doctor recommended were more expensive, so she signed up for the innoviCares card to help absorb the cost.</p>\n<p>Kolton Gillespie said that within a couple of months she noticed the new treatment option was paying off. She feels less pain, and has a better quality of life. Everyday activities that used to be challenging are now a little easier.</p>\n<p>\u201cI used to not be able to really walk or do anything until an hour and a half after I had taken my medications,\u201d Kolton Gillespie said. \u201cNow, I just get up out of bed and get on with my day. I still have arthritis. There are still limitations, but I am not walking with the pain and stiffness like I was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Having access to a prescription savings card has given Kolton Gillespie more choice of medications, and a wider range of options. She said her new treatment program is making a world of difference. Her blood results are better and she has more mobility.</p>\n<p>Prescription drug cards are one way Canadians can find the health-care solutions that work for them.

Two outside experts agreed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a finding that has plausibility,&#8221; said Dr. Ezra Susser, a <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia University</a> professor of epidemiology and psychiatry. He said other researchers have wondered whether too much folic acid can cause problems.</p>\n<p>The findings were presented Wednesday at an autism research conference in Baltimore.</p>\n<p>Folate is a vitamin found in foods that is important in cell growth and development of the nervous system. A synthetic version, folic acid, is used in supplements and is used to fortify flour and cereals.</p>\n<p>Decades ago, researchers found certain levels of folic acid could prevent major birth defects of the baby&#8217;s brain and spine. In the early 1990s, U.S. health officials began recommending that all women who might become pregnant should take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. And in the late 1990s, federal regulations began mandating that folic acid be added to flour, bread and other grain products.</p>\n<p>Those steps are considered one of the great public health success stories of the last half-century. Officials estimate that 1,000 birth defects are prevented each year because of it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>It may be related to taking too many supplements and eating too many fortified foods.

About 100 of them were later diagnosed with an <a href=\"http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/condition/getcondition/Autism\" target=\"_blank\">autism spectrum disorder</a>.</p>\n<p>The researchers went back and looked at levels of folate and <a href=\"http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/channel/Nutrition/Supplements-and-nutraceuticals/B-vitamin-complex-quick-facts\" target=\"_blank\">vitamin B12</a> in the blood of the children&#8217;s mothers at the time of childbirth. They found that 16 of them had very high levels of folate, and 15 had extremely high levels of vitamin B12.</p>\n<p>Those are very small numbers of cases. But they represent significantly higher proportions than were seen in moms whose children who didn&#8217;t develop autism.</p>\n<p>If both levels are extremely high, there is more than a 17-fold greater risk that a child will develop autism, the researchers said.</p>\n<p>Most of the moms in the study said they took multivitamins &#8212; which would include folic acid and vitamin B12 &#8212; throughout their pregnancy. But the researchers say they don&#8217;t know why some women had such high levels in their blood.</p>\n<p>It may be related to taking too many supplements and eating too many fortified foods.

I punch to a one-two count: left jab, right cross. I&#8217;m working as hard as I&#8217;ve ever worked, and even in this unheated gym I sweat as if it&#8217;s a sauna.</p>\n<p>Finally, the bell rings. It feels as if I&#8217;ve been at it for an hour; actually, three minutes have passed. The ensuing one-minute break seems to last four seconds. Let&#8217;s be clear: Boxing, even when the opponent is only a heavy bag, is a brutal sport. But brutality is needed, even welcome, when you&#8217;re facing a progressive, incurable neurological disease. I have <a href=\"http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/condition/getcondition/Parkinsons-Disease\" target=\"_blank\">Parkinson&#8217;s disease</a>, and it causes my body to just freeze up. Weirdly enough, boxing helps me get unstuck.</p>\n<p>All 12 of us in this class bear the unmistakable signs of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. I spot a dapper, cheerful white-haired fellow shaking like a leaf (tremor). Next, a balding, heavyset guy stumbling forward awkwardly on his toes (dystonia, or muscle cramping). Then I see myself in a mirror: a man in a white T-shirt, khaki shorts and Nike running shoes, standing still, seemingly paralyzed. I&#8217;m in the midst of a Parkinson&#8217;s freeze (an extreme form of bradykinesia, or slow movement).</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/high-fat-diet-may-postpone-aging-linked-to-possible-treatment-options-for-alzheimers-and-parkinsons-patients-denmark-study\">High-fat diet may postpone aging, linked to possible treatment options for Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s: study</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/meet-the-scientist-who-is-hotwiring-the-brain-to-treat-depression\">Meet the scientist who is hotwiring the brain to treat depression by kickstarting the ability to feel pleasure</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/lewy-body-dementia-the-disease-that-robin-williams-widow-blames-for-his-death\">Lewy body dementia, the disease that Robin Williams\u2019 widow blames for his death</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/i-thought-that-i-could-do-things-in-my-life-over-zombie-disease-makes-people-think-they-have-died\">\u2018I thought that I could do things (in my life) over\u2019: \u2018Zombie\u2019 disease makes people think they have died</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>Although Parkinson&#8217;s is generally thought of as an old-person&#8217;s disease, I was diagnosed with a young-onset version 18 years ago, at age 35. Since then, I&#8217;ve taken every sort of medication known to science. I&#8217;ve had brain surgery &#8211; two tiny electrodes were implanted deep in my brain to stimulate an area affected by Parkinson&#8217;s &#8211; which unquestionably have helped treat some of my symptoms. But medicine and surgery have not cured my freezing and falling, my gait and balance issues that worsen as my disease progresses: When walking across a busy street, I may suddenly, inexplicably come to a full stop as the light is about to change. Even the slightest downhill slope of a path causes me to fall forward.</p>\n<p>Exercise, researchers have learned, is essential for Parkinsonians, and since being diagnosed I have embraced that therapy. But as time has gone on, my exercise options dwindled. After hundreds of falls, which left my knees more scar than skin, I gave up running. Frozen and jerky movements meant that tennis and skiing were no longer options.</p>\n<p>So last year, when I learned about a boxing program for people with Parkinson&#8217;s, I had to investigate.</p>\n<p>A decade ago, Scott Newman, an Indiana prosecutor and early-onset Parkinsonian, took up boxing and found it improved his agility and daily functioning. He eventually founded Rock Steady Boxing, a program for Parkinson&#8217;s patients that now operates in 89 sites around the country, including the one I discovered last year in Los Angeles.</p>\n<div class=\"npImgRight\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:381px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-1098316 size-full\" alt=\"Michael Todd for The Washington Post\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/parkinsons_boxing2.jpg?w=381&#038;h=500\" width=\"381\" height=\"500\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Michael Todd for The Washington Post</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">Kiefer participates in Rock Steady Boxing in Santa Monica, California; the program founded by an early-onset Parkinsonian and operates in 89 sites around the U.S. Participants hit punching bags and other equipment and execute other boxing drills, but they do not receive blows. </span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Boxing demands balance, timing, gait speed and hand-eye coordination &#8211; all of which are challenged by Parkinson&#8217;s. The Rock Steady program also encompasses other exercises, such as squat jumps, heel walking, agility drills, raised-knee walking, trampoline work, jumping rope and skipping. The boxing portion is non-contact, thankfully, and includes work on heavy bags and speed bags, and aiming punches at the moving targets provided by a trainer&#8217;s padded &#8220;focus mitts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Does boxing actually improve Parkinson&#8217;s symptoms? <a href=\"http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/91/1/132\" target=\"_blank\">A 2011 study in the journal of the American Physical Therapy Association</a> looked at a small sampling of Parkinson&#8217;s patients who participated in two to three 90-minute Rock Steady training sessions per week for nine months. The researchers found that the patients showed &#8220;short-term and long-term improvements in balance, gait, activities of daily living, and quality of life after the boxing training program.&#8221; While these results can&#8217;t be considered conclusive proof, the reported improvements mirror my own experience. Although I have not stopped freezing or falling, I do so less frequently, and my balance and gait seem to have improved.</p>\n<p>Exactly why boxing workouts may help people with Parkinson&#8217;s is not clear. The study noted that Rock Steady&#8217;s &#8220;whole body approach&#8221; might be the key to its success, due to its &#8220;dynamic balance activities and multidirectional reaching and stepping . . . agility drills within the circuit training regimen, such as jumping rope, and footwork activities, focused on the initiation of movement and fast-paced changes in direction.&#8221; All help parts of the body affected by Parkinson&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(13)70123-6/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">2013 review in Lancet Neurology</a> made a compelling case for the role of exercise that incorporates &#8220;goal-based&#8221; components &#8211; where people need to pay constant attention to what their body is doing and make adjustments in response to external feedback. Boxing, tai chi, tango and similar activities, the review said, seem to improve the brain function of people with Parkinson&#8217;s, which improves movement.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, human movement relies on the interaction of unconscious (automatic) and conscious (cognitive) control. But in Parkinson&#8217;s, automatic control is diminished as nerve cells in an area of the brain that controls movement begin to die off and stop producing an important neurotransmitter called dopamine. This means that people with Parkinson&#8217;s must make a conscious effort to accomplish such simple tasks as walking or lifting an object &#8211; things that healthy people do automatically.</p>\n<p>Parkinson&#8217;s medications, such as synthetic dopamine, alleviate some motor symptoms. But their effectiveness is limited and they do not address the cognitive problems that many Parkinsonians can develop, which range from becoming easily distracted and disorganized to having trouble focusing or remembering words when speaking.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npImgPlain\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-1098318 size-large\" alt=\"Michael Todd for The Washington Post\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/parkinsons_boxing4.jpg?w=620&#038;h=282\" width=\"620\" height=\"282\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Michael Todd for The Washington Post</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">The boxing class Kiefer attends includes Russell Faucett, Nancy J. Murray, and Sharon Krischer.</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>The brain has a remarkable ability to adapt to damage caused by disease or injury by growing new brain cells, the review noted, and goal-based exercise facilitates this ability.</p>\n<p>Boxing training is definitely goal-based. It forces my brain to think about and then make simple movements &#8211; such as walking, jogging, jumping, bending, reaching, stepping in all directions &#8211; that a healthy person does with no thought.</p>\n<p>Pre-Parkinson&#8217;s, for instance, grocery shopping for me was a quick routine: I went to the store, picked a shopping cart, walked the aisles freely, pushing the cart and picking items from the shelves, then stood in line at the cashier, paid for my purchases and left the store. I did this on automatic pilot, my mind wandering elsewhere. With Parkinson&#8217;s, this same trip to the market is a series of challenges: Entering the store, I&#8217;m likely to freeze at the doorway, my feet feeling as if they&#8217;re glued to the ground; when I push the cart, I can take only small, shuffling steps with my weight on my toes, and I lean on the cart just to keep my balance; reaching out to pick a cereal box from the shelf throws me off balance; standing in a crowded, confined line at the cashier makes me freeze again.</p>\n<p>But Rock Steady&#8217;s training program has given me regular, hands-on practice in dealing with these sorts of movement challenges, giving me more confidence. Now when I head out to the store, I know that the mobility required to perform my boxing agility exercises exceeds that required to avoid another shopper coming toward me. Picking an object from a shelf is easy compared with reaching out to hit a heavy bag. And the distractions provided at the gym by Kanye&#8217;s voice, our instructor&#8217;s commands and my classmates demand at least as much focus as waiting in the cashier&#8217;s line at the grocery. Boxing trains me to do things consciously that once came naturally: initiate movements from my core, move my legs and arms simultaneously, plan my next move, stay aware of my body&#8217;s alignment and position to maintain balance.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npImgPlain\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1098317\" alt=\"Michael Todd for The Washington Post\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/parkinsons_boxing3.jpg?w=620&#038;h=465\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Michael Todd for The Washington Post</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">Kiefer&#039;s exercise routine includes a taxing encounter with the battle ropes.</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>What Parkinsonians call &#8220;balance confidence&#8221; is critical. It is fear of falling, rather than the falls themselves, that most limits my ability to perform the activities of daily living &#8211; to go to a restaurant, volunteer at my kids&#8217; schools, walk downhill. It is fear of falling that causes me to take tiny, rapid, uncontrolled steps or makes my feet freeze in place while my upper body keeps moving forward. It is fear that makes me do the very things that make me fall &#8211; and one does not need to have Parkinson&#8217;s to know that the psychology of fear can drive us directly into what we want to avoid.</p>\n<p>For many years, the only perceived link between boxing and Parkinson&#8217;s was that the former caused the latter; in fact, Muhammad Ali, who took far too many punches, may be the world&#8217;s most visible Parkinsonian. Today, a neurologist might actually prescribe boxing training &#8211; with no contact, of course &#8211; as therapy for Parkinson&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>So I pound away on the heavy bag, not training for a fight because I am already in the thick of one. It&#8217;s a fight for my life, and as long as there is no cure for Parkinson&#8217;s, the disease ultimately remains undefeated. But I and the other pugilists in my twice-weekly boxing class &#8211; all with the unmistakable tremors and awkward gaits of Parkinson&#8217;s disease &#8211; can at least make it an interesting, and maybe even fairer, contest.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://news.nationalpost.com/health/throwing-a-punch-at-parkinsons/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/parkinsons_boxing1.jpg?w=620\" title=\"parkinsons_boxing1\" Abstract=\"Dan Kiefer received a diagnosis of young-onset Parkinson&#039;s disease 18 years ago, at age 35.

Bags under the eyes vanish in seconds. Wrinkles disappear.</p>\n<p>Scientists at Harvard and MIT have discovered that it is not fantasy at all. Reporting Monday in the journal Nature Materials on pilot studies with 170 subjects, the researchers say a \u201csecond skin\u201d composed of commonly used chemicals deemed safe by the Food and Drug Administration can accomplish that \u2014 and in small studies of it, so far no one has reported irritation or allergic reactions.</p>\n<p>Undereye bags are just the start. You can soak the film with sunscreen and protect yourself without worrying about sweat or water washing it away, researchers said. They expect it can be used to treat eczema, psoriasis and other skin conditions by covering dry itchy patches with a film that moistures and soothes.</p>\n<div class=\"npImgLeft\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img alt=\"Fotolia\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/young_scientist_works_in_biological_lab.jpg?w=620&#038;h=465\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1096602\" /><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Fotolia</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">A scientist works in a lab</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>The chemicals are siloxanes \u2014 their basic form is one atom of oxygen linked to two atoms of silicon \u2014 which form polymers, long chains of repeating units. The researchers made a large collection of them by modifying molecular features such as the chain length to get the ones with the properties they wanted.</p>\n<p>Then they devised a two-step process. First, a polymer, a clear liquid, is applied. Its chains are not very strong, though, so the next step is applying a product that links them together. By modifying the chemistry of the chains, the researchers can alter the properties of the second skin, depending on how it will be used, making it more or less permeable, for example. A more permeable second skin might be used for undereye bags while a less permeable one might hold a medication in place. It can be removed with a solution that dissolves the polymer.</p>\n<p>The research was funded by a small, privately owned biotechnology company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Living Proof, and the product is being developed by another small, privately owned Cambridge company, Olivo Laboratories, which owns the patents. All of the authors on the new paper have an equity interest in Living Proof and so, indirectly, in Olivo.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/life/is-the-future-of-skincare-in-lasers\">Is the future of skincare in lasers?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/celebrity/baron-of-botox-dies-soon-after-devastating-caricature-of-him-by-martin-short\">\u2018Baron of Botox\u2019 dies soon after \u2018devastating\u2019 caricature of him by Martin Short</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/life/skip-the-soak-and-seven-other-dos-and-donts-of-pedicures-just-in-time-for-sandal-season\">Skip the soak, and seven other pedicure dos and don&#039;ts, just in time for sandal season</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>The report published on Monday describes pilot studies, the first test of the product.

Since dermatologists also know about hair, the company consulted him. Why, Anderson asked the company executives, couldn\u2019t there be a polymer to put on skin?</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of what happens when we age and skin starts wrinkling and sagging is loss of elastic recoil,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we move skin, it doesn\u2019t snap back to what it used to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>What if there was a way to restore the elastic nature of skin?</p>\n<p>Anderson ticked off what would be needed: \u201cIt has to be nearly invisible. The skin still has to be able to breathe through this stuff. And it needs to be strong enough and elastic enough that it actually affects the recoil of the skin.\u201d</p>\n<p>That, he said, \u201cis the challenge I put to them.\u201d<br />\n<div class=\"npImgCentre\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img alt=\"Greg Southam / Postmedia\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/dry_skin__0036.jpg?w=620&#038;h=465\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1096614\" /><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Greg Southam / Postmedia</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">Researchers expect it can be used to treat eczema and other skin conditions by covering dry itchy patches with a film that moistures and soothes</span></div></div></div></div></p>\n<p>Dr. Robert Langer, a biomedical engineer who is a professor at MIT and a scientific founder of Living Proof, started searching for something that would work. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe made literally hundreds of polymers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were looking for safety, spreadability, adherence, and the right kind of mechanical and optical properties.\u201d</p>\n<p>The \u201cskin\u201d can last for more than a day.</p>\n<p>One of the first applications, said Dr. Barbara A. Gilchrest, a Harvard dermatology professor who is part of the research team, was on undereye bags, a condition that plagues so many middle-aged and older people.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>\nYou really can\u2019t see it.

In one study, participants put second skin on their forearms to see how quickly the skin returned to normal after it was pinched in a suction cup \u2014 a test of elasticity. In another study, people were randomly assigned to use second skin or a placebo under their eyes. Trained observers graded the subjects on the appearance of the undereye skin.

Most cases involve swallowing liquid <a href=\"http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/channel/Smoking/Smoking-basics/Nicotine-withdrawal\" target=\"_blank\">nicotine</a>.</p>\n<p>While most kids weren&#8217;t seriously harmed, one child died and several had severe complications including comas and seizures.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is an epidemic by any definition,&#8221; said lead author Dr. Gary Smith, director of the <a href=\"http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/injury-research-and-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Injury Research and Policy</a> at <a href=\"http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nationwide Children&#8217;s Hospital</a> in Columbus, Ohio.</p>\n<p>The researchers say the results highlight a need for better parent awareness about the importance of keeping the devices out of sight and reach of young kids. They also recommend stricter regulation and applauded long-awaited restrictions the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> issued last Thursday.</p>\n<p>The study examined poison centre calls about exposure to nicotine and tobacco products among children under age 6 from January 2012 through April 2015. The most worrisome findings involved e-cigarettes &#8212; battery-powered devices that turn nicotine into an inhalable vapour. Some feature colorful packaging and flavoured nicotine that can attract young children.</p>\n<p>The results were <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20154155\" target=\"_blank\">published Monday in the journal Pediatrics</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npImgPlain\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-1096040 size-large\" alt=\"Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/ecig_juice050516.jpg?w=620&#038;h=465\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">Space Jam juice for E-cigarettes is displayed at Gone With the Smoke Vapor Lounge on May 5, 2016 in San Francisco, California.

Calls totalled 4,128 during the study. Most children were age 2 or younger.</p>\n<p>The cases represent 14 per cent of the nearly 30,000 calls about kids&#8217; exposure to nicotine and tobacco products during that time.</p>\n<p><strong>THE HARM</strong></p>\n<p>Liquid nicotine in e-cigarettes can harm young children if swallowed or absorbed into the skin. Vomiting, a quickened heartbeat and jittery behaviour are among the symptoms. The <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommends calling poison centres if exposure is suspected.</p>\n<p>Most exposures to e-cigarettes were managed at home. Among those who received medical care, less than 3 per cent were hospitalized. About 2 per cent, or 77 kids, had severe complications including seizures, coma or breathing problems.</p>\n<p>Most affected children had symptoms lasting two hours or less.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/it-lit-my-kids-face-on-fire-father-wants-ban-sale-of-e-cigarettes-to-minors-after-horrific-accident\">\u2018It lit my kid\u2019s face on fire\u2019: Father wants ban on sale of e-cigarettes to minors after horrific accident</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/ontario-to-restrict-e-cigarettes-ban-flavoured-tobacco-and-require-calorie-counts-in-restaurants\">Ontario to restrict e-cigarettes, ban flavoured tobacco and require calorie counts in restaurants</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/e-cigarettes-may-promote-tobacco-use-among-young-smokers-not-proven-as-safe-cessation-aid-u-s-studies-argue\">E-cigarettes may promote tobacco use among young smokers, not proven as safe cessation aid, U.S. studies argue</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/tobacco-free-e-cigarettes-are-a-healthier-choice-for-smokers-right-no-life-insurance-companies-say\">Tobacco-free e-cigarettes are a healthier choice for smokers, right?

However, the most recent numbers don&#8217;t indicate whether the decrease includes young children. He said most vaping liquid products use child-resistant packaging.</p>\n<p><strong>NEW RESTRICTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>The FDA rules issued last week will require federal review of the devices and their ingredients, imposing restrictions similar to those affecting traditional cigarettes. The agency intends to issue rules to require nicotine exposure warnings and child-resistant packaging. That action would supplement the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention law, which takes effect this summer and will require child-resistant packaging of liquid nicotine containers.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://news.nationalpost.com/health/e-cigarette-poisonings-surge-in-young-children-study-says/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0_3hld67ue\" type=\"application/vnd.kaltura\" medium=\"featuredvideo\">\r\n\t\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"\" />\r\n\t\t\t<media:title><![CDATA[E-cigarette poisonings surge in young children, study says]]></media:title>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<media:caption><![CDATA[FDA Brings E-Cigarettes under Federal Authority]]></media:caption>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</media:content>\r\n\t\t<np:featuredvideo><![CDATA[<div id=\"pn_video_525553\" itemprop=\"video\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\" itemscope=\"itemscope\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">( function() { pnShowVideo( \"0_3hld67ue\", 525553, \"\", \"\", \"true\", \"\", \"\", \"kaltura\", \"video\", null, null, \"\" ); } )();</script>]]></np:featuredvideo><np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/ecig_juice050516.jpg?w=620\" title=\"ecig_juice050516\" Abstract=\"Space Jam juice for E-cigarettes is displayed at Gone With the Smoke Vapor Lounge on May 5, 2016 in San Francisco, California.

It causes only a mild and brief illness, at worst, in most people.</p>\n<p>But last year, when Zika outbreaks were being reported in Brazil for the first time, doctors also saw a dramatic increase in <a href=\"http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/channel/Infection/Zika-virus/Zika-virus-infection-and-birth-defects\" target=\"_blank\">severe brain-related birth defects</a> in babies born to women infected during pregnancy.

Most cases are in adults.</p>\n<p>Symptoms usually start in the legs and can last a few weeks or several months. Most people fully recover, but some have permanent damage. An estimated 1 in 20 people with the condition die, usually when the paralysis affects muscles that control breathing.</p>\n<p>There are a number of causes, including bacterial or viral infections. Doctors have said it would not be surprising if Zika causes Guillain-Barre too, but scientists are investigating the link.</p>\n<p>They think the body forms antibodies to fight a Zika infection, and when the initial symptoms subside, the antibodies turn and attack the peripheral nerves.</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npRule npRelated\"><h4 class=\"npNoRule\">Related</h4><ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-confirms-its-first-case-of-sexually-transmitted-zika-virus-as-ontario-resident-infected-by-partner\">Canada confirms its first case of sexually transmitted Zika virus as Ontario resident infected by partner</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/zika-may-cause-temporary-paralysis-study-shows\">Zika may cause temporary paralysis, study shows</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/rare-neurological-disorder-causing-temporary-paralysis-reported-in-countries-seeing-zika-virus-outbreak\">Rare neurological disorder causing temporary paralysis reported in countries seeing Zika virus outbreak</a></li><li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/health/cdc-the-more-we-know-about-zika-the-scarier-it-is\">CDC: The more we know about Zika, the scarier it is</a></li></ul></div>\n<p>An estimated 3,000 to 6,000 Americans develop Guillain-Barre each year.

She also advises to try more than one variety of protein powders to avoid getting a sensitivity.</p>\n<p>\u201cCycle your proteins,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cFinish one bottle of protein, then try a different one. You need to mix things up because you can become sensitive to any type of protein.\u201d</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re choosing a protein powder supplement, Gail Hammond, a dietitian and food, nutrition and health lecturer at the University of British Columbia says there are many varieties to choose from.</p>\n<p>\u201cVegans will be looking for plant-based protein sources, such as legume (e.g., soy, pea, peanut), nut (e.g., Brazil), seed (e.g., hemp, chia), and grain-based (e.g., brown rice, quinoa) powders,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople with allergies to specific foods such as nuts, eggs or dairy will avoid these types of protein supplements.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"npBlock npImgPlain\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-1094374 size-large\" alt=\"Joy McCarthy\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/fermented_protein1a.jpg?w=620&#038;h=414\" width=\"620\" height=\"414\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Joy McCarthy</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">Sweet Potato Muffins</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p><strong>Try this recipe with fermented protein powder.

I\u2019m looking at filing for bankruptcy now']]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>OTTAWA \u2022 Leonard Briere is no junkie. The Manitoba man severely damaged his right hand and wrist in a November 2013 gun accident and joined the six million Canadians who depend on prescribed opioid painkillers to get through the day.&nbsp;But Briere can\u2019t get the drugs he says he needs to return to work as a Winnipeg-area construction superintendent.</p>\n<p>More doctors are abandoning or refusing to write opioid prescriptions for pain-stricken patients because of concerns the drugs might end up on the illicit market and worsen the spreading epidemic of opioid overdoses and deaths among street-drug users and others.&nbsp;So Briere and others like him suffer. Now, his anguish has turned to indignation.</p>\n<p>The Liberal government recently abandoned a Health Canada draft plan that would have required oxycondone painkillers be tamper-resistant and difficult to crush, snort or inject, the preferred methods of use by addicts. Eventually, all opioids would have to include the safeguard, rendering the pills largely useless to all but legitimate consumers.</p>\n<p>The news hit Briere hard. The 37-year-old picked up the phone this week and called Postmedia parliamentary reporter Ian MacLeod to talk about his physical pain, mental distress, unemployment and looming bankruptcy. Here, in his own words, is Briere\u2019s story:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"npImgCentre\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1093827\" alt=\"Lyle Stafford for National Post\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/workshop.jpg?w=620&#038;h=465\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Lyle Stafford for National Post</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">Leonard Briere severely damaged his right hand and wrist in a November 2013 gun accident.</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>&#8220;Ever since (the accident), it\u2019s been a complete nightmare. I lost my job because of it, so I started my own company. I went through surgery, but it didn\u2019t help, (the pain) is going to be a problem forever now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had a family doctor, he was helping me with meds and pain. He started me out with six Percocet a day, but for the work I was doing, it just kept going up and up. I started taking oxy 20s, (OxyContin 20-milligrams) three times a day, in addition to the percs, to manage the pain. (Briere was classified as a \u201ctriplicate prescription patient,\u201d a reference to one of Canada\u2019s prescription monitoring programs that track outpatient prescription dispensing.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019ve educated myself with OxyContin and Percocet, and all the meds, so every six months I take myself off them, I go cold turkey. I don\u2019t keep going up. I\u2019ll sit at home for a week, go through the withdrawals and be done with it. The withdrawals are horrible. You\u2019re vomitting, diarrhea, you\u2019re a mess, it\u2019s just the worst thing in the world. Then I\u2019ll start again at six percs a day. Once it gets up there (again), I\u2019ll shut &#8217;em down.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>The bottom line is, I take medication to relieve the pain so I can work and pay my bills</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;The bottom line is, I take medication to relieve the pain so I can work and pay my bills. Or, I don\u2019t take the medication and I can\u2019t work. Working four or five hours a day, my hand hurts too much, so I\u2019m sitting at home after that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You know when you get a leg cramp and it hurts really bad for a few minutes? That\u2019s what my hand starts out as during the day, and then it just increases and increases and it feels like there\u2019s someone squeezing a vise on my wrist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I got a job in Calgary for a year and I had a doctor there and he prescribed me the same medication. (Like the previous doctor) I saw him on a monthly basis to review pain and pill treatment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I moved again to B.C. for work and could not find a family doctor to take my case after visiting six different doctors&nbsp;and going through the steps of trying to get one of them to help me with no success. All were accepting new patients, just none were take triplicate patients.</p>\n<div class=\"npImgCentre\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1093825\" alt=\"Lyle Stafford for National Post\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/hand1.jpg?w=620&#038;h=465\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Lyle Stafford for National Post</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">The scars on Leonard Briere&#039;s hand and wrist bear testimony to the severe injury that continues to cause him excruciating pain.</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>&#8220;I tossed in the towel and went through withdrawals and, due to too much time taken off work creating a very unpleasant work environment, I resigned my job.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I packed up and came back to Manitoba to be closer to my son (and wife) in Winnipeg and returned to my family physician and continued treatment up until January (when the doctor closed his practice).</p>\n<p>&#8220;After visiting doctors in Winnipeg and surrounding areas, including the pain clinic, three of them treated me like a junkie and refused to help or even look at my medical charts.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>They just told me, \u2018No, you\u2019re an opiate patient and I don\u2019t want you as a patient</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;They just told me, \u2018No, you\u2019re an opiate patient and I don\u2019t want you as a patient.\u2019 I have letters from doctors in Alberta saying I\u2019m not a drug-seeking patient.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At this point I had given up and simply was unsure what to do. My&nbsp;wife had continued looking for a doctor and found one. He took some mercy on me on gave me two Percocets, five milligrams, per day along with four Tylenol 3s per day. He said, \u2018It would be inhuman to let you leave without pain medication.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;After one month, he left on vacation and did not refill my script. We found a nurse practitioner (in April) and she refilled my script for 20 days at which time I rebooked another appointment, asking her to keep the Tylenol 3s and give me six Percocet a day because the Tylenol was not cutting it.</p>\n<div class=\"npImgCentre\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:620px;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1093846\" alt=\"Graeme Roy/The Canadian Press\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/drugs1.jpg?w=620&#038;h=396\" width=\"620\" height=\"396\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Graeme Roy/The Canadian Press</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">Leonard Briere goes off his painkillers every six months, spending a week in withdrawal.</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p>&#8220;I literally just got out of (her) office (Tuesday afternoon). Now, the same thing is happening. I went in there and, because I\u2019m asking for pain meds, I\u2019m being treated like&nbsp; a junkie. She\u2019s giving me two Percocets and four Tylenol 3s a day. She tried to prescribe me anti-inflammatories, but I told her repeatedly that I\u2019ve been down that road, anti-inflammatories don\u2019t work. You know what my option was? She told me to quit my job and get a new career. I\u2019ve got 20 years under my belt in construction and I have to go pump gas because they don\u2019t want me to get addicted to pain meds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, I\u2019m thinking of going to find another doctor. She gave me a contract to sign that I would not go \u2018doctor shopping,\u2019 but I\u2019m not really wanting to sign this because I\u2019m not a drug addict, I don\u2019t need to go to these stipulations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019m not selling my meds. I even told the doctors I\u2019ll go take a blood test and you can see that I\u2019m taking these things. I\u2019m willing to do what you need me to do to prove that I\u2019m taking them, I\u2019m not selling them, I\u2019m not abusing them. And you just get the blank stare, like you\u2019re an addict, it\u2019s like talking to the wall. I\u2019m looking at filing bankruptcy and my family is starving right now because I need to work. It\u2019s crazy, I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019m so frustrated.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>To be honest, I was almost in tears in her office</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I was almost in tears in her office, I had to leave, I just couldn\u2019t handle it. You\u2019re telling me my options are to get a new job? That\u2019s what my options are? She said what about family, can they help you pay your bills? She was trying to help with my family, instead of my pain. I couldn\u2019t believe it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that there are people out there that are abusing these things and ODing. They have to come up with a different method of supplying these drugs to people so the right people are getting them and the wrong people aren\u2019t.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What do I do at this point?

The Quebec aboriginal man \u2014&nbsp;21 at the time of the assaults \u2014 didn\u2019t attend residential schools. Nor did his parents. He&nbsp;grew up in an abusive household the judge found&nbsp;was a legacy of residential school abuse experienced by his grandparents. Author Mark Wolynn was astonished to hear a court give such weight to \u201cgenerational trauma,\u201d though the judge didn\u2019t use those words. But that&#8217;s precisely Wolynn&#8217;s&nbsp;goal, &#8216;to get more people thinking in this direction.\u201d &#8220;Inherited family trauma doesn&#8217;t excuse the behaviour, but it can help explain.&#8221; Wolynn&#8217;s&nbsp;new book, It Didn\u2019t Start with You: How Inherited Family Trauma Shapes Who We Are and How to End the Cycle, popularizes the idea that we inherit and unconsciously \u201crelive\u201d aspects of family trauma that can drive our own depressions, anxieties and phobias. Sharon Kirkey of the National Post spoke with Wolynn. The following is a condensed and edited transcript.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: It Didn\u2019t Start with You started when you temporarily lost vision in your left eye. Was yours a physical manifestation of \u201cbiological trauma\u201d?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"npImgRight\"><div class=\"npPosRel\" style=\"width:200px;\"><img class=\" wp-image-1094269\" alt=\"Handout\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/mark-wolynn.jpg?w=200&#038;h=282\" width=\"200\" height=\"282\"><div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"><div class=\"npGroup\"><span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Handout</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">Author Mark Wolynn</span></div></div></div></div>\n<p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;It was physical and emotional. I had the bad kind (of central serous retinopathy), the five per cent kind where it can lead to becoming legally blind.&nbsp;I was terrified. Western medicine didn\u2019t have any answers. I tried supplements, vitamins, juice fasts and hands on healing. Nothing worked.</p>\n<p>And then I went on a search to find the deeper meaning. This search leads me halfway around the globe to study with some pretty profound teachers (including a guru in Indonesia, who had Wolynn meditate, blindfolded and ear-plugged, on a small mat for 72 hours). They taught me some fundamental principles, one of which was to go home and heal my relationship with my parents, which was completely broken.</p>\n<p>Each of my grandparents was orphaned in some way. Three of them lose their mothers when they\u2019re babies or toddlers; the fourth loses her father when she\u2019s one, so ultimately she loses her mother\u2019s attunement as well. Basically this pattern of being broken from a mother\u2019s love has been passed down through my family. I grew up with this feeling of, \u2018everything\u2019s a catastrophe.\u2019</p>\n<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;Much of what you write is rooted in the field of epigenetics \u2014&nbsp;how the environment, notably in the womb before we are born, can cause certain genes to switch on or off, affecting our behaviour. But critics say this can pin a lot of the blame on mothers.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>It isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault. (But) the experience of stress is stored in the body and transmitted to the children. So when we have a trauma, it changes us. It creates a chemical change in our DNA that can make the genes begin to function in a new way.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say our grandparents and parents come from a war-torn country with bombs and bullets. It has given them a skill set to protect themselves \u2014 to duck, run for cover, have very quick reactions or reflexes. But if we\u2019re born in a safe environment, where bombs aren\u2019t going off, but our body is always on hyper arousal, always reacting as though something terrible could happen, that can be damaging.</p>\n<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;When did you start seeing signs of \u201cinherited trauma\u201d in your own practice?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> It\u2019s in our language. We say things that are not in context with our life experience.</p>\n<p>In one early case, this woman comes to me, and she\u2019s a cutter. She cuts so deeply into her leg and abdomen and arms that she hits bone. She needs to be hospitalized for infections. She has a lovely mum, a lovely dad and a lovely childhood. I said, \u2018Tell me, what you think about right before you cut?\u2019 And she said these strange words: \u201cI deserve to die.\u201d I\u2019m thinking, \u2018She\u2019s 24. What did she do?\u2019 I began to poke around in her family history and she told me her grandmother, who was an alcoholic, drove drunk. Grandpa is in the passenger seat. Grandma hits a telephone poll. Grandpa goes through the windshield and gets cut, deeply, and dies. Bleeds to death going through the windshield. And grandma feels like she deserves to die. It\u2019s speculation. But when I worked with her, with that trauma, she stopped cutting.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Skeptics might say this sounds like pseudo-science. What\u2019s the reaction when you present your theories?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Some of these ideas are challenging. One of the biggest movements in epigenetics is coming from (Mount Sinai School of Medicine neuroscientist) Rachel Yehuda. She showed that Holocaust survivors and their children share similar trauma symptoms \u2014 specifically, low levels of (the stress hormone) cortisol. Then she finds the same patterns in children born to pregnant mothers who went on to get PTSD after the World Trade Center attacks in 9/11.</p>\n<p>Biological inheritance may be a reality but it doesn&#8217;t have to be our destiny. We can change these patterns. We have to first make the link. The sad part is that many of us walk around without a clue. We just think we\u2019re the problem.</p>\n<p><em>\u2022 Email: <a href=\"mailto:skirkey@postmedia.com\">skirkey@postmedia.com</a> | Twitter: <a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"http://twitter.com/sharon_kirkey\">sharon_kirkey</a></em></p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://news.nationalpost.com/health/can-trauma-be-passed-through-generations-author-says-making-link-to-past-may-be-key-to-healing/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<np:ptpl>std</np:ptpl><atom:link rel=\"enclosure\" type=\"image/jpeg\" href=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/trauma-1.jpg?w=620\" title=\"trauma-1\" Abstract=\"Biological inheritance of trauma may be a reality but it\u2019s not our destiny, author Mark Wolynn says.\" Credit=\"Fotolia\"  />\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/trauma-1.jpg?w=140\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/05/trauma-1.jpg?w=140\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">trauma-1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/mark-wolynn.jpg?w=100\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Handout</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>",
