It undermines trust in government and erodes the ethical standards of private citizens,\" Lagarde added.<br><br>The paper, titled \"Corruption: Costs and Mitigating Strategies,\" follows Lagarde's warning to Ukraine in February that the IMF would halt its $17.5-billion bailout for the strife-torn eastern European country unless it takes stronger action to fight corruption, including new governance reforms.<br><br>Lagarde is due to participate in a British government-sponsored anti-corruption summit in London on Thursday that will include U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and other senior officials including the presidents of Nigeria and Afghanistan.<br><br>Extrapolating from 2005 World Bank research, the paper estimated that around 2 percent of global gross domestic product is now paid in bribes annually. But it said corruption's indirect costs are substantially higher, reducing government revenues by encouraging tax evasion and reducing incentives to pay taxes, leaving less money available for public investments in infrastructure, health care and education.<br><br>While some argue that bribes are simply grease for the wheels of commerce, the IMF said that corruption often drives investment away from countries where it is rife and boosts lending costs.<br><br>Without naming any particular countries, the IMF said that dependence on non-renewable natural resources can often encourage corruption, as well as conflicts over control of them.<br><br>In helping its 189 member countries design and implement anti-corruption strategies, the Fund said it emphasizes the need for both appropriate incentives and deterrents.<br><br>The paper said stronger anti-corruption laws and prosecution capacity was needed, but also said that reduced regulations can limit bribe opportunities and provide companies more opportunity to grow without them.<br><br>\"Wherever discretion is granted to an official regarding the approval of an economic activity, there is a risk that this discretion will be abused,\" Lagarde wrote.<br><br><br>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/global-corruption-costs-trillions-in-bribes-lost-growth---imf-news-finance-qfmri1hgdcgbj.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/the-sooner-rajan-is-sent-back-to-chicago-the-better-swamy-news-finance-qfmqRVejfggcd.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 12 May 2016 16:53:57 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[The sooner Rajan is sent back to Chicago, the better: Swamy]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qcextydjgeghd.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI: BJP leader Subramanian Swamy today suggested that Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan be removed from the post as he was responsible for \"unemployment and collapse\" of industrial activity.<br><br>\"In my opinion, RBI Governor is not appropriate for the country.

Increasing provisions to cover rising bad loans are likely to hurt banks' profits and curb credit growth, stoking a vicious circle of lower economic growth triggering more defaults and choking off business investment and production.<br><br>Indeed, banks' loan growth at 10.7 percent in the last fiscal year ended March 31, was the slowest in nearly two decades, partly on lower lending to debt-heavy sectors such as iron and steel that account for the lion's share of bad debt.<br><br>Profits at most lenders have also taken a hit in the past six months as they set aside a higher sum to cover for defaults after a clean-up exercise ordered by the RBI.<br><br>\"The banks need to keep provision covers high,\" said Abhishek Bhattacharya, a director at Fitch's Indian affiliate, India Ratings and Research. \"That all points to the fact that the earnings should continue to be under pressure.\"<br><br>Bhattacharya estimates about 13 trillion rupees ($195 billion), or a fifth, of bank loans are already stressed - bigger than the size of New Zealand's economy.<br><br>That compares with 8.06 trillion rupees of distressed loans reported as of December or 11.5 percent of India's entire bank debt, meaning more pressure on profits.<br><br>Rajan, who wants banks to fully disclose and provide for bad debt by March 2017, is calling for \"deep surgery\" to clean up the balance sheets.<br><br>Investors and analysts have long suspected that Indian lenders, especially the dominant state-run banks, are not disclosing the true extent of their troubled loans to avoid having to raise provisions.<br><br>But granular details released for the first time last month by ICICI BankBSE 3.46 % and Axis BankBSE -1.19 % - India's no. 1 and no. 3 private sector lenders respectively - highlighted the depth of the problem.<br><br>Axis Bank disclosed it had put 226 billion Indian rupees of its loans on a 'watch list', and was expecting 60 percent of those to default within two years.

Certainly, as an emerging market central bank regulator, I see that foreign banks have stopped opening branches because our credit rating is BAA, which implies higher risk.

Some have blamed banks for going too easy on corporate tycoons, and do not want taxpayers propping up the struggling banking sector.<br><br>The proposal, being examined by the government and in its early stages, would give the panel power to define the \"haircut\" a bank should face on a loan gone sour, protecting bankers from critics who want failed Indian firms to pay back in full, two finance ministry and two central bank officials said.<br><br>Bad debt has hampered banks' ability to lend, threatening to throttle a nascent economic recovery.<br><br>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made repairing bank balance sheets his administration's \"top-most priority,\" a senior government official said.<br><br>\"Banks have been very reluctant to take a haircut where they face newspaper criticism,\" said a second senior official, who is familiar with discussions on the panel. He declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.<br><br>The second official added that the proposal had run into hurdles already, however, amid questions over how it would fit into India's existing legal framework.<br><br>A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the proposal.<br><br>Fear of bad headlines was one reason why state-run banks declined to consider embattled tycoon Vijay Mallya's offer to pay up to $900 million in tranches to settle about $1.4 billion his defunct Kingfisher Airlines owed, two banking sources said.<br><br>Mallya now also faces a money laundering investigation.<br><br>Mallya told the Financial Times late last month that he wanted a \"reasonable\" settlement that he could afford and banks could justify. He has denied any wrongdoing.<br><br>Bad loans have piled up as subdued consumer demand hits corporate earnings, making it harder for big businesses to repay loans.<br><br><b>GAPING CAPITAL HOLE</b><br><br>RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has set a deadline of March 2017 for banks to clean up their books, and the government said it would inject $11 billion in state banks by March 2019 to help them repair their balance sheets.<br><br>India Ratings and Research, a local affiliate of Fitch, has said the government would have to cough up as much as $45 billion if the lenders failed to raise funds from markets to address expected future capital shortfalls.<br><br>Negotiated settlements, in which a bank takes a writedown on a loan gone bad, can help speed up the process. They would allow banks to more quickly establish how much money they would need to bolster their balance sheets.<br><br>All state lenders including State Bank of India (SBI), the largest, are trading at a steep discount to their book values.

A transcript of the call was placed on the bank website late on Monday evening.</p><p>One of the major factors for the red ink on the balance-sheet in Q4 was the creation of a counter-cyclical reserve of Rs 3600 crore which was done proactively to cover for NPAs from such assets.</p><p>The bank is working to refinance under the 5/25 scheme Rs 750 crore of loans, while on the strategic debt restructuring side, the amount of loans under consideration beyond ones reported in the earnings is Rs 500 crore, he said.</p><p>Managing Director and Chief Executive Chanda Kochhar said the bank is confident of maintaining a healthy capital base with the core capital of over 11% by March 2018, coupled with the \"value in the subsidiaries\" helping it meet the much needed growth capital.</p><p>\"We are quite equipped to pursue growth opportunities as they come and pursue the action plans that we have laid out for resolution,\" Kochhar said.</p><p>The shift to better-rated corporates and concentration on the secured retail book will further compress the net interest margin by 0.2% in FY17 from over 3.37% in Q4, Kannan said.</p><p>The bank would also like to keep the share of the low-cost Casa deposits at 38-40 per cent and is also targeting to grow its SME book by 15 per cent in FY17 under the overall 18 per cent domestic advances growth target, he said.</p><p>Reacting to numbers, the lowest in over 11 years, the ICICI counter tanked 4.08% on Monday to Rs 226.95 on the BSE, whose benchmark Sensex shed only 0.7%.

The plan is still in very early stages and may not be active until next year, the people added.<br><br>The strategy is unusual not just for Goldman, but across Wall Street, since most banks simply lend to their own customers. It also carries more risk because it may be harder to vet borrowers or the assets they post as collateral.<br><br>The bank is looking to earn money from a broader borrower base as profits from traditional businesses like bond trading have slowed down. In April, Goldman completed a deal to buy $17 billion worth of online deposits from GE Capital Bank to expand its reach on Main Street.<br><br>\"Growing the lending business to a broader client base helps to offset some of the pain that has been happening on the trading side,\" said Steven Chubak, an analyst with Nomura.<br><br>Bankers involved with the Goldman plan say they are not upending its business model of catering to the uber wealthy. The typical client in Goldman's U.S. private wealth unit has an average account size of around $50 million. Those customers are where Goldman remains primarily focused, said the bankers, who were not authorized to speak publicly.<br><br>Lending to wealthy individuals and corporate clients represented less than half of the balance sheet within Goldman's investing and lending business segment at the end of 2010, but that percentage is now more than 75 percent.<br><br>The new strategy will target clientele who are lower on the economic totem pole. Sources would not detail a wealth threshold for borrowers Goldman will reach through third parties, but said they are likely to be \"mass affluent\" \u2013 which is broadly defined as those with less than $1 million in investable assets.<br><br>They declined to give details on how its partnerships with brokerages will work in terms of fees, underwriting or collateral.<br><br>Goldman already has relationships with outside investment managers where it sells its own mutual funds, structured notes and alternative investments. Loans would be an additional offering, people involved in the strategy said.<br><br>A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.<br><br><b>HUNT FOR PROFITS</b><br><br>Goldman reported a 6.4 percent annualized return-on-equity in the first quarter, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2012 when adjusting for one-time items. In its heyday, Goldman produced returns above 30 percent. The measurement is important, because it shows how well the bank uses shareholder capital to produce profits.<br><br>Goldman's return has slumped because businesses like trading are struggling to generate the type of earnings they once did. That's partly because of weak markets, but also because financial regulations introduced since the financial crisis limit the businesses banks can engage in, and require them to hold much more capital.<br><br>These new rules are pushing Goldman and its closest rival, Morgan Stanley to move further into traditional lending. It is still a relatively new concept for the two, which became bank holding companies at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, and have only focused on lending in recent years.<br><br>In addition to the third-party initiative, Goldman also wants to wants to do more \"margin lending,\" which allows clients to borrow against a percentage of their assets, and do more lending abroad. Later this year, it plans to offer consumer loans online through a new effort led by former Discover Financial Services' executive Harit Talwar.<br><br>Goldman's moves mimic Morgan Stanley's in that both are trying to lend more, mostly through the wealth channel, and that many of the loans are backed by investment portfolios of stocks and bonds.<br><br>But their strategies differ in that Morgan Stanley is lending to its own clients, after having bought the Smith Barney brokerage business from Citigroup Inc years ago in a transformational deal. Goldman does not currently have ambitions to acquire any kind of large brokerage or depository bank, sources said, and hence it is pursuing loan growth through third-parties.<br><br>Goldman has already tripled loans to its own private wealth management and corporate clients over the last three years, according to regulatory filings. It had $45 billion in loans altogether at the end of 2015.<br><br>That loan book soaked about half of the deposits it had at the end of 2015. The GE deal added another $16 billion in deposits, likely depressing that ratio. By comparison, Morgan Stanley lends out around 55 percent of its deposits and has said publicly it was targeting to grow that percentage to 70 percent.<br><br>There is danger in being too aggressive in expanding a loan book when there is tough competition for good borrowers, as there is today. Goldman's strategy may carry additional risk: because borrowers are not in-house, the bank may have to rely on other firms to vet credit histories and assess asset values.<br><br>It is unclear how Goldman plans to manage those risks.<br>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/goldman-targets-mass-affluent-borrowers-with-unusual-lending-plan-news-bank-qfclvrfdfcgdf.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/factbox---indias-proposed-bankruptcy-code-news-crime-qfcjbxbeaheed.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Mon, 02 May 2016 03:31:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Factbox - India's proposed bankruptcy code]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/pgerOwgadaecb.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[India's Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which may soon win parliamentary approval, would significantly strengthen the hand of banks in resolving a $100 billion bad loan headache.<br><br>Experts caution, however, that it would take years to train up a new class of insolvency professionals and compile debt records to make the British-style regime effective.<br><br>Here are some of the highlights of the bankruptcy code:<br><br><b>UNIFIED BANKRUPTCY CODE</b><br><br>The government plans to repeal an ineffectual, century-old insolvency law and amend 11 laws currently dealing with defaulters.<br><br>Once fully implemented, the code would seek to speed up debt recoveries and restructurings by setting a deadline of 180 days to decide the fate of a company that defaults.<br><br><b>APPLICATION</b><br><br>The code will apply to companies, partnerships, limited liability partnerships, individuals and any other body specified by the government.<br><br><b>INSOLVENCY RESOLUTION</b><br><br>For individuals the process could be initiated either by the debtor or the creditors.<br><br>For companies, the resolution process will have to be completed within 180 days, with an extension of up to 90 days if 75 percent of creditors agree.<br><br>The process will involve negotiations between the debtor and creditors to draft a resolution plan.

Moreover, debit card spends, which often keep pace\u2013suggesting increasing consumer spending propensity\u2013are actually declining.</p><p>The combination of these factors signal growing indebtedness amongst Indian consumers and borrowers, State Bank of India\u2019s Chief Economic Advisor Dr Saumya Kanti Ghosh told me on my weekly Policy Watch show on Rajya Sabha TV this week.</p><p>Ghosh said they studied the relation between credit allocated to industry and personal loans over the last 10 years. \u201cThis clearly showed that industry credit growth leads to personal credit growth and not the other way round,\u201d he said.</p><p><iframe style=\"margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;\" seamless=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HcQQU5EG6aY2NsPsJbR6TsM9xFWS6Rz6YAi7HLPBs8s/pubchart?oid=305594864&amp;format=interactive\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"371\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-family: arial; font-size:11px; width:600px; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;\">As of March, each year<br>Source: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxBiayERoDNRQnlIUE11NjdwVUU/view?usp=sharing\">Ecowrap, State Bank of India</a></p><p>Here are nine reasons why this trend might be of concern, according to Ghosh and his team of economists.    </p><ol><li>&nbsp;The overall divergence between deposit and credit growth has increased recently. While All Scheduled Commercial Banks&nbsp;&nbsp; (ASCB) deposit growth has hit a 53-year low of 9.9%    in the last year, credit offtake (or money loaned) improved marginally.    <br><br></li><li>&nbsp;Most of the incremental lending growth has been to the personal loan segment, especially housing and also MUDRA (loans to micro &amp; small enterprises). But, within    personal loans, it is the credit card loan segment that is rising rapidly.    <br><br></li><li>&nbsp;Moreover, household debt, as measured by credit outstanding per credit card in India, has been rising both in nominal and real terms (after being adjusted for wholesale    price index, or WPI, inflation). In nominal terms, the outstanding per credit card stood at Rs 8,668 as of February 2016, a rise of 15.5% year-on-year.    <br><br></li><li>Further, the real outstanding has increased despite negative inflation over the last 17 months. This shows that with WPI inflation consistently undershooting projections, the real value of nominal debt/credit card outstanding has become higher than expected.    <br><br></li><li>Incidentally, on an annualised basis, the outstanding number adds up to over Rs 100,000 per annum, higher than the nominal per capita income of around Rs 70,000. This can   be worrisome once again, particularly in pockets.    <br><br></li><li>The result does not change much even if we take consumer price inflation into account. Which means we could be seeing a build-up of financial risks that will make it  difficult for households to manage their balance sheets.    <br><br></li><li>Debit card spending is declining. One way of acknowledging a more structural shift in consumer behaviour is to see if all modes of spending are rising. Evidently, that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s only credit card spends that are rising.   <br><br></li><li> E-commerce transactions could be contributing to this phenomenon as could lower inflation. But eventually, the worry is that if you and I are buying beyond what we can   afford to repay, then there is a problem.    <br><br></li><li>Back to industrial credit, if you look at the numbers closely, much of it is not fresh loans but refinancing of existing ones\u2013or, simply put, redistribution of the same    pie. So parts of industrial credit are going into refinancing existing loans while consumers borrow afresh on credit cards.</li></ol><p>Now, let\u2019s look at the flip side:   </p><ol><li> 1.Economic momentum is indeed improving. Consumers are spending more because they are feeling good about things, which includes a lower inflationary environment and more positive outlook for the future. This could be a structural shift (which means the economy is transforming).   <br><br></li><li> 2.Strong supply push. As economist Dipankar Mitra pointed out, banks are once again targeting individual consumers aggressively. This is because (as we know) industrial credit is slow and, don\u2019t forget, there is a huge non performing asset (NPA) cloud still over India\u2019s banking sector.   <br><br></li><li> 3.The absolute numbers are still low. Before 2008, credit card outstandings were 5% of receivables, now they are just 3%. The only glitch is that even if receivables are low, higher interest can hurt those who have payments outstanding.</li></ol><p>What is the way out?</p><p>Depends on where you sit. Mitra felt the market for consumer credit is still very large and unexplored, particularly in a country where consumer credit in its current form is only 20 years old.</p><p>The immediate problem for the larger banking system is obviously non performing assets and lack of industrial credit pick up. That has to be and is being addressed inasmuch as it can be.</p><p>Bank boards have to be cognisant of rising credit card outstandings and take some prudential steps in addition to what they are already taking. Possibly, some re-visiting of consumer repayment capability is called for and tighter limits than what exist today.</p><p>Finally, watch your step. Next time you swipe, ask yourself, do you really need it or do you just want it? And finally, can you clear your credit card bills in toto when they land in the mailbox at the end of the month?</p><p><i>(<b>Ethiraj </b>is founder, IndiaSpend.org.
