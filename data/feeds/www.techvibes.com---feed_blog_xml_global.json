Interestingly, people in the United Arab Emirates are fast closing in on that lead, jumping from eighth place in 2015 to a forecasted third place this year.</p>\n<p>When looking at specific devices for connectivity, North America tops the list for the use of Desk PC and TV Set-Top Box devices and also ranks within the top five for the use of e-Readers, connected cars and smart homes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For developed markets, primarily Western Europe and North America (Canada, US and Mexico), the growth drivers have already moved to the next wave of consumer connectivity,\" says&nbsp;Kevin Walsh, Director of Trends and Forecasting at GfK. \"Wearables are leading the way, together with connected cars &ndash; and both these are providing new consumer benefits. Smart home technology is an equally significant opportunity, but expected to be slower and steadier in terms of the consumer adoption curve.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<table

It was a huge milestone for us. It launched a whole decade of excitement and this feels exactly the same,&rdquo; said ACL&rsquo;s founder Harald Will after cutting the ceremonial ribbon officially opening ACLs new space in downtown Vancouver.</p>\n\n<p>The newly-designed, $10 million dollar corporate headquarters occupies the top four floors at 980 Howe, reflecting the internal culture of the company and serving as a beacon to Vancouver tech companies that longstanding global success is achievable from British Columbia.</p>\n<p>ACL has over 14,000 customers in 100 countries around the world, and commands over 60% of the global market share in the global analytics audit category, providing internal controls that identify risk, fraud, and organizational waste.</p>\n<p>In the province&rsquo;s recent <a href=\"https://bctechstrategy.gov.bc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">#BC Tech Strategy</a>, it was said that &ldquo;The B.C. tech sector has come into its own.&rdquo; &nbsp;The new ACL headquarters is a shining expression of that, demonstrating to aspiring tech founders and the 90,000 tech workers in B.C. what is possible from Vancouver.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I look forward to continuing to grow technology in Vancouver with you all,&rdquo; said CEO Laurie Schultz.</p>\n<p>ACL&rsquo;s office design emphasizes a pride in its Vancouver roots. Local wood wall accents and incredible views of the city through floor-to-ceiling windows reflect the theme of local roots and global reach. Every seat in the house has a stellar view of Vancouver.</p>\n<p>The Transformers, a special internal team with at least one individual from every department in ACL, worked for a year and a half to get feedback and source ideas from their respective teams on more than 40 different design items. These included everything from color accents to convertible stand up desks to the types of meeting rooms that would eventually become a reality in the office.</p>\n<p>The office is full of small meeting spaces and casual areas where employees can get away from commotion. Each of these spaces has a unique design, from cozy and private gallery seating to tranquil corners furnished with acoustic seating pods designed to absorb ambient noise while facing a floor-to-ceiling window looking towards Vancouver&rsquo;s West End. Numerous caf&eacute; areas are collaboration spaces with whiteboards where you&rsquo;re likely to see anyone, from the C-Suite to the recently onboarded, get away to gather their thoughts.</p>\n<p>Notably, ACL has gone office-less, with everyone, including the CEO herself, working in the open space.</p>\n<p>A fascinating symbol found throughout the office is the ubiquitous moose. Even as you enter the ground-floor lobby of the building, the gaze of a life-sized moose statue seemingly follows you from the doors to the elevator. Tiny stuffed moose dolls appear throughout the ACL office.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Have you heard of the phrase, &lsquo;Elephant in the room&rsquo;?&rdquo; my ACL guide asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Canadian, so we thought we want people to be open to bringing up any sort of questions or issues that they have, the uncomfortable issues. We call it putting the moose on the table.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This year, like last, ACL was selected as one of <a href=\"http://www.acl.com/2016/02/acl-selected-as-one-of-bcs-top-employers-for-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">BC&rsquo;s Top Employers</a>.&nbsp; The office, with the collaborative approach taken to its design, the numerous and unique private spaces found throughout, and the effort to give every employee a window seat with a tremendous view of one of the most beautiful cities in the world, certainly reflects that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I asked CEO Laurie Schultz about how the physical space manifests ACL&rsquo;s culture, her concise response reflected this as well:&nbsp; &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s opinion matters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span id=\":1xk\" dir=\"ltr\">ACL is a job board member and is hiring.</span><span id=\":1xk\" dir=\"ltr\"> Profiles are <a href=\"/job/info\" target=\"_blank\">included with membership</a>.</span></em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:51:15 -0700</pubDate>\n      <category>Technology</category>\n      <category>News</category>\n      <category>Calgary</category>\n      <category>Edmonton</category>\n      <category>London</category>\n      <category>Montr\u00e9al</category>\n      <category>Ottawa</category>\n      <category>Toronto</category>\n      <category>Vancouver</category>\n      <category>Victoria</category>\n      <category>Kitchener-Waterloo</category>\n      <category>Atlantic-Canada</category>\n      <category>Okanagan</category>\n      <comments>http://techvibes.com/blog/acl-2016-05-12#comments</comments>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title><![CDATA[Revlo Raises Seed Round, Launches Fan Engagement Platform on Twitch]]></title>\n      <author>Techvibes NewsDesk</author>\n      <link>http://techvibes.com/blog/revlo-2016-05-12</link>\n      <description><![CDATA[Toronto's Revlo this week launched its fan engagement platform on Twitch, allowing broadcasters to create personal interaction opportunities and moments for any viewer at scale.\r\n\r\nRevlo also announced it has raised a seed round of $1.12 million from YCombinator, Extreme Venture Partners, and [...]]]></description>\n      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style=\"margin: 11px 22px; float: right;\" src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7377/26904158311_1046f8ff0b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"333\" height=\"194\" />Toronto's Revlo this week launched its fan engagement platform on Twitch, allowing broadcasters to create personal interaction opportunities and moments for any viewer at scale.</p>\n\n<p>Revlo also announced it has raised a seed round of $1.12 million from YCombinator, Extreme Venture Partners, and others.</p>\n<p>\"Viewer engagement is what makes Twitch Twitch,\" said Justin Kan, Partner, Y Combinator. \"Revlo is the best tool out there helping broadcasters engage with viewers, which is why we were excited to fund them!\"</p>\n<p>Revlo created its platform to make livestreaming more fun and personal for any fan. Broadcasters use Revlo to create a free virtual currency customized just for their community.</p>\n<p>\"It's really hard to create meaningful one-on-one interactions for thousands of people when you are only one person,\" said James Sun, Revlo's CEO. \"As a lifelong gamer, I wanted to help broadcasters create fun, personal experiences for their loyal fanbase. Happy fans spend more time and money in their favorite communities -- helping the streamer and ultimately, growing the industry.\"</p>\n<p>No regular currency is required. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.revlo.co\" target=\"_blank\">the Revlo platform</a> helps streamers and their moderators instantly reward viewers for engagement and interactions ranging from time spent watching the channel to actively participating in fun contests and games unique to each community. Fans can spend their earned currency for experiences like a personal invitation to join the next viewer game, a simple bet on what the broadcaster might do next, or even a request that the streamer play (or sing!) the fan's favorite song during the broadcast.</p>\n<p>According to SuperData Research, gaming content is a $3.8 billion industry and Twitch currently owns $1.68B of the market with 100 million fans worldwide who spend an average of 106 minutes every day watching live gaming.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:51:44 -0700</pubDate>\n      <category>Business</category>\n      <category>News</category>\n      <category>Calgary</category>\n      <category>Edmonton</category>\n      <category>London</category>\n      <category>Montr\u00e9al</category>\n      <category>Ottawa</category>\n      <category>Toronto</category>\n      <category>Vancouver</category>\n      <category>Victoria</category>\n      <category>Kitchener-Waterloo</category>\n      <category>Atlantic-Canada</category>\n      <category>Okanagan</category>\n      <comments>http://techvibes.com/blog/revlo-2016-05-12#comments</comments>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title><![CDATA[Mobify Pledges Money to Fuel Student Projects at Simon Fraser University]]></title>\n      <author>Karen Lee</author>\n      <link>http://techvibes.com/blog/mobify-pledges-money-to-fuel-student-projects-at-simon-fraser-university-2016-05-12</link>\n      <description><![CDATA[Thanks to funding from Mobify, SFU computing science student Brandon Chong and his teammates were able to develop an app launcher that assists visually impaired people using voice commands and simple motion gestures.\r\n\r\nNow, the Vancouver-based mobile technology company is donating an additional [...]]]></description>\n      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style=\"margin: 11px 22px; float: right;\" src=\"https://www.sfu.ca/content/sfu/mecs/facilities/sfu-burnaby-campus/about-this-campus/_jcr_content/main_content/image_1.img.jpg/1390344981628.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />Thanks to funding from Mobify, SFU computing science student Brandon Chong and his teammates were able to develop an app launcher that assists visually impaired people using voice commands and simple motion gestures.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the Vancouver-based mobile technology company is donating an additional $30,000 to SFU&rsquo;s School of Computing Science over the next three years to enable more student-led projects such as Chong&rsquo;s to take flight.</p>\n<p>SFU alumni and Mobify cofounders Igor Faletski and John Boxall are behind this donation, which will be directed towards student initiatives at SFU that explore and further develop mobile technologies.</p>\n<p>While undergraduate students at SFU, they created a club called Mobile Mondays to share their interest in mobile technology with others.

If you&rsquo;re looking in the news, you&rsquo;re getting a look at Trump every single day about 10 times a day, if you&rsquo;re looking at entertainment, it&rsquo;s the same two or three people that have dominated the entertainment pages,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It really isn&rsquo;t a great user experience because there&rsquo;s some things that everybody finds annoying.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s where TrumpKard comes in, says Gold. The goal is to &ldquo;give people what they want to see and not get bombarded by the same monotonous content,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You can block 30, 40, 50 different things, you pick and choose what you want to block.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Blocked items appear greyed-out, Gold says that <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trumpkard/jmmllopfifblcdndhiodhfppaooehjml?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">TrumpKard</a> originally removed articles and pictures entirely, but that made it hard to see that the extension was actually working.</p>\n<p>It also keeps track of what&rsquo;s being blocked and users can click on blocked items to make them appear.</p>\n<p>It can give a sense of just how repetitive the internet can be - Gold says that after using it for just week, the app had blocked 3,000 mentions of Trump on websites he visited.</p>\n<p>He says it&rsquo;s a way for people to consume information that&rsquo;s actually new and interesting without having to wade through the repetitive, annoying things.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t going to read that anyways, they were just going to waste time picking through to get beyond that,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p>The extension is free and Gold says he&rsquo;s not quite sure just how TrumpKard will be monetized.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:52:30 -0700</pubDate>\n      <category>Technology</category>\n      <category>News</category>\n      <category>Calgary</category>\n      <category>Edmonton</category>\n      <category>London</category>\n      <category>Montr\u00e9al</category>\n      <category>Ottawa</category>\n      <category>Toronto</category>\n      <category>Vancouver</category>\n      <category>Victoria</category>\n      <category>Kitchener-Waterloo</category>\n      <category>Atlantic-Canada</category>\n      <category>Okanagan</category>\n      <comments>http://techvibes.com/blog/trumpkard-2016-05-12#comments</comments>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title><![CDATA[Communitech Rev Launches Fourth Cohort with Five Startups]]></title>\n      <author>Trish Crompton</author>\n      <link>http://techvibes.com/blog/communitech-rev-launches-fourth-cohort-with-five-startups-2016-05-12</link>\n      <description><![CDATA[Communitech Rev welcomed its fourth cohort of startups this week.\r\nRev focuses on accelerating the sales and marketing processes for companies, and graduates include Bridgit and PiinPoint.\r\n\r\nThe five newest Rev companies have already graduated from programs such as Y Combinator, Tech Stars [...]]]></description>\n      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style=\"margin: 11px 22px;

It&rsquo;s a terrible situation, made more terrible by uncontrollable variables such as the weather, and the unpredictable nature of fire.</p>\n\n<p>The Canadian government, earlier last week, announced that they would be matching &mdash; to the dollar &mdash; any donations made to the Red Cross. The donation total has since hit more than $54 million (multiplied by two thanks to Ottawa), which will go on to not only support those affected now, but to assist in the rebuilding process for years to come.</p>\n<p>A Vancouver darling has done something to help in the efforts.</p>\n<p>Gastown&rsquo;s own A Thinking Ape (mobile game developers) launched an in-game promotion that would see all of the proceeds donated to Red Cross. Across all of their popular titles. In just 24 hours ATA was able to raise, and subsequently donate to charity, a staggering $85,069.62 Canadian dollars. Or $170,000 if you add the contribution by the government.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Being from Alberta, I can only hope that our contribution will be useful to the Red Cross, and that our friends and family affected by this tragedy will be back on their feet in no time,\" said Kenshi Arasaki, CEO.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time ATA has looked beyond their own doors, put aside the business of their own money, and given with little to no desire for return. In 2013, ATA donated to the relief of typhoon victims in the Philippines. What an amazing group of dedicated people.</p>\n<p>\"Many of us have friends and family in Alberta affected by this tragedy so it's hit close to home. We saw how much other businesses and individuals were helping and we knew we had to contribute in some way,\" noted Tayber Voyer, ATA&rsquo;s Product Lead.</p>\n<p>And the support from their players is astounding. The number of sales itself speaks volumes on the decisions made. Their message boards were afire with players being vocal in their love and well wishes to those affected by the forest fires in Alberta.</p>\n<p>The donations made by this local start-up, with a small crew and massive hearts, starts a chatter that we can only hope makes lots of noise. If these guys are doing it, you should too. Donations can be made by visiting the Red Cross website, calling 1-800-418-1111, or texting the word &ldquo;REDCROSS&rdquo; to 30333 to make a $5 donation.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 08:24:08 -0700</pubDate>\n      <category>Culture</category>\n      <category>News</category>\n      <category>Calgary</category>\n      <category>Edmonton</category>\n      <category>London</category>\n      <category>Montr\u00e9al</category>\n      <category>Ottawa</category>\n      <category>Toronto</category>\n      <category>Vancouver</category>\n      <category>Victoria</category>\n      <category>Kitchener-Waterloo</category>\n      <category>Atlantic-Canada</category>\n      <category>Okanagan</category>\n      <comments>http://techvibes.com/blog/fort-mcmurray-relief-2016-05-11#comments</comments>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title><![CDATA[Intelliware Wants to Hire the Best to Take Company to Next Level]]></title>\n      <author>Jonathan Hiltz</author>\n      <link>http://techvibes.com/blog/intelliware-2016-05-11</link>\n      <description><![CDATA[For almost 27 years, Intelliware has been developing custom software solutions for a laundry list of different clients in various sectors including healthcare, ICT, retail and government as well.\r\n\r\nThey describe themselves as &ldquo;a leader in Agile software development practices, which ensure [...]]]></description>\n      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style=\"margin: 11px 22px; float: right;\" src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7247/26852356972_f25d4ea5e2_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"349\" height=\"157\" />For almost 27 years, Intelliware has been developing custom software solutions for a laundry list of different clients in various sectors including healthcare, ICT, retail and government as well.</p>\n\n<p>They describe themselves as &ldquo;a leader in Agile software development practices, which ensure the delivery of timely, high-quality solutions for clients,&rdquo; according to Greg Betty, the company&rsquo;s CEO.</p>\n<p>The company&rsquo;s tagline is &lsquo;Delivery Matters&rsquo; and Greg says that &ldquo;it is a standard operating protocol for all staff to rally around every day. Our Agile approach to creating custom applications shines when we take on a complex business or technical challenge where no solution currently exists.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The company was founded in 1990 and since its inception it has evolved in many different ways. The two founders were scholarship attendees at the General Motors Institute, now Kettering University and their strong engineering background became the foundation for the way Intelliware builds software. &ldquo;We believe that building any software solution is a risk management process. Everything has value and everything has risk. Understanding how to balance them and apply each in the right proportion is what delivers the greatest return.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One of the reasons Intelliware has lasted and thrived over the years is their ability to adapt and use the latest technologies to keep them at the head of the pack. &ldquo;[We] embraced the need to know and apply emerging technologies while others were plodding along with heavy, costly methodologies that in fact became the barrier to delivering business value. We became very early proponents of Agile and iterative development practices.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The company has gained size and employees as well over the years and they are currently expanding. &ldquo;We have grown organically over our 26 years to approximately 100 staff. Our philosophy has been to hire full-time employees, and augment with contractors when appropriate for specialized skills or expertise. We survived the Internet boom and bust with a conservative management philosophy and by ensuring we met every commitment we made to every client.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As things get more sophisticated in the world of technological solutions, Intelliware is doing everything it can to be a leader in the marketplace. &ldquo;The dramatic increase in the pace of change in the marketplace has applied pressure on our clients to respond accordingly. In particular, the Financial Services industry in Toronto is looking for new ways to work and deliver innovative customer oriented solutions to the market faster and with higher quality. Agile software delivery processes have taken a front seat as a way to respond to these pressures to reduce risk of losing market share. As an early pioneer and practitioner of the Agile methodology, Intelliware successfully delivered hundreds of real projects using Agile. We are now expanding our offerings to provide more Agile advisory services and enable Agile transformations and implementations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Andrew Pitt, Intelliware&rsquo;s Senior Vice President of Delivery is also quick to point out that they are looking at many different development opportunities as they leap forward.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In addition to the endless opportunities for technical innovation in our field, we see a future with exciting new projects and business opportunities,\" he says. \"We are excited about taking the company to the next level, not only in terms of the number, size and complexity of our projects, but also from an industry leadership perspective. Our team is really focused on advancing Agile engineering practices and software craftsmanship in the industry.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span id=\":1xk\" dir=\"ltr\">Intelliware is a job board member and is hiring.</span><span id=\":1xk\" dir=\"ltr\"> Profiles are <a href=\"/job/info\" target=\"_blank\">included with membership</a>.</span></em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 23:08:43 -0700</pubDate>\n      <category>Sponsored</category>\n      <category>Calgary</category>\n      <category>Edmonton</category>\n      <category>London</category>\n      <category>Montr\u00e9al</category>\n      <category>Ottawa</category>\n      <category>Toronto</category>\n      <category>Vancouver</category>\n      <category>Victoria</category>\n      <category>Kitchener-Waterloo</category>\n      <category>Atlantic-Canada</category>\n      <category>Okanagan</category>\n      <comments>http://techvibes.com/blog/intelliware-2016-05-11#comments</comments>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title><![CDATA[3D Printing and Its Impact on Manufacturing]]></title>\n      <author>Gaurav Sharma</author>\n      <link>http://techvibes.com/blog/3d-printing-and-its-impact-on-manufacturing-2016-05-11</link>\n      <description><![CDATA[3D printing technology has made major contributions in different fields since its conception.\r\n\r\nWith the ability to extensively customize production, many people consider 3D printing as &ldquo;the future of manufacturing.\" In reality, this technology is already playing a critical role in [...]]]></description>\n      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style=\"margin: 11px 22px; float: right;\" src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1510/24187671266_3ace6bbcc4_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"330\" height=\"186\" />3D printing technology has made major contributions in different fields since its conception.</p>\n\n<p>With the ability to extensively customize production, many people consider 3D printing as &ldquo;the future of manufacturing.\" In reality, this technology is already playing a critical role in manufacturing with different industries making the most of it to aid their operations. If this trend continues, 3D printing will eventually change the economy and norm of large-scale production.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of 3D printing in automotive manufacturing</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/blog/3d-printing-2015-01-02\" target=\"_blank\">technology used in 3D printing</a> evolves year by year and it has come a long way since it was first introduced. It is now gaining grounds in making things easier for automotive manufacturers. We&rsquo;re not taking 3D printing an entire car here. But using 3D printers in the creation of assembly parts is quickly gaining popularity in the automotive industry. The technology provides plenty of customization options with the cost-effective factor in play.</p>\n<p>Some manufacturers are using this to their advantage. Take <a href=\"http://www.stratasys.com/resources/case-studies/automotive/honda-access\">the Honda Access for instance</a>. One of their specialties is in creating custom accessories according to the preferences of local buyers. They traditionally used CNC machines to fulfill these needs and preferences. However, this proved to be expensive and inefficient. They have started using 3D printers to make the customization process more efficient and cost-effective.</p>\n<p>In addition to this range of benefits, Honda Access also managed to improve the overall design of these accessories. 3D printing enables designers to monitor the 3D forms on a real-time basis during the design process. As a result, they are able to modify and correct the designs are required and within a short period of time.</p>\n<p>While 3D printers are commonly used to create small automotive parts, there are now printers that can produce larger parts. Some can even create wheels as big as 14 inches in size. So there have been significant developments in 3D printing for automotives and its current contributions are already recognizable.</p>\n<p><strong>3D printing for end-use products in consumer goods industry</strong></p>\n<p>For years, 3D printing has been used by big companies like Ford and General Electric in <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/30/2016-consumer-3d-printing/\" target=\"_blank\">creating prototypes of new designs</a>. The technology helps designers and engineers to come up with concepts for new products. It enables them to be more efficient in creating prototypes of those designs and then testing them. This means that it is already making significant impact in the manufacturing process of consumer goods. However, this may not be enough for adapting to the rapid changes and the high demands of the manufacturing industry.</p>\n<p>This brings to question the ability of 3D printing to create end-use products on a large scale. While this may be the case, some start-ups are starting to use the technology to aid them in the production of finished consumer goods. It&rsquo;s no longer sticking to just prototypes for these companies. 3D printers can now create items that are ideal for end-use products. The main setback is that this is so far only applicable to produce smaller parts about the size of a baseball.</p>\n<p>New Balance came up with the world&rsquo;s first 3D-printed running shoes, wherein the midsole has been produced using a 3D printer. The technology is also popular for creating customized jewelry where you can print rings, bracelets, brooches, pendants, earrings, and necklaces from 3D jewelry models. So the use of this technology could have a much bigger influence in producing fashion accessories this year.</p>\n<p>Along with jewelry, smaller items like hearing aids, earphones, and dental implants are ripe for 3D printing.</p>\n<p><strong>The economy of 3D printing and experimental investments</strong></p>\n<p>Overall, the 3D printing industry continues to experience significant growth. In fact, the market is expected to reach $30.19 billion by 2022 <a href=\"/admin/blog/edit/[http:/www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/3d-printing-market-1276.html\" target=\"_blank\">according to a report by Markets and Markets</a>. The growth rate between 2016 and 2022 is predicted at 28.5%. At the same time, some big names in 3D printing like Stratasys and 3D Systems expected somewhat of a downfall in share prices and revenue towards the end of 2015.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the cost of 3D printers is continuing to decrease, which fuels the increase in role played by the 3D printing technology in the field of production. It is especially playing a huge part in the areas requiring mass customization.</p>\n<p>This is because even smaller businesses have some more freedom to make experimental investments due to the fact that there&rsquo;s less financial risk involved. A lot of businesses may have been constrained by costs before but are now able to invest in 3D printers to improve their ideation process. This ultimately leads to higher efficiency in production.</p>\n<p><strong>Viability of 3D printing in the long run</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to all these developments and contributions, 3D printing also offers lower energy usage and waste as compared to traditional production.</p>\n<p>So it could be a much more viable option and could take over the manufacturing industry a few years down the line.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 06:55:01 -0700</pubDate>\n      <category>Business</category>\n      <category>Opinion</category>\n      <category>Calgary</category>\n      <category>Edmonton</category>\n      <category>London</category>\n      <category>Montr\u00e9al</category>\n      <category>Ottawa</category>\n      <category>Toronto</category>\n      <category>Vancouver</category>\n      <category>Victoria</category>\n      <category>Kitchener-Waterloo</category>\n      <category>Atlantic-Canada</category>\n      <category>Okanagan</category>\n      <comments>http://techvibes.com/blog/3d-printing-and-its-impact-on-manufacturing-2016-05-11#comments</comments>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
