The tales of his partying are shared, videos of his dancing go viral, he's selling us beef jerky on our TVs and he's even on the cover of GQ magazine . And now he has been given an honor that grows bigger every year: He's the cover boy on this year's \"Madden\" NFL video game by Electronic Arts.   GRONK. SPIKE. Introducing the cover of #Madden17 ! pic.twitter.com/iCZUwIAuYO \u2014 EA SPORTS Madden NFL (@EAMaddenNFL) May 12, 2016   In previous years there has been a vote for the cover, but there was no vote this year. Perhaps it was to avoid something like Peyton Hillis being on the cover a few years ago, or another \" John Scott in the NHL all-star game \" situation. But EA Sports made sure the popular Gronk got on the cover.   The stories of the \"Madden Curse\" have been overblown, because such things don't exist and the most recent cover subjects have done just fine. Hopefully Gronkowski, who has had a few scary injuries through the years, doesn't restart talk of the curse.   If nothing else, since the game has Gronk's endorsement, we know it'll be fun.   - - - - - - -   Frank Schwab is the editor of Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
