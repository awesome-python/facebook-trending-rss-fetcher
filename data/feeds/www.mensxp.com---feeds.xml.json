But, it&rsquo;s also the 13th. Put the two together and you get Friday the 13th&mdash;the one day that has gone down in history and folklore to be named as one of the unluckiest days, ever. So unlucky has this one particular date become that we now associate it with a phobia!</p>\r\n<p>Yes.</p>\r\n<p>Question: What is the fear of Friday the 13th called?</p>\r\n<p>Answer: Paraskevidekatriaphobia.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a word. Try and Google it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"All the hype around Friday the 13th\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th1-1463059978.jpg\" alt=\"All the hype around Friday the 13th\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th1-1463059978.jpg\" />&copy; Dogonews</p>\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s the deal with Friday the 13th?</p>\r\n<p>Strangely, there is no hard evidence to support that Friday the 13th is indeed inauspicious. All stories rely on hearsay. But, here&rsquo;s a little backgrounder on all things Friday the 13th because we still want to spook you out.</p>\r\n<p>While there is a lot to support in the inauspiciousness of the number 13 and the day Friday, individually; as a collective, stories never really stemmed before the 19th century.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to one theory, the date is considered unlucky because of it being the day that Jesus Christ was crucified, according to the Bible. However, there is no significance of 13 in that. Unless, you count the Last Supper which Jesus Christ is said to have had with his disciples, when Judas Escariot was the 13th one who came later. This has become basis for another folklore that says if you dine with 13 people in total, one of the 13 die within a year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"All the hype around Friday the 13th\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th2-1463060022.jpg\" alt=\"All the hype around Friday the 13th\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th2-1463060022.jpg\" />&copy; Wikipedia</p>\r\n<p>The next theory has to do with the fact that on October 13th 1989, Wall Street took a hit in what was its second large drop of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in history. It was later nicknamed as the &lsquo;Friday the 13th mini-crash&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"All the hype around Friday the 13th\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th3-1463060048.jpg\" alt=\"All the hype around Friday the 13th\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th3-1463060048.jpg\" />&copy; Huffington Post</p>\r\n<p>Another theory goes something like this: According to The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, on this inauspicious day, the church had ordered the arrest and thereafter, slaughtering of the Knights Templar. According to some historical findings, it just so happens to be that the Grand Master of the Knights&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Templar, Jacques de Molay, was indeed arrested on 13th October 1307, which was a Friday.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"All the hype around Friday the 13th\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th4-1463060073.jpg\" alt=\"All the hype around Friday the 13th\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th4-1463060073.jpg\" />&copy; Theknightstemplar</p>\r\n<p>Over time, folklore has grown bigger than fact, and people have come to believe the heresy over the honest truth. Whatever may be the case, we still do have reason to fear Friday the 13th. Why?</p>\r\n<p>Remember the Friday the 13th movie franchise that had a certain eerily-masked impossible-to-kill murderer named Jason Voorhees who goes around slashing the teenage campers&rsquo; throats, guts and intestines in lonely forests, murky lakes and shambled houses? Yeah.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"All the hype around Friday the 13th\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th5-1463060100.jpg\" alt=\"All the hype around Friday the 13th\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th5-1463060100.jpg\" />&copy; Crystal Lake Entertainment</p>\r\n<p>Add to that, the following sayings:</p>\r\n<p>1. Never cut your hair on Friday the 13th or a loved one will die.</p>\r\n<p>2. A child born on Friday the 13th is unlucky for life.</p>\r\n<p>3. If a funeral procession passes you on Friday the 13th, you will die next (Jason Voorhees was probably responsible anyway).</p>\r\n<p>And countless others, too. Just ask your mothers and they&rsquo;ll probably give you pointers to add to the list. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve even met Jason Voorhees at some point and survived to tell the tale (yeah, right).</p>\r\n<p>Anyhow, good luck getting through Friday the 13th and making it out on the other side, alive and kicking. I&rsquo;ll see you there&hellip; or not. Who knows? I got the Paraskevidekatriaphobia and will probably just lock myself in a danger-proofed room.</p>\r\n<p>Buh-bye!</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/all-the-hype-around-friday-the-13th980-1463059960_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[This Is What It Really Feels Like To Be The One Who Breaks Someones Heart ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/relationships/break-ups/30609-this-is-what-it-really-feels-like-to-be-the-one-who-breaks-someone-s-heart.html]]></link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:40:30 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Rimi Chakraborty</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Break Ups]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/relationships/break-ups/30609-this-is-what-it-really-feels-like-to-be-the-one-who-breaks-someone-s-heart.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/relationships/break-ups/30609-this-is-what-it-really-feels-like-to-be-the-one-who-breaks-someone-s-heart.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-400x200-1463058914_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Heartbreakers are generally considered heartless. They don&rsquo;t know how to love someone. They only know how to play with a girl&rsquo;s heart and move on. You might even hear jokes about heartbreakers living with huge jars of broken hearts.</p>\r\n<p>Well guess what, one can never know how it feels to be a heartbreaker unless they have been there. Sorry to disappoint you folks but at some point you too have been in the shoes of a heartbreaker, it&rsquo;s just that you never realized it.</p>\r\n<p>Imagine you propose to a girl and she rejects you, you are hurt and you feel the pain. However, on the other hand, let&rsquo;s suppose a girl likes you and confesses her feelings to you. But you like someone else and you decline her advances. The girl cries and curses you for breaking her heart. So now you have actually experienced both the roles, would you still say you broke someone&rsquo;s heart? Or you would say that you are a broken-hearted person.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"What-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-652x400-1-1463058693.jpg\" alt=\"What-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-652x400-1-1463058693.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>You will find tons of stories and advice for heartbroken people, but hardly anyone ever talks about the other side of the coin; i.e. the heartbreaker. We have somehow grown to sympathize with the broken-hearted and have immense anger for the ones who break it. But no one really knows what it feels like to be a heartbreaker. While we term them as assholes who only know how to play with others&rsquo; hearts, we never really understand what goes on in their minds. Here is what a heartbreaker feels and what others never seem to understand.</p>\r\nI Feel Sorry For You But Not For Leaving You\r\n<p>Just like we said the stories or views of heartbreakers are never shared, so we never care about them and heal our heartbroken friends, which is perfectly fine. But heartbreakers also feel sorry for breaking your heart, for knowing that they would inflict pain but still choose to do so.</p>\r\nI Don&rsquo;t Love You Anymore\r\n<p>You guys might not agree with me but just like it&rsquo;s easy to love someone, it&rsquo;s equally easy to fall out of love. So if we don&rsquo;t feel for you the same way we used to, there is nothing wrong in that. We feel the pain too and we don&rsquo;t find any joy in breaking your heart. Yet we would be tagged as emotionless jerks. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"What-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-652x400-2-1463058731.jpg\" alt=\"What-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-652x400-2-1463058731.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock/Getty Images</p>\r\nI Am NOT Breaking Up For Fun\r\n<p>When we decide to break up, we know it&rsquo;s going to hurt the other person terribly but we too are going to feel like shit. Would you stay with the person for the sake of your relationship or would you leave that person for the betterment of both? Which is better &ndash; breakup or a loveless relationship?</p>\r\nI Get The Pain But I Also Know That It&rsquo;s The Right Thing To Do\r\n<p>While we randomly go around cursing our exes, somewhere we are thankful to them too for making us stronger on the emotional front. It&rsquo;s not like heartbreakers are emotionless sadists. They know it&rsquo;s for good. P.S. we are not counting cheaters here. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"What-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-652x400-3-1463058782.jpg\" alt=\"What-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-652x400-3-1463058782.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock/Getty Images</p>\r\nEven I Have Mixed Emotions About Our Broken Relationship\r\n<p>Heartbreakers no doubt hold 100% accountability when your heart is broken. But even then we feel the pain and reminisce the moments spent with you. In fact, sometimes we might even fantasize about our relationship had we been together.</p>\r\nEven I Feel Devastated And Damaged &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<p>We never intend on breaking your heart. We know we shared a lot of memories, we loved each other and we cared for each other too. But when things don&rsquo;t work out someone has to end it. We don&rsquo;t take your love lightly, sometimes we cry too since it killed us for hurting you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"What-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-652x400-4-1463058824.jpg\" alt=\"What-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-652x400-4-1463058824.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock/Getty Images</p>\r\nI like You But I Don&rsquo;t love You\r\n<p>Not just relationships, even in terms of dating sometimes we just don&rsquo;t feel the same way as you do. We might like your company but that&rsquo;s not enough for building a healthy and strong relationship. When you don&rsquo;t love her you can&rsquo;t afford to beat around the bush or sweet talk with her. You have to tell her it won&rsquo;t work.</p>\r\n<p>So guys we know that being heartbroken is worse and not to forget one of the painful things in the world. But being a heartbreaker is not merrier. The struggles a heartbreaker goes through and yet always gets cursed for what he did is disheartening.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"What-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-652x400-5-1463058861.jpg\" alt=\"What-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-652x400-5-1463058861.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock/Getty Images</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-heartbreaker-980x457-1463058899_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[15 Everyday Things That Annoy The Hell Out Of People ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30608-15-everyday-things-that-annoy-the-hell-out-of-people.html]]></link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:29:16 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Harshleen Anand</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Today]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30608-15-everyday-things-that-annoy-the-hell-out-of-people.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30608-15-everyday-things-that-annoy-the-hell-out-of-people.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/everyday-things-that-annoy-the-hell-out-of-people400-1463058286_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Being a human requires more than breathing and eating food for survival. Today, patience and calmness are virtues that few people manage to acquire. People get infuriated at the drop of a hat, patience levels are lower than the basement of our buildings and to top it, there are these itsy bitsy tiny things that people around us do, or that the universe conspires to be done, which annoy the hell out of us. Know that feeling? &nbsp;Well here are 15 such instances which annoy us more than anything else in the world:</p>\r\n1. National Holiday On A Sunday\r\n<p>You could be a school or a college student, an employee in an MNC or a CEO of your own company, but who does NOT like free holidays? The beauty of being an Indian is the fact that we have so many festivals and so many lovely holidays. Our family outings, our vacations, even weddings are planned around them. If a national holiday happens to fall on a Sunday, we curse the hell out of the species who created this calendar in the first place! Not to forget how it annoys you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy anim-gif imwidth-500\" title=\"Everyday Things That Annoy The Hell Out Of People\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/point-1-1463058373.gif\" alt=\"Everyday Things That Annoy The Hell Out Of People\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/point-1-1463058373.gif\" data-gif_image=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/point-1-1463058373.gif\"></p>\r\n2. Colleagues Who Don&rsquo;t Smile Often\r\n<p>So you just passed a vague smile to your colleagues while walking up to your seat, not to forget that it was already half hearted maybe, but they just reply with a &lsquo;hey&rsquo; without even looking up from their screen. How many muscles does a human require to do the most basic thing in the world? You spend the entire day together, might as well start it on a &lsquo;smiling&rsquo; note, no? K.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy anim-gif imwidth-500\" title=\"Everyday Things That Annoy The Hell Out Of People\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/2-1463058893.gif\" alt=\"Everyday Things That Annoy The Hell Out Of People\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/2-1463058893.gif\" data-gif_image=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/2-1463058893.gif\"></p>\r\n3. &nbsp;Uber Surge Pricing\r\n<p>Travelling in the Delhi traffic is already a major pain in head, and our CM recently gifted us with the odd-even scheme which became a profit making machine for taxi providers. Please tell me why am I paying 4 times the fare price to go back to my own house? It&rsquo;s my home, not a flight to Goa that I am paying for. Duh!</p>\r\n4. People Who Put Empty Bottles Back In The Fridge\r\n<p>You drank that last drop of the coke, you drank all the water from that bottle, I get it. But then you lost me at the point when you had the guts to put the empty bottle back in the fridge. Is it a magic refillable bottle? Or are you trying to be Satan&rsquo;s angel? I can&rsquo;t decide, anyways too late. I hate you now.</p>\r\n5. Metro And Local Train Woes\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t even get me started on it. People staring at you until you give up your seat, people stepping on your toe in a stampede like a bomb just blasted and they are running for their lives, people who will not stand away from the door when your station arrives. Travelling in your city&rsquo;s local train is fool proof recipe to ruin your day, even before it started.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy anim-gif imwidth-500\" title=\"Everyday Things That Annoy The Hell Out Of People\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/3-1463058996.gif\" alt=\"Everyday Things That Annoy The Hell Out Of People\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/3-1463058996.gif\" data-gif_image=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/3-1463058996.gif\"></p>\r\n6. The Weather\r\n<p>The sun rays are currently piercing through our skin and our cars are like over heated ovens. Tell me how does that make anyone of us smile?</p>\r\n7. Relatives Asking About Your Marriage\r\n<p>This one is synonymous with everyone. Your annoying relatives asking you about your marriage constantly like the entire humanity&rsquo;s survival depended on your wedding! Why?</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy anim-gif imwidth-500\" title=\"Everyday Things That Annoy The Hell Out Of People\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/point-7-1463059034.gif\" alt=\"Everyday Things That Annoy The Hell Out Of People\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/point-7-1463059034.gif\" data-gif_image=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/point-7-1463059034.gif\"></p>\r\n8. Paying For 4G And Not Even Getting 2G\r\n<p>You signed up for 4G thinking the internet on your phone was now sorted and you don&rsquo;t even mind paying those extra bucks for the service. The result? Leave alone 4G, the horrendous service providers nab us of any signal on our phones! Sometimes we are even unable to make a call or use 2G on the handset. If you call the customer care, they&rsquo;ll be like &ldquo;your call is very important for us, please continue to hold&rdquo;. Thank you boiling our blood.</p>\r\n9. Wailing kids in a cinema hall\r\n<p>Are you on a movie date, sneakily holding hands, whispering sweet nothings to each other, or enjoying your popcorn with your family in the theatre? Well, there are these little devils whose parents come to cinema halls with just one aim: we are raising them back home, here, enjoy their wailing for the next three hours while we unapologetically ruin your experience.

His collection of diamonds and pearls could fill up not one, but multiple Olympic-sized swimming pools. In 1940, he was worth two percent of the entire economy of the United States Of America. This is the story of the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII, or better said, the &lsquo;richest Indian to ever exist in documented history&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Richest Indian man\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/richest-indian-man1-1463057501.jpg\" alt=\"Richest Indian man\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/richest-indian-man1-1463057501.jpg\" />&copy; Wikimedia</p>\r\n<p>Born on 6th April 1886, Osman Ali Khan grew up to become the 7th and the last Nizam of Hyderabad. He will always be remembered for the baffling amount of wealth he accumulated during his reign from 1911-1948. &nbsp;He appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1937, branded as the &lsquo;Richest Man On Earth&rsquo;. Time magazine also reported that he had his own mint, printing his own currency, the &lsquo;Hyderabadi Rupee&rsquo;. He also used the Jacob Diamond, the fifth largest in the world, worth 100 million pounds as his paperweight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-500\" title=\"Richest Indian man\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/richest-indian-man2-1463057576.jpg\" alt=\"Richest Indian man\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/richest-indian-man2-1463057576.jpg\" />&copy; Wikimedia</p>\r\n<p>Time magazine on Feb 22, 1937 reported &ndash;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Most news stories hung on the Richest Man are chiefly chatter about how careful His Exalted Highness is with his pennies &mdash; whereas $5,000 is his approximate daily income, his jewels have an estimated value of $150,000,000, he reputedly has salted down $250,000,000 in gold bars and his capital totals some $1,400,000,000, not to mention the fabled &ldquo;Mines of Golconda.

In 1940, the treasury of the newly independent Union government of India reported annual revenue of $1 billion. Under his rule, he patronised education, science and development. He also introduced electricity, railways, roads and airways. His collection of jewels alone was valued at approximately $500 million.

By 1990, over 400 people showed up as claimants to his massive wealth. The Indian Government finally annexed the state of Hyderabad in 1948 and the Nizam signed his wealth over to his grandson Prince Mukarram Jah. While all the wealth of the Nizam was being seized by the Indian government, the Nizam made a transfer of 1 million pounds in NatWest Bank in London in the name of his grandson, Mukarram Jah. The British government converted that huge sum of money into war bonds and eventually turned it into a fixed income deposit, forever. Mukarram Jah lives a life of ruins as he never received his inheritance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Richest Indian man\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/richest-indian-man5-1463057670.jpg\" alt=\"Richest Indian man\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/richest-indian-man5-1463057670.jpg\" />&copy; Wikimedia</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-500\" title=\"Richest Indian man\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/richest-indian-man6-1463057697.jpg\" alt=\"Richest Indian man\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/richest-indian-man6-1463057697.jpg\" />&copy; Wikimedia</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101370222,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">TIME magazine report dated Feb 22, 1937</a></p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/richest-indian-man980-1463057481_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[All You Need To Know About Narsingh Yadav Who Might Edge Out Sushil Kumar In Olympic Qualifying ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30607-all-you-need-to-know-about-narsingh-yadav-who-might-edge-out-sushil-kumar-in-olympic-qualifying.html]]></link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:16:52 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Anshul Gandhi</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Today]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30607-all-you-need-to-know-about-narsingh-yadav-who-might-edge-out-sushil-kumar-in-olympic-qualifying.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30607-all-you-need-to-know-about-narsingh-yadav-who-might-edge-out-sushil-kumar-in-olympic-qualifying.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/who-is-narsingh-yadav-wrestler-400x200-1463057573_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Narsingh Pancham Yadav is the man of the moment.

A lot of men avoid sporting tank tops and vests because of that ugly dark patch under their arms. A dirty armpit is the biggest turn off there can be in a man, honestly. So, read on as we tell you 12 simple ways you can keep your underarms fresh and clean.</p>\r\n<p>1. Grate a slice of potato and extract the juice. Apply it on your armpits and let it dry for 10 minutes. Rinse. Repeat this every day.</p>\r\n<p>2. Extract cucumber juice. Add some lemon squeeze and turmeric powder to it. Apply that paste. Wash after half an hour.</p>\r\n<p>3. Rub a slice of lemon on your armpits twice a day. Lemon makes the skin lighter and kills germs. But excessive use of lemon juice can also dry up your skin. So, do follow it up with a moisturizer every time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-To-Get-Cleaner-Underarms\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-to-get-cleaner-underarms-652x400-3-1463056471.jpg\" alt=\"How-To-Get-Cleaner-Underarms\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-to-get-cleaner-underarms-652x400-3-1463056471.jpg\" />&copy; Shutterstock</p>\r\n<p>4. Due to lack of personal hygiene, dead skin cells accumulate making the skin appear darker. Exfoliate it every day using a mix of brown sugar and virgin olive oil.</p>\r\n<p>5. You can also use pumice stone to remove the dead skin cells, but don&rsquo;t go too rough as the underarm skin can be sensitive to abrasions.</p>\r\n<p>6. Make a paste of milk, rose water and dried orange peel powder and leave the paste on for about 20 minutes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-To-Get-Cleaner-Underarms\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-to-get-cleaner-underarms-652x400-6-1463056506.jpg\" alt=\"How-To-Get-Cleaner-Underarms\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-to-get-cleaner-underarms-652x400-6-1463056506.jpg\" />&copy; Shutterstock</p>\r\n<p>7. You can also use a bleaching agent to make your armpit skin lighter in appearance by mixing baking soda with rose water.</p>\r\n<p>8. Apply coconut oil on your armpits before bathing. The Vitamin E will help lighten the skin.</p>\r\n<p>9. A thick paste of gram flour and yogurt also works wonders.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-To-Get-Cleaner-Underarms\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-to-get-cleaner-underarms-652x400-9-1463056544.jpg\" alt=\"How-To-Get-Cleaner-Underarms\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-to-get-cleaner-underarms-652x400-9-1463056544.jpg\" />&copy; Shutterstock</p>\r\n<p>10. Avoid using deodorants directly onto your underarms. It causes darkening of skin.</p>\r\n<p>11. Shaving or trimming doesn&rsquo;t remove underarm hair completely which makes them look darker than the rest of your body. If waxing hurts too much, use a hair removal cream after you&rsquo;ve shaved or trimmed your underarm hair.</p>\r\n<p>12. Wear the right kind of clothes.

Par asli Don toh bas ek hi hai.&rdquo; Although Farhan Akhtar tried his hand really well at the remake of the iconic movie Don (1978) starring Amitabh Bachhan, it was perhaps nowhere close to what AB senior had delivered for us. Amitabh&rsquo;s &lsquo;Don&rsquo; is not just a movie but is a legacy. It not only won several awards at the box office, but also managed to win everyone&rsquo;s hearts. Today as the movie completes 38 years, Amitabh Bachhan still remains the original Don in Bollywood.

Even if some of us do care about our skin, we hardly know the correct measures to care for it.</p>\r\n<p>We generally tend to take some kind of &ldquo;word of mouth&rdquo; advice and go ahead with applying that advice on our skin which can be really harmful and can back fire. Each skin type is different and there needs to specific expert attention given to it. An advice given to you by your friend doesn&rsquo;t necessarily go well with your skin. We suggest you stop believing in the myths you hear around and focus on the truth with these 8 common skincare tips.</p>\r\nMyth &ndash; Fairness Creams Will Make Your Skin Fairer\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true1-1463052764.jpg\" alt=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true1-1463052764.jpg\" />&copy; YouTube</p>\r\n<p>Truth &ndash; Seriously? Did you actually get trapped in this big marketing gimmick? We thought so! Not only fairness creams send a bad social message, they also do not make you any fairer. These creams just remove pigmentation and even out the discoloured skin. If you go by our advice, we reckon you to not worry about the colour of your skin and be just as confident with it. Whiter is not necessarily better.</p>\r\nMyth &ndash; Higher The SPF In A Sunscreen, Higher Is The Sun Protection\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true2-1463052807.jpg\" alt=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true2-1463052807.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>Truth &ndash; There are three types of UV rays &ndash; UVA, UVB and UVC. UVA is the most harmful penetrating your skin deeply causing a tan. UVB rays cause normal sunburns and UVC rays get absorbed by the atmosphere meaning they do not reach the ground. The SPF on a sunscreen means the amount of protection it provides from UVB rays and most sunscreens just cover UVB rays and not UVA. Broad spectrum on a sunscreen means that it provides protection from both UVA and UVB. We suggest you go for a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF of at least 15 with one of the following chemicals - mexoryl, oxybenzone or avobenzone.</p>\r\nMyth &ndash; You Don&rsquo;t Need Sunscreen On A Cloudy Day\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true3-1463052841.jpg\" alt=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true3-1463052841.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>Truth &ndash; The sun rays do reach the earth surface even on a cloudy day. Do not get this wrong and apply your sun screen as you would usually on a sunny day because you always want to be protected.</p>\r\nMyth &ndash; Drinking Water Will Hydrate Your Skin\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true4-1463052903.jpg\" alt=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true4-1463052903.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>Truth &ndash; You have heard it a zillion times that drinking a lot of water will keep your skin hydrated but it&rsquo;s not totally correct. Drinking water is generally very healthy for our body but its co-relation with skin is untrue. Our skin is hydrated either by naturally producing oils or with the help of moisturizers and skin lotions. Now you know what to do if you want to care for your dry skin.</p>\r\nMyth &ndash; You Don&rsquo;t Need To Moisturize Oil Skin Type\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-500\" title=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true5-1463052975.jpg\" alt=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true5-1463052975.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>Truth &ndash; If you have oily skin, you know what we exactly mean. Oily skin types, just like dry and combination, needs to be moisturized on a daily basis. If you tend to over wash or leave oily skin un-moisturized, they become too dry producing more sebum because of lack of moisture leading to breakouts in your skin.</p>\r\nMyth &ndash; Your Skin Is Less Irritable To Natural Remedies Than Chemical Ones\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true6-1463053034.jpg\" alt=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true6-1463053034.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>Truth &ndash; Sure natural ingredients have a lot of benefits attached to them but using them on your skin can be dangerous for people with sensitive skins. While chemicals are treated in the labs under expert supervision to deal with our skin, natural products, because they are directly taken from plants react differently to different skin types.</p>\r\nMyth &ndash; Drinking Milk Makes Your Skin White\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true7-1463053068.jpg\" alt=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true7-1463053068.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>Truth &ndash; While you have been told about this &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; since you were a kid and even now that drinking milk will make your skin white and smooth but this co-relation is not at all true. In fact, skin experts claim that humans shouldn&rsquo;t drink animal milk after two years of birth i.e. infancy. We wonder what we have been taught all this while.</p>\r\nMyth &ndash; Scrubbing Removes Blackheads\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true8-1463053096.jpg\" alt=\"Common Skincare Myths You Probably Thought Were True\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true8-1463053096.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>Truth &ndash; We usually become the experts ourselves and go on to give out advices like these which are absolutely untrue. Blackheads are rooted deep inside the pores of your skin which cannot be removed by scrubbing alone. We just tend to scrub out the outer layer of the blackhead which grows back again next to the blackhead you just removed. Next time, go to a skin expert to get your blackheads removed and not on your own.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/common-skincare-myths-you-probably-thought-were-true980-1463052733_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Voice Of West Indies Cricket Falls Quiet As Tony Cozier Passes Away ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/sports/cricket/30601-the-voice-of-west-indies-cricket-falls-quiet-as-tony-cozier-passes-away.html]]></link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:14:39 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sparsh Mudgal</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Cricket]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/sports/cricket/30601-the-voice-of-west-indies-cricket-falls-quiet-as-tony-cozier-passes-away.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/sports/cricket/30601-the-voice-of-west-indies-cricket-falls-quiet-as-tony-cozier-passes-away.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tony-cozier-passes-away-400x200-1463049983_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Once, there wasn&rsquo;t a single game in the Caribbean which was given the right nod without Tony Cozier&rsquo;s commentary being involved in it.

Five minutes later, she comes over, slaps you or scolds you and takes away your phone for not listening to her. And all you have to say in defense was that you didn&rsquo;t know she said something. Does this situation sound similar to you? &nbsp;Trust us guys, it is a common phenomenon and happens with us all the time.</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s hard is we blame ourselves for not listening and go on a guilt trip for screwing up. Well, don&rsquo;t blame yourselves or your phone for this phenomenon.</p>\r\n<p>A new study reveals that when you are busy with your smartphone or doing any other taxing visual task, you won&rsquo;t be able to hear what others are saying or any background sound. This research has been published in the Journal of Neurosciences and this hearing deficit is being called Inattentional Deafness http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/49/16046.abstract .</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Not-paying-attention-to-others-while-on-the-smartphone\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/not-paying-attention-to-others-while-on-the-smartphone-652x400-1-1463049476.jpg\" alt=\"Not-paying-attention-to-others-while-on-the-smartphone\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/not-paying-attention-to-others-while-on-the-smartphone-652x400-1-1463049476.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>So technically this might not be your fault if you couldn&rsquo;t hear what your mom asked you to get, or when you skipped your station because you were too engrossed in your book. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This study was approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee and more than 10 people participated in it. According to their experiment, when the participants were subjected to difficult visuals tasks, there was a reduction in brain&rsquo;s response to the background sound.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Not-paying-attention-to-others-while-on-the-smartphone\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/not-paying-attention-to-others-while-on-the-smartphone-652x400-2-1463049530.jpg\" alt=\"Not-paying-attention-to-others-while-on-the-smartphone\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/not-paying-attention-to-others-while-on-the-smartphone-652x400-2-1463049530.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes people might think you are ignoring them. In fact, if your friend doesn&rsquo;t listen to you while using his laptop, don&rsquo;t get him wrong. They might not even know what you are talking about.</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, the findings of this research also suggest that our vision and hearing skills share limited resources in the brain. In other words, our brain cannot do visual and hearing things at the same time. So when we are doing any visual tasks, our brain has to choose between processing information from our eyes or ears.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks brain, for screwing up our lives! But at least now we have a reason to sympathize with ourselves.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/not-paying-attention-to-others-while-on-the-smartphone-980x457-1463049570_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch This Brazilian Footballer Finish Off With A Samba Move In An U-14 Game ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/sports/football/30599-watch-this-brazilian-footballer-finish-off-with-a-samba-move-in-an-u-14-game.html]]></link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:57:24 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sparsh Mudgal</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Football]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/sports/football/30599-watch-this-brazilian-footballer-finish-off-with-a-samba-move-in-an-u-14-game.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/sports/football/30599-watch-this-brazilian-footballer-finish-off-with-a-samba-move-in-an-u-14-game.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/400-1463050695_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>The Brazil FA, known for being corrupt since ages, is missing out regularly on talents like this with maddening Samba skills, which only the Brazilians can develop. &nbsp;In India we have cricket, in Brazil they have football.</p>\r\n<p>The magnitude of passion for the game can be seen even in a U-14 game in Brazil.</p>\r\n<p>See it for yourself here:</p>\r\n<p><iframe style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSBSTheWorldGame%2Fvideos%2F10154044766707752%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s sad about such talents is that they either move away to some other country or their potential dries up before they can even establish a name for themselves.</p>\r\nSoccer Politics\r\n<p>Corruption in Brazil has been a pervasive social problem since a decade, the effect on Football clubs in Brazil is imminent and players often leave for other countries and play different leagues which offer much more money as compared to what they get in Brazil.</p>\r\n<p>The middle-men and sponsors break down the wages of the players, charge the clubs in excess and at the end, players are under-paid and constantly engulfed in the internal politics within the clubs.</p>\r\n<p>Players like Neymar Jr. started with Santos but what he earns at F.C Barcelona, the others in Brazil can only dream.

If the first half of the league reeled under the T20 hangover, the second half has managed to make news for the right reasons. (Let&rsquo;s hope it remains that way!)</p>\r\n<p>While some players have managed to continue their purple patch into the tournament (Virat Kohli, obviously), others have failed to live up to their billing. (No, not Sam Billings!) And then there have been the unfortunate few who have been irregulars in the team and one can&rsquo;t help but wonder why.</p>\r\n1. Irfan Pathan (Rising Pune Supergiants)\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-1-1463047872.jpg\" alt=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-1-1463047872.jpg\" />&copy; BCCL</p>\r\n<p>Long after the ninth edition of the IPL is done and dusted with, Irfan Pathan&rsquo;s presence on the field, or rather the lack of it will continue to remain a contentious issue. Despite having a bowling attack which threatens to leak runs by the dozen, especially in the death overs, Rising Pune Supergiants have been reluctant to give Pathan a longer rope in the tournament, giving him only one game out of the ten games the team has played so far.</p>\r\n<p>Strangely, the left-handed cricketer has played only one match under MS Dhoni&rsquo;s captaincy in the IPL as he was also picked to represent Chennai Super Kings in 2015 and failed to get a game then.</p>\r\n<p>A handy batsman down the order, the younger of the two Pathan brothers could have been an effective player for a franchise already struggling to get points against their name in the table.</p>\r\n2. Sreenath Aravind (Royal Challengers Bangalore)\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-2-1463047926.jpg\" alt=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-2-1463047926.jpg\" />&copy; BCCL</p>\r\n<p>Left arm seamer Sreenath Aravind has been warming the bench for RCB despite being impressive in the previous editions of the IPL. With RCB already struggling in the bowling department, Virat Kohli has missed a trick by keeping Aravind, who has a bowling average of 19.22 in 21 IPL games, out of the line-up.</p>\r\n<p>Aravind, the highest wicket taker for Bangalore in 2011, with 21 scalps in 13 outings, has played only two games this season. Despite being expensive in the two outings, Aravind&rsquo;s ability to bowl both pace and spin gives the captain the option of bowling the Karnataka cricketer in the middle as well as the death overs.</p>\r\n3. Corey Anderson (Mumbai Indians)\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-3-1463047981.jpg\" alt=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-3-1463047981.jpg\" />&copy; BCCL</p>\r\n<p>Earmarking his name in international cricket after smashing his way to a 36 ball hundred against West Indies, Corey Anderson was picked for Mumbai Indians in 2014 for a whopping Rs 4.5 crores. In the 16 IPL matches that he has played so far, the Kiwi averages 31.58 with the bat along with an excellent strike rate of 136.33.</p>\r\n<p>Anderson has not played a single game for MI this year with England&rsquo;s wicketkeeper Jos Buttler being preferred over him. However, with only 166 runs in 10 games, Buttler has failed to live up to expectations. With the left hander being an effective bowler in the middle overs, coach Ricky Ponting should give Anderson an opportunity in the remaining four games.</p>\r\n4. Karn Sharma (Sunrisers Hyderabad)\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-4-1463048035.jpg\" alt=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-4-1463048035.jpg\" />&copy; BCCL</p>\r\n<p>Boasting of probably the best fast bowling attack in the competition, Sunrisers Hyderabad sits pretty on second spot in the IPL standings after 10 games. With an explosive opening pair of David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan, the SRH have their bases covered, except for a spinner who can be effective on slower wickets like Eden Gardens. With not much bowling behind him, Yuvraj Singh is not expected to bowl his quota of 4 overs on a consistent basis. Deepak Hooda, who has been playing in place of Karn, has picked up only a solitary wicket in 9 games.</p>\r\n<p>Sharma&rsquo;s left arm Googly can bamboozle the wickets in the middle overs, which can further curtail the flow of runs. With wickets expected to get drier and slower as the tournament concludes, Karn can prove to be a vital cog for his team.</p>\r\n5. Chris Gayle (Royal Challengers Bangalore)\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-5-1463048097.jpg\" alt=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-5-1463048097.jpg\" />&copy; BCCL</p>\r\n<p>You cannot drop Chris Gayle from a T20 squad! Period. Even if he has not scored runs in a few outings!</p>\r\n<p>Having the ability to demolish the opposition on any day with a strike rate that sends shivers down the bowling attacks, <a href=\"http://www.mensxp.com/sports/cricket/30397-virat-kohli-posts-an-instagram-message-to-congratulate-gayle-on-becoming-a-father.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gayle</a> has been kept out of the playing eleven ever since he returned to India following the birth of his daughter. Giving him just 4 games for the RCB this season is nothing less than a crime on the part of Captain Virat Kohli. His replacement, Australian Travis Head, has been unable to set the stage on fire, with just 54 runs in 3 innings.</p>\r\n<p>Already sans a menacing bowling unit, it is imperative that RCB strengthens their batting and keeping the hard hitting Jamaican out of the mix is a move which has raised a few (erm, many!) eyebrows.</p>\r\n6. Manan Vohra (Kings XI Punjab)\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-6-1463048156.jpg\" alt=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-6-1463048156.jpg\" />&copy; BCCL</p>\r\n<p>In an already struggling batting line-up, the batsman who has been scoring runs on a consistent basis gets dropped! Strange, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>\r\n<p>Manan Vohra, with 161 runs in 7 innings, along with Murali Vijay and Shaun Marsh were the only bright sparks in an otherwise abysmal batting effort for bottom placed Kings XI Punjab. After Marsh was ruled out of the tournament, Vohra was surprisingly benched for the game against Gujarat Lions. With David Miller and Glenn Maxwell still to get into their dangerous groove, Vohra&rsquo;s stroke play can provide some respectability to Punjab&rsquo;s fortunes in their remaining four games.</p>\r\n7. Sarfaraz Khan (Royal Challengers Bangalore)\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-7-1463048197.jpg\" alt=\"players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-IPL\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-652x400-7-1463048197.jpg\" />&copy; BCCL</p>\r\n<p>This is yet another tactic by Kohli which fails to find its supporters. <a href=\"http://www.mensxp.com/sports/cricket/30316-ipl-2016-5-times-sarfaraz-khan-proved-that-he-is-a-talent-that-india-needs-in-t20s.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sarfaraz Khan</a>, who made waves after a quick fire 45 in his second IPL game in 2015, enhanced his reputation of being a fearless batsman in the slog overs with a knock of 35 not out in just 10 deliveries against SRH this year.</p>\r\n<p>Having the skill to scoop and reverse sweep Yorkers at will, Sarfaraz finds himself out of the eleven despite having a strike rate of 212.9. Reason? The captain finds Khan&rsquo;s replacement Sachin Baby a better fielder. Well!</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/players-who-should-be-made-to-play-in-ipl-980x457-1463048417_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shy Guy Gautam Gulati Is All Set To Give You Some Serious Goals As Ravi Shastri In Azhar ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/interviews/30596-shy-guy-gautam-gulati-is-all-set-to-give-you-some-serious-goals-as-ravi-shastri-in-azhar.html]]></link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:24:50 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dessidre Fleming</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Interviews]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/interviews/30596-shy-guy-gautam-gulati-is-all-set-to-give-you-some-serious-goals-as-ravi-shastri-in-azhar.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/interviews/30596-shy-guy-gautam-gulati-is-all-set-to-give-you-some-serious-goals-as-ravi-shastri-in-azhar.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/shy-guy-gautam-gulati-is-all-set-to-give-you-some-serious-goals-as-ravi-shastri-in-lsquo-azhar-rsquo-400-1463047143_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>You remember Gautam Gulati, who rose to fame with Bigg Boss 8?

Post the reality TV show, Gautam has become one of the most searched people on Google and has been seen in all the right places in Bollywood. &ldquo;When &lsquo;Azhar&rsquo; came to me, there was no looking back,&rdquo; he quips. &ldquo;Yes, my time is not mine anymore since I have to dedicate most of it to work and travelling and working, again. But, it&rsquo;s what I have signed up for and I wouldn&rsquo;t change it for the world.&rdquo; Except maybe his mother, who Gautam tells us is the typical Indian mother. &ldquo;Every time I visit home in Delhi and have to return to work, she gets sad,&rdquo; he reveals. &ldquo;Of course, she misses me, like every mother does.

If you are fat around the waist, have weak muscles and bones, then your t-levels are low and you should be doing something about it ASAP! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\nUnderstanding Testosterone\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-You-Should-Work-Out-To-Naturally-Boost-Your-Testosterone-Levels\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-you-should-work-out-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone-levels-652x400-1-1463046621.jpg\" alt=\"How-You-Should-Work-Out-To-Naturally-Boost-Your-Testosterone-Levels\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-you-should-work-out-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone-levels-652x400-1-1463046621.jpg\" />&copy; <a href=\"http://www.smarthormonebalance.com\" target=\"_blank\">smarthormonebalance</a></p>\r\n<p>Testosterone or T is not only about bulging muscles and impeccable athletic performance. Optimum T-Levels guarantee better sex drive, sharp memory and better attentiveness. In short, you&rsquo;ll feel better at every aspect of your life. On the other hand, dipping T-levels can wreak havoc on your health. Also, keep in mind that injecting high dosage of synthetic T (common athletic steroid) can leave you physically and mentally impaired for life. The body produces enough T to get you in the best shape of your life. All you have got to do is to train right.</p>\r\nTrain Right, Train Hard\r\n<p>The best natural T is produced by working out. No, running for hours or beating yourself to death on the elliptical won&rsquo;t cut it. You need to LIFT weights! Here&rsquo;s how:</p>\r\n1) Compound Movements With Heavy Weights\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-You-Should-Work-Out-To-Naturally-Boost-Your-Testosterone-Levels\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-you-should-work-out-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone-levels-652x400-2-1463046679.jpg\" alt=\"How-You-Should-Work-Out-To-Naturally-Boost-Your-Testosterone-Levels\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-you-should-work-out-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone-levels-652x400-2-1463046679.jpg\" />&copy; <a href=\"http://www.Crossfit.com\" target=\"_blank\">Crossfit</a></p>\r\n<p>Compound moves engage a lot of muscle groups at once and exert intense metabolic pressure on the body. In short, the best way to boost testosterone! Deadlifts, Clean and jerks, barbell thrusters, load carry and burpees are some of the best compound moves you can do. Caution: lift only as heavy as your body can.</p>\r\n2) Maximize The Number Of Reps\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-You-Should-Work-Out-To-Naturally-Boost-Your-Testosterone-Levels\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-you-should-work-out-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone-levels-652x400-3-1463046715.jpg\" alt=\"How-You-Should-Work-Out-To-Naturally-Boost-Your-Testosterone-Levels\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-you-should-work-out-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone-levels-652x400-3-1463046715.jpg\" />&copy;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.Crossfit.com\" target=\"_blank\">Crossfit</a></p>\r\n<p>After heavy load comes volume training. Do more number of repetitions per set. For example, five sets of five repetitions is okay but eight to ten repetitions would boost your T levels even more. But don&rsquo;t go overboard either. Keep the sets smaller and reps on the higher end. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n3) Keep The Intensity High\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-You-Should-Work-Out-To-Naturally-Boost-Your-Testosterone-Levels\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-you-should-work-out-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone-levels-652x400-4-1463046783.jpg\" alt=\"How-You-Should-Work-Out-To-Naturally-Boost-Your-Testosterone-Levels\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-you-should-work-out-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone-levels-652x400-4-1463046783.jpg\" />&copy; Facebook</p>\r\n<p>The higher the intensity the better the testosterone spikes. While you jack up the weight and the reps, keep in mind you are going at a considerably fast pace. Lift heavy with correct form and keep the rest intervals as short as possible. High intensity strains your body and pushes the muscle to grow. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-you-should-work-out-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone-levels-980x457-1463046904_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[This Is Why Sushil Kumar Deserves A Fair Trial To Qualify For Olympics ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30593-this-is-why-sushil-kumar-deserves-a-fair-trial-to-qualify-for-olympics.html]]></link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:08:37 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Anshul Gandhi</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Today]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30593-this-is-why-sushil-kumar-deserves-a-fair-trial-to-qualify-for-olympics.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30593-this-is-why-sushil-kumar-deserves-a-fair-trial-to-qualify-for-olympics.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/this-is-why-sushil-kumar-deserves-a-fair-trial-to-qualify-for-olympics400-1463046211_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>India&rsquo;s only two time Olympic champion <a href=\"http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/29045-indian-olympic-wrestler-sushil-kumar-starts-his-venture-to-help-athletes-in-need.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sushil Kumar</a> is a worried man nowadays. Not only does he have to worry about preparing for the Olympics and working on his fitness but also fight a solo battle for a fair trial to make it to the grand event in the first place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"This Is Why Sushil Kumar Deserves A Fair Trial To Qualify For Olympics\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/this-is-why-sushil-kumar-deserves-a-fair-trial-to-qualify-for-olympics1-1463046144.jpg\" alt=\"This Is Why Sushil Kumar Deserves A Fair Trial To Qualify For Olympics\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/this-is-why-sushil-kumar-deserves-a-fair-trial-to-qualify-for-olympics1-1463046144.jpg\" />&copy; BCCL</p>\r\n<p>Standing in his way to the Rio games is Narsingh Yadav. Yadav, who was once a disciple of Sushil, and was mentored by him in the 74Kg category, demands that because he earned a quota place in the 74Kg category, he is the rightful heir to represent India in Olympics and that a trial for this place is immoral and unfair. But in doing so, he is not only undermining the rules which say that the quota place earned by an athlete is not his, but the country&rsquo;s. And therefore, Sushil Kumar is right in demanding a fair trial so that the best wrestler in the category competes in the event.</p>\r\n<p>Sushil Kumar has had to move up his weight category because of the change in rules after the last Olympic Games where he participated in the 66Kg category. Kumar, also nursing an injury hasn&rsquo;t been a part of any major event since his Commonwealth Gold performance in Glasgow.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"This Is Why Sushil Kumar Deserves A Fair Trial To Qualify For Olympics\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/this-is-why-sushil-kumar-deserves-a-fair-trial-to-qualify-for-olympics2-1463046173.jpg\" alt=\"This Is Why Sushil Kumar Deserves A Fair Trial To Qualify For Olympics\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/this-is-why-sushil-kumar-deserves-a-fair-trial-to-qualify-for-olympics2-1463046173.jpg\" />&copy; Twitter</p>\r\n<p>But demanding a fair trial comes with its own set of problems. If the Wrestling Federation of India goes through with a decision in favor of Sushil Kumar, they will not only have to fight off litigation from Narsingh but also take care of the fact that other athletes will also demand a fair trial because the rule then applies for the whole group of six quota places that Indian wrestlers have won so far.</p>\r\n<p>The selection trials, however, will ensure that the best wrestler goes on to compete and that there&rsquo;s no doubt regarding his credentials in the weight category as well as international acclaim. But as of now it looks hazy because Sushil&rsquo;s name was not included in the probable list forwarded to the Indian Olympic Association.</p>\r\n<p>Whatever happens, Sushil will not go out without a fight and that&rsquo;s for certain. The Wrestling Federation Of India has some hard decisions to make even as they look to balance their views subtly in public domain. That Sushil deserves a fair trial is no rocket science but will it be at the cost of another thoroughly deserving wrestler, nobody knows.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/this-is-why-sushil-kumar-deserves-a-fair-trial-to-qualify-for-olympics980-1463046230_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[10 Ways To Know If Someone Is Lying To You ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30592-10-ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you.html]]></link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:29:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ankush Bahuguna</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Today]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30592-10-ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30592-10-ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you-400x200-1463045804_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Doesn&rsquo;t it feel oddly satisfying when you know someone&rsquo;s lying but you listen to their story anyway, just to see how far they&rsquo;d go? These 10 signs will help you look through anyone who&rsquo;s trying to take you for a ride!</p>\r\n<p>1. They give out too much information. They reveal details that are completely unnecessary and irrelevant to the main plot. It&rsquo;s probably their way of overcompensating for the lie.</p>\r\n<p>2. They parrot a set of phrases or words multiple times in the same conversation. Their dialogue seems rehearsed. They fear getting caught so they tend to fall back on the part they&rsquo;re the most confident about.</p>\r\n<p>3. They make ambiguous statements that don&rsquo;t really reveal anything. They don&rsquo;t answer your questions directly. They twist them around and beat around the bush and steer away from the main subject.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Ways-To-Know-If-Someone-Is-Lying-To-You\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you-652x400-3-1463045689.jpg\" alt=\"Ways-To-Know-If-Someone-Is-Lying-To-You\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you-652x400-3-1463045689.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>4. We involuntarily cover our mouth when we&rsquo;re lying, even if just for a second. So, if you find someone touching their face or placing their hand over their lips, there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;re bluffing.</p>\r\n<p>5. Look for their body language. A man who has nothing to fear about will be relaxed. Someone who is lying would probably sit with their arms crossed against their chest, as if trying to hide something.</p>\r\n<p>6. Shuffling feet is the most obvious one. It shows that the person is on the edge and the nervousness is building up.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Ways-To-Know-If-Someone-Is-Lying-To-You\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you-652x400-6-1463045738.jpg\" alt=\"Ways-To-Know-If-Someone-Is-Lying-To-You\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you-652x400-6-1463045738.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock/Getty Images</p>\r\n<p>7. It is said that someone who is lying would avoid eye contact at all means. Look for their gaze. Does it shift around too often? Are they blinking in a weird way? Are they trying to look away every time you look at them?</p>\r\n<p>8. If you&rsquo;re a good observer, you can almost always spot the nervousness on a liar&rsquo;s face. There&rsquo;s something odd. They smile weirdly, their lips quiver a lot, and their eyebrows twitch. If you&rsquo;ve known the person for long, it wouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to identify these signs.</p>\r\n<p>9. Notice how their body reacts when you ask them a tricky question. When a person is about to lie, they make an involuntary head jerk.</p>\r\n<p>10. Heavy breathing is another common sign. Look at their shoulders. If their breathing pattern changes, you&rsquo;ll see their shoulders rising and the tension in their voice will be much noticeable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Ways-To-Know-If-Someone-Is-Lying-To-You\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you-652x400-10-1463045766.jpg\" alt=\"Ways-To-Know-If-Someone-Is-Lying-To-You\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you-652x400-10-1463045766.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock/Getty Images</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/ways-to-know-if-someone-is-lying-to-you-980x457-1463045789_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[7 Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/fashion/style-trends/30591-7-tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham.html]]></link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:21:33 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Aksheev Puri</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Style Trends]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/fashion/style-trends/30591-7-tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/fashion/style-trends/30591-7-tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham400-1463045689_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>When we talk about style, a name that undoubtedly comes to everyone&rsquo;s mind is David Beckham.

Have A Command On Your Suit Game\r\n<p>Beckham wears some of the best looking suits out there but it doesn&rsquo;t mean they are out of your reach. When we say best looking suits, we mean the fit, design and colours and not necessarily branded.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-500\" title=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham1-1463045432.jpg\" alt=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham1-1463045432.jpg\" />&copy; Pinterest</p>\r\n2. Mix And Match Should Be Your Go-To Staple\r\n<p>For a style star like Beckham, there is no end to the number of clothes he can have in his wardrobe but he still prefers to mix and match his favourite pieces here and there. Even you can take 5-6 most essential wardrobe pieces, and mix and match them into different outfits just like Beckham.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham2-1463045496.jpg\" alt=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham2-1463045496.jpg\" />&copy; Pinterest</p>\r\n3. Make Basic And Minimalist Clothes Your &ldquo;Essentials&rdquo; Right Now\r\n<p>While Beckham is undoubtedly the most stylish man out there, basics rank on top of his clothing preferences. David Beckham is a minimalist when it comes to dressing up as he never wears fancy outfit combinations contrary to his most fashionable image. We recommend you to keep your outfits as basic but still elegant by wearing more of whites, blacks and greys.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham3-1463045538.jpg\" alt=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham3-1463045538.jpg\" />&copy; Pinterest</p>\r\n4. Jackets And Denims Bring Out The Manliness In You, Wear Them More Often\r\n<p>Beckham loves his jackets and denims so much so that he is seen wearing them repeatedly at many events pointing towards his favouritism to these two trendy pieces. We suggest you have at least one leather jacket and two-three denim shirts in your wardrobe for sure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham4-1463045561.jpg\" alt=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham4-1463045561.jpg\" />&copy; Pinterest</p>\r\n5. Let Your Shoes Do The Talking\r\n<p>Shoes form a major part of Beckham&rsquo;s style statement. Sometimes, more than his clothes, his shoes are the talking point amongst the fashion experts around the world. So, get your shoe game in place, so that you can master half of Beckham&rsquo;s style. Sneakers, Boots and Brogues should surely make the cut first in your shoe rack.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham5-1463045591.jpg\" alt=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham5-1463045591.jpg\" />&copy; Pinterest</p>\r\n6. Your Grooming Habits Should Be Top Notch\r\n<p>When we say grooming, we mean everything from your hairstyle to beard, and even your skin as well. Beckham has tried more than 10 different hairstyles in his career and each one has gone on to become a trendsetter. So if you want to have that command over style, we reckon you experiment with your hairstyle right away and the same goes for your beard too.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham6-1463045632.jpg\" alt=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham6-1463045632.jpg\" />&copy; Pinterest</p>\r\n7. Confidence And Attitude Over Everything\r\n<p>Last but definitely not the least! Confidence and attitude are two main reasons why Beckham can pull off any outfit that he wears. If you want to look your best in any given outfit, you have to follow what Beckham does. Be confident and wear outfits that make you feel good about yourself and can charm the world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham7-1463045656.jpg\" alt=\"Tips To Dress Up Like David Beckham\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/tips-to-dress-up-like-david-beckham7-1463045656.jpg\" />&copy; Pinterest</p>\r\n<p>Dressing up like your favourite star is nothing that you cannot do. You don&rsquo;t need to have expensive or a massive wardrobe full of clothes to look great. All you need is a set of basic essential clothes which you need to wear according to the latest trends.

Sitting in an audience of school kids, I had my first Indian Rock moment and it was like an epiphany! That&rsquo;s the word I would use to describe Parikrama&mdash;an epiphany that started 25 years ago.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Parikrama Marks Their 25th Year In Indian Music And Here&rsquo;s Why It&rsquo;s A Big Deal\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/parikrama-marks-their-25th-year-in-indian-music-and-here-rsquo-s-why-it-rsquo-s-a-big-deal1-1462975341.jpg\" alt=\"Parikrama Marks Their 25th Year In Indian Music And Here&rsquo;s Why It&rsquo;s A Big Deal\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/parikrama-marks-their-25th-year-in-indian-music-and-here-rsquo-s-why-it-rsquo-s-a-big-deal1-1462975341.jpg\" />&copy; Facebook</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a great journey,&rdquo; Subir Mallik, the organist of the group says as we sit down to reminisce about the b(r)and&rsquo;s evolution since its inception (Yes, they ARE a brand). Subir recounts the initial days of the band and how they started out over two decades ago. &ldquo;It all started when a bunch of like-minded people got together with an aim to create music,&rdquo; he tells me. &ldquo;Back then, no one was doing good English rock music in India and we wanted to give people something authentic and homegrown.&rdquo; Their first concert ever happened back in 1991 at the ever popular Father Agnel School event, titled Bandstand. Soon after, they became a favourite at college fests and concerts, and Parikrama spread across the country like a wildfire.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Parikrama Marks Their 25th Year In Indian Music And Here&rsquo;s Why It&rsquo;s A Big Deal\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/parikrama-marks-their-25th-year-in-indian-music-and-here-rsquo-s-why-it-rsquo-s-a-big-deal2-1462975363.jpg\" alt=\"Parikrama Marks Their 25th Year In Indian Music And Here&rsquo;s Why It&rsquo;s A Big Deal\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/parikrama-marks-their-25th-year-in-indian-music-and-here-rsquo-s-why-it-rsquo-s-a-big-deal2-1462975363.jpg\" />&copy; The Official Gig</p>\r\n<p>With all the increasing adoration and accolades that the band received, it would seem only obvious that the next thing in their agenda would be to release an album. But they didn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;At that time, no one really believed in the concept of CDs and cassettes, to be honest. And we wanted to give our audiences a complete experience, without making them have to buy our music in order to listen to it. Money was never the motive behind our music,&rdquo; Subir informs.</p>\r\n<p>Parikrama, as a whole, has never limited their music rights to any kind of privilege and have, therefore, made their music available for download to all their fans and every ardent music lover. But how does that work out for the band in a world where everybody wants to make money off everything they possibly can? &ldquo;For us, music was never a means to an end,&rdquo; Subir explains. &ldquo;When we are up there performing, we are doing it for the joy of the music. We&rsquo;re just a bunch of guys who love music and want to make the most of it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Parikrama Marks Their 25th Year In Indian Music And Here&rsquo;s Why It&rsquo;s A Big Deal\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/parikrama-marks-their-25th-year-in-indian-music-and-here-rsquo-s-why-it-rsquo-s-a-big-deal3-1462975386.jpg\" alt=\"Parikrama Marks Their 25th Year In Indian Music And Here&rsquo;s Why It&rsquo;s A Big Deal\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/parikrama-marks-their-25th-year-in-indian-music-and-here-rsquo-s-why-it-rsquo-s-a-big-deal3-1462975386.jpg\" />&copy; Myopusradio</p>\r\n<p>Parikrama composed their first song, titled Xerox, that came to be known as the &lsquo;face of Indian rock&rsquo; music. In 1995, the band released their first single, Till I&rsquo;m No One Again, along with Open Skies, as part of The Great Indian Rock, Part &ndash; 1. One year later, Parikrama came out with But It Rained, a song dedicated to the Kashmir Valley kidnappings that happened around the same time, which went on to be named as one of the band&rsquo;s biggest hits, ever. One of the major highlights from the band remains their opening act for the Iron Maiden concert in Bangalore, India where they wowed, not just a crowd of 40,000 people who even sang along when the band played &lsquo;But It Rained&rsquo;, but went on to impress Rod Smallwood, Iron Maiden&rsquo;s Manager with their performances. Subir recalls how the international iconic rock band later joined them in their green room to praise Parikrama&rsquo;s music. &ldquo;It was such a magical moment for us; to be in the presence of those guys,&rdquo; Subir says.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Parikrama Marks Their 25th Year In Indian Music And Here&rsquo;s Why It&rsquo;s A Big Deal\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/parikrama-marks-their-25th-year-in-indian-music-and-here-rsquo-s-why-it-rsquo-s-a-big-deal4-1462975411.jpg\" alt=\"Parikrama Marks Their 25th Year In Indian Music And Here&rsquo;s Why It&rsquo;s A Big Deal\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/parikrama-marks-their-25th-year-in-indian-music-and-here-rsquo-s-why-it-rsquo-s-a-big-deal4-1462975411.jpg\" />&copy; Hard Rock Cafe Mumbai</p>\r\n<p>Now, it&rsquo;s 2016 and the band is still as strong as ever. Older, yes. Experienced, yes. Evolved, in a way, yes. That&rsquo;s Parikrama. The band has stayed true to their originality that made them into the phenomenon any rock band would aspire to be. And it all happened out of a genuine love for music; not a thirst for fame, or fortune. Maybe that&rsquo;s a lesson for most modern musicians. Maybe too many artists have sold their souls to the devils of commercialism, just to make it big. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s more than that,&rdquo; Subir says. &ldquo;I think today, it has become important to look at music and artists as a lucrative profession. The industry has grown over time and we have new musicians, genres coming up every day. So why not?&rdquo; The band today collaborates with younger artists to produce newer and more original music at live shows. &ldquo;We love to team up with other artists and create new music. The point is to have fun on the stage and do what you love,&rdquo; Subir says.</p>\r\n<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what Parikrama has been doing for the past 25 years&mdash;what they love. To many, the band is old and repetitive. But, that is exactly why we need Parikrama around even after 25 years. We need to be reminded of the music of the old. We need to be reminded constantly of where we came from, where we are at and where we are headed.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s been 25 years since Parikrama came to be. 25 years down the line, Parikrama still is. 25 years from now, Parikrama will live on as the Indian rock legends we lived amongst; as the legends who created what we know now to be <a href=\"http://www.mensxp.com/culture/music/30017-meet-dhruv-visvanath-the-current-big-thing-on-the-indie-music-scene.html\" target=\"_blank\">Indie</a> rock.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Parikrama Marks Their 25th Year In Indian Music And Here&rsquo;s Why It&rsquo;s A Big Deal\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/parikrama-marks-their-25th-year-in-indian-music-and-here-rsquo-s-why-it-rsquo-s-a-big-deal5-1462975446.jpg\" alt=\"Parikrama Marks Their 25th Year In Indian Music And Here&rsquo;s Why It&rsquo;s A Big Deal\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/parikrama-marks-their-25th-year-in-indian-music-and-here-rsquo-s-why-it-rsquo-s-a-big-deal5-1462975446.jpg\" />&copy; Hard Rock Cafe Mumbai</p>\r\n<p>Congrats on turning 25, Parikrama.

Well, guess what! Sometimes you also need to pass your boss. If dealing with our bosses wasn&rsquo;t already tough, imagine if you end up in an awkward encounter with them. At times it can be funny but sometimes it can get so tricky that it can actually take a toll on your job.</p>\r\n<p>So here are 10 men sharing their funny and awkward encounters at work that are crazy AF.</p>\r\n<p>1. &ldquo;My boss caught me taking a print out of my updated resume along with an offer letter from a rival company&hellip;I was called and fired instantly.&rdquo; - Rohan, 25</p>\r\n<p>2. &ldquo;My boss thought I was watching a presentation; so he came and stood behind me&hellip;I was watching a movie.&rdquo; - Parth, 22</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy anim-gif imwidth-500\" title=\"Men-revealing-funny-and-awkward-encounters-with-boss\" data-gif_image=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/men-revealing-funny-and-awkward-encounters-with-boss-1-1462973934.gif\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/men-revealing-funny-and-awkward-encounters-with-boss-1-1462973934.gif\" alt=\"Men-revealing-funny-and-awkward-encounters-with-boss\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/men-revealing-funny-and-awkward-encounters-with-boss-1-1462973934.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p>3. &ldquo;I was at a friend&rsquo;s party and cursing my boss for being a pain in my ass. I turn around only to see my boss staring at me. But good thing that he was too drunk to remember any of it.&rdquo; - Kabir, 26</p>\r\n<p>4. &ldquo;I was so drunk and pissed with my job that I texted my best friend about what an asshole my boss is&hellip;I accidently texted it to my boss.&rdquo; - Sameer, 28</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy anim-gif imwidth-500\" title=\"Men-revealing-funny-and-awkward-encounters-with-boss\" data-gif_image=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/men-revealing-funny-and-awkward-encounters-with-boss-2-1462973984.gif\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/men-revealing-funny-and-awkward-encounters-with-boss-2-1462973984.gif\" alt=\"Men-revealing-funny-and-awkward-encounters-with-boss\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/men-revealing-funny-and-awkward-encounters-with-boss-2-1462973984.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p>5. &ldquo;I was in the bathroom making plans with my friends while I lied that I am ill so need to go home early.

I noticed everyone was laughing so when I looked at the screen, it was me dancing shirtless at the office party and singing at the top of my voice. I even did a naagin dance in front of my boss. I couldn&rsquo;t face anyone that day.&rdquo; - Rohit, 27</p>\r\n<p>8. &ldquo;It was my first day at work and I was already late so while taking the lift I quickly closed the lift door, ignoring the person who asked me to stop.

From an impressive star cast to a great story line, everything about the movie looks promising. While we await the release of the movie, we give you 8 reasons to look forward to &lsquo;Udta Punjab&rsquo;:</p>\r\n1. Shahid Kapoor And Kareena Kapoor Starring In A Movie Together\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-500\" title=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab1-1462973840.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab1-1462973840.jpg\" />&copy; Balaji Motion Pictures</p>\r\n<p>The mere announcement of the fact that both the ex lovers had signed a movie together had our excitements hit the roof! Even though the fans were disappointed to know that they don&rsquo;t actually share the screen space, looking at them together on the same screen after a hiatus of almost 8 years is making us go crazy. &nbsp;This one tops the list, you have to agree!</p>\r\n2. Shahid Kapoor As The Rock Star, &lsquo;Tommy Singh&rsquo;\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-500\" title=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab2-1462973865.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab2-1462973865.jpg\" />&copy; Balaji Motion Pictures</p>\r\n<p>Sasha is famous for going that extra length for any role that he takes up. &nbsp;His character of &lsquo;Tommy Singh&rsquo;, a rock star living amidst drugs, looks fantastic from the trailer of the movie. His chiselled look, his long locks, everything about his acting proves his dedication and makes us look forward to this talent house.</p>\r\n3. An Eccentric, Yet A Very Interesting Story Line\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab3-1462973892.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab3-1462973892.jpg\" />&copy; Balaji Motion Pictures</p>\r\n<p>The movie deals with the rising issue of drug abuse in the Indian state of Punjab. The trailer looks very promising and with a stellar star cast, this movie seems to have nailed the story line already.</p>\r\n4. Diljit Dosanjh&rsquo;s Bollywood Debut\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab4-1462973914.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab4-1462973914.jpg\" />&copy; Balaji Motion Pictures</p>\r\n<p>Since the story revolves around Punjab, it is only natural to cast the superstar from the Punjabi world, Diljit Dosanjh. Diljit has an established fan base all over the world and has already proved his mettle as a singer and performer. This movie might establish him as an actor also, who knows!</p>\r\n5. Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s Deglam Avatar\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab5-1462973938.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab5-1462973938.jpg\" />&copy; Balaji Motion Pictures</p>\r\n<p>Alia Bhatt is one star kid who has ended up shining like the sun. In a short span of time, she has managed to essay a myriad of roles, but this one is going to be different from all her previous outings. She plays the role of a Bihari hockey player, who comes to Punjab as a wage labourer. She is like wine, getting better with every movie.</p>\r\n6. Abhishek Chaubey As The Kickass Director\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab6-1462973963.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab6-1462973963.jpg\" />&copy; Balaji Motion Pictures</p>\r\n<p>Kudos to the guy who gave us movies like &lsquo;Ishqiya&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dedh Ishqiya&rsquo; and has even assisted Vishal Bhardwaj previously. He has pelted many hits in the form of an awesome scriptwriter as well. Apparently this is going to be a successful outing too.</p>\r\n7. The Variety In Songs\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab7-1462973988.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab7-1462973988.jpg\" />&copy; Balaji Motion Pictures</p>\r\n<p>While &lsquo;Chitta Ve&rsquo; was a foot thumping number, &lsquo;Ikk Kudi &lsquo; is a soulful track. With the star cast, direction and script being in place, the songs will obviously be great.</p>\r\n8. Kareena&rsquo;s Solemn Look\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab8-1462974018.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons to watch Udta Punjab\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab8-1462974018.jpg\" />&copy; Balaji Motion Pictures</p>\r\n<p>Kareena Kapoor is an amazing actress but lately we have only seen her sporting dewy, glamorous roles. Be it in &lsquo;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&rsquo;, or her last movie &lsquo;Ki and Ka&rsquo;, we have not had a chance to see the &lsquo;actress&rsquo; in her. Kareena is essaying the role of a doctor which is going to be a serious, and a grave performance; something which we are really looking forward to see.</p>\r\n<p>Here is the trailer of the movie, in case you missed it:</p>\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/EJylz_9KYf8\"></iframe>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-to-watch-udta-punjab980-1462973803_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[Irrfan Khan Will Stump You With His Acting In This Impressive Trailer Of Madaari ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/30586-irrfan-khan-will-stump-you-with-his-acting-in-this-impressive-trailer-of-madaari.html]]></link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 18:40:57 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Harshleen Anand</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Movie Reviews]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/30586-irrfan-khan-will-stump-you-with-his-acting-in-this-impressive-trailer-of-madaari.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/30586-irrfan-khan-will-stump-you-with-his-acting-in-this-impressive-trailer-of-madaari.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/trailer-of-the-movie-madaari-400x200-1462972470_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/j4s3JmLGLCA?showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen> </iframe></p><p>From the makers of &lsquo;Mumbai Meri Jaaan&rsquo; and &lsquo;Drishyam&rsquo; comes another stellar offering starring Irrfan Khan . &lsquo;Madaari&rsquo; is based on a real-life incident which led to loss of lives and numerous injuries. The trailer shows Irrfan Khan as a common man who lost his son, and kidnaps the Home minister&rsquo;s son as a sign of revenge.

One of these ignored strength workouts is the &lsquo;load carry&rsquo;. If you have hit a strength-training plateau, then load carry, if done the right way, can prove to be really effective. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know and how to program load carries in your training.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-Load-Carry-Can-help-You-Build-Strength\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-load-carry-can-help-you-build-strength-652x400-1-1462971297.jpg\" alt=\"How-Load-Carry-Can-help-You-Build-Strength\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-load-carry-can-help-you-build-strength-652x400-1-1462971297.jpg\" />&copy; crossfit</p>\r\nUnderstand Load Carries\r\n<p>Anatomically, the human body is meant for lifting and carrying weights. But blame it on our lifestyle that we make every choice so that we can actually avoid carrying weights. Load carry helps put on muscle, boost overall physical strength, and fire up metabolism. Most important, grip, arm and core strength can be highly optimized doing the carries. &nbsp;</p>\r\nBreaking Down The Types Of &lsquo;Carries&rsquo;\r\n<p>Pick up weights and move. Yes, it&rsquo;s that simple but here, let me break down the load carry into 5 most effective variations so you can have a clear understanding.</p>\r\n1) Farmer&rsquo;s Walk\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-Load-Carry-Can-help-You-Build-Strength\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-load-carry-can-help-you-build-strength-652x400-2-1462971343.jpg\" alt=\"How-Load-Carry-Can-help-You-Build-Strength\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-load-carry-can-help-you-build-strength-652x400-2-1462971343.jpg\" />&copy; roguefitness</p>\r\n<p>One of the most effective of all, Farmer&rsquo;s Walk puts your arm strength to test. Pick up 2 dumbbells each weighing half of your bodyweight and walk as far as you can. Repeat till the time your shoulders and arms give up.</p>\r\n2) Yoke Carry\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-Load-Carry-Can-help-You-Build-Strength\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-load-carry-can-help-you-build-strength-652x400-3-1462971399.jpg\" alt=\"How-Load-Carry-Can-help-You-Build-Strength\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-load-carry-can-help-you-build-strength-652x400-3-1462971399.jpg\" />&copy; boxmag</p>\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Yoke&rsquo; is an equipment that&rsquo;s especially made for &lsquo;load carry&rsquo;. Speaking of form, the yoke carry allows you to carry the most weight as your entire body is lifting the weight and not only the hands, back or shoulder. The entire body is put to work. If you don&rsquo;t have access to a Yoke, use a barbell across your back.</p>\r\n3) Over Head Weight Carry (Barbell/Dumbbell)\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"How-Load-Carry-Can-help-You-Build-Strength\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-load-carry-can-help-you-build-strength-652x400-4-1462971449.jpg\" alt=\"How-Load-Carry-Can-help-You-Build-Strength\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-load-carry-can-help-you-build-strength-652x400-4-1462971449.jpg\" />&copy; <a href=\"http://www.crossfit.com\" target=\"_blank\">crossfit</a></p>\r\n<p>Lift a barbell, as heavy as you can, over your head and walk.

The heavier the weight the more work your muscles would have to put in.</p>\r\n<p>2 To make it more challenging, try carrying different weights in both hands.</p>\r\n<p>3 Distance you walk must be increased every time you do &lsquo;carries&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>4 Try incorporating it as a finisher on the days you train your shoulders.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/how-load-carry-can-help-you-build-strength-980x457-1462971600_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[This Is How The United Players Reacted as West Ham Fans Attacked The Team Bus ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/sports/football/30584-this-is-how-the-united-players-reacted-as-west-ham-fans-attacked-the-team-bus.html]]></link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 18:15:01 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sparsh Mudgal</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Football]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/sports/football/30584-this-is-how-the-united-players-reacted-as-west-ham-fans-attacked-the-team-bus.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/sports/football/30584-this-is-how-the-united-players-reacted-as-west-ham-fans-attacked-the-team-bus.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/this-is-how-the-united-players-reacted-as-west-ham-fans-attacked-the-team-bus-400x200-1462970826_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Apart from being fiddled in the top 4 race and losing 3-2 yesterday night, the United players were suffering even before they reached Upton Park.

Both hurled insults at each other blowing the situation out of proportion.</p>\r\n<p>1. The social media war between the two kicked off when Azealia accused Zayn of copying some of her ideas for his new music video&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Like I Would.&rdquo;, saying it aesthetically resembled her Yung Rapunxel video.</p>\r\n<p>2. Zyan got back at her with the tweet &ldquo;My @s too good for you&rdquo; in response to which Azealia launched into an expletive-ridden racist and homophobic rant:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">My @'s too good for you</p>\r\n&mdash; zayn (@zaynmalik) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zaynmalik/status/730138662428532736\">May 10, 2016</a>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>She also took to Instagram to vent her anger against Zyan.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"><a style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFO6qsqn1by/\" target=\"_blank\">Damn Zayn be mood boarding the fuck of out me \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b3..

When it comes to health, some aspects are crystal clear but some facts are so tricky that you won&rsquo;t believe them to be true. Here we are talking about those weird health facts that actually make sense.</p>\r\nAvoid Antibacterial Soaps To Prevent Illness\r\n<p>Just because any soap reads antibacterial, can you completely rely on them to fight germs? The truth is, it might not necessarily protect you from illness, and nor would it prevent you from passing it on to others. According to a <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm378393.htm\" target=\"_blank\">study by FDA</a>, few ingredients of the soap might expose you to hormonal changes and health risks. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Health Facts That Seem Unbelievable But Actually Make Sense\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/health-facts-that-seem-unbelievable-but-actually-make-sense1-1462970222.jpg\" alt=\"Health Facts That Seem Unbelievable But Actually Make Sense\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/health-facts-that-seem-unbelievable-but-actually-make-sense1-1462970222.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\nDiet Soda Does Not Help You Lose Weight\r\n<p>Sorry to crush your hopes guys, but drinking diet soda is not really helping. Eating sugar helps our bodies register the sweetness and work on the calorie intake, but the artificial sweeteners might trick our bodies into eating more and eventually lead to weight gain.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Health Facts That Seem Unbelievable But Actually Make Sense\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/health-facts-that-seem-unbelievable-but-actually-make-sense2-1462970244.jpg\" alt=\"Health Facts That Seem Unbelievable But Actually Make Sense\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/health-facts-that-seem-unbelievable-but-actually-make-sense2-1462970244.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\nAvoid Energy Drinks When Tired\r\n<p>The common ingredients found in most energy drinks are Taurine and Caffeine. When both these ingredients come together, the former actually blunts the impact of the latter. In fact, some studies suggest that Taurine also activates some receptors that decrease mental alertness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-500\" title=\"Health Facts That Seem Unbelievable But Actually Make Sense\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/health-facts-that-seem-unbelievable-but-actually-make-sense3-1462970265.jpg\" alt=\"Health Facts That Seem Unbelievable But Actually Make Sense\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/health-facts-that-seem-unbelievable-but-actually-make-sense3-1462970265.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\nCoffee Can Help You Take A Better Nap\r\n<p>Confused? Well, our brain has a chemical compound named Adenosine that slows down brain&rsquo;s activity and makes us feel sleepy. We also know that caffeine restores alertness. So when you sip coffee prior to a 20-minute nap, the adenosine gets cleared naturally in our sleep and we wake up feeling refreshed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Health Facts That Seem Unbelievable But Actually Make Sense\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/health-facts-that-seem-unbelievable-but-actually-make-sense4-1462970290.jpg\" alt=\"Health Facts That Seem Unbelievable But Actually Make Sense\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/health-facts-that-seem-unbelievable-but-actually-make-sense4-1462970290.jpg\" />&copy; pixabay</p>\r\nClean Your Mustache And Beard Regularly To Avoid Allergies Or Sneezes\r\n<p>Just like your clothes and skin, your mustache and beard too come in contact with germs and dust.

Ever so often, there comes a bat-cap crazy fellow who literally manages to send shivers down our spine and then there are these adorable characters who make even Care Bears look like fat ugly pieces of sh*t!</p>\r\n<p>But the manner in which these actors make everything they do seem so realistic is almost creepy sometimes. The idea of living the life of a character in order to give an honest performance is only getting more popular by the day. But we don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be wrong in saying that some of these artists have taken their &lsquo;Method Acting&rsquo; a bit too far.</p>\r\n<p>It is rumoured that certain actors have spent time with \"Character inspirations\" for months; some have even rumoured to have kept themselves in isolation, inching closer to insanity. Also, it didn't seem like they simply got off by mimicking those people. Eerily enough, these actors seemed to lose a little bit of themselves and become their characters in real life. Take a look.&nbsp;</p>\r\n8. Kate Winslet &ndash; The Reader\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ANm4sqQUsG0\"></iframe>\r\n<p>Bearing in mind the fact that Kate won an Oscar for this role, it already gives us a fair idea of the kind of hard-work and labour she must have put in for this character. Also, we have to give the woman some credit; it really couldn&rsquo;t be a cakewalk to play the role of a former Nazi concentration camp guard. No wonder, the performance took a toll on her. She went ahead to say that it took her months of crying and escaping a car accident to get out of it. Haven&rsquo;t seen the movie yet? Maybe this snippet could give you an idea.&nbsp;</p>\r\n7. Adrian Broody &ndash; The Pianist\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/OL8Qs9hpimk\"></iframe>\r\n<p>For Roman Polanski&rsquo;s historical drama, Adrian Broody played the role of a Holocaust survivor. And to look as authentic as he could in the role, he decided to starve himself and slimmed his way down to 65 kgs. He believed that the genuine desperation that comes from starvation couldn&rsquo;t be faked.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He also broke up with this girlfriend and shut himself from any kind of contact with the outside world, to understand the mindset of a Jew who had lost everything at the hands of Nazi&rsquo;s. So, you might watch sequences of him crying manically in the movie; well that&rsquo;s as real as it gets. He has reportedly stated that for over a year, he lived in the fear of whether or not he&rsquo;d be able to let go of the character.</p>\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether it was all worth it or not, but Adrian remains the youngest actor to bag the Best Actor Oscar Award for this role.</p>\r\n6. Ed Harris &mdash; Pollock\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8lvUr5ZtSjM\"></iframe>\r\n<p>Ed Harris is the kind of guy who likes to take his job very seriously. Not because of the weightage it holds for the end product but for his personal satisfaction. So, no matter how big or small a character may seem, Ed always chose the &ldquo;Methodical&rdquo; way out. During the shoot of &lsquo;Pollock&rsquo;, which he also directed, Ed played the role of the famous artist, Jackson Pollock. To give full justice to the character, Ed put on 15 kilos and started smoking Camel Cigarettes (same brand as Pollock did). To absorb Pollock into his soul, he developed his personality, characteristics and mannerisms in real-life. He literally dressed, walked and talked like him, even off the sets. He built a whole new art studio in his house to practise Pollock&rsquo;s trademark Drip-style painting. Now that&rsquo;s what we call &ndash; dedication, or maybe not!</p>\r\n5. Nicolas Cage &ndash; Birdy\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/zq_dsV0R2uQ\"></iframe>\r\n<p>This actor just doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand the concept of low-key. Going eccentric over film roles has helped him bag the unofficial title of being the craziest actor in Hollywood. He feels that hints of nuttiness help develop the performance and the character and we can&rsquo;t disagree. If losing his sh*t meant brilliant performances such as the role of a Vietnamese veteran from &lsquo;Birdy&rsquo;, we actually think that being a flip could result in greatness. For this character he required several facial injuries, so Nicolas decided to get 4 of his teeth extracted; he also covered his face in bandages that his character wore on-screen for 5 weeks straight, off sets. This apparently resulted in a lot of people growing scared of him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n4. Jamie Dornan &ndash; The Fall\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/24IWqdtVuUU\"></iframe>\r\n<p>Before Jamie made women across the globe go weak in the knees by playing the lead role in &lsquo;The 50 Shades of Grey&rsquo;, he played the character of the &ldquo;Belfast strangler&rdquo; in the BBC series of &lsquo;The Fall&rsquo;. To understand the mindset of a serial killer, Jamie confessed pushing a woman off the bus and pursuing her for several blocks after.</p>\r\n3. Jared Leto &ndash; Suicide Squad\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4yGppTYnDw0\"></iframe>\r\n<p>Aren&rsquo;t we all a little excited about the &lsquo;Suicide Squad&rsquo; ever since its trailer was released? And a lot of this excitement and anticipation has been brewing within us for one particular reason alone &ndash; The Joker. Following Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger&rsquo;s legacy we have with us yet another Joker &ndash; Jared Leto. Big shoes to fill, right! We understand that he must be under tremendous pressure, but sending Magrot Robbie a dead rat and sending bullets to Will Smith, what&rsquo;s up with that? As if the gifts to his co-stars weren&rsquo;t enough, he also sent the rest of the cast the carcass of a pig. His behaviour even scared the director, David Ayer. He said that he was scared to approach Leto with whatever it was that was going on. Apparently, he even worked out a laugh that made the hair in the back of your neck stand up. Is it strange if we say that all this makes us just want to watch the film even more?</p>\r\n2. Johnny Depp &mdash; Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8m662obIvhY\"></iframe>\r\n<p>This one came to us as more of a surprise, because as brilliant as the actor is, he hasn&rsquo;t been famously known for being a method actor. But when he hit the screens portraying himself as the crazy Hinter Thompson, it was perfection. Johnny Depp started to live in Thompson&rsquo;s apartment where he smoked and slept next to barrels of gunpowder. Depp began recording all the conversations he had with Thompson and interrogated him about his life to get a clearer picture of the character he was to play. Depp even let Thompson shave his head, when he decided that the haircut given by the films hairstylist wasn&rsquo;t good enough. Besides all this, Depp did a bunch of drugs while he played the character. Yet after all this insanity, Depp says that he was &ldquo;very responsible&rdquo; and did justice to the role. According to us, justice sure was served but responsible; now that&rsquo;s questionable. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n1.Robert De Niro &ndash; Cape Fear\r\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FQqo-w1qvws\"></iframe>\r\n<p>&nbsp;To pull off the look of psychotic Max Cady, De Niro paid thousands of dollars to grind his teeth down. That&rsquo;s right! Grind his teeth. He got several vegetable dye tattoos made all over his body and he also spent a lot of his time studying and researching on sex offenders. He even left behind creepy messages as Cady on Scorsese&rsquo;s answering machine to freak him out.</p>\r\n<p>People might say that they are slaves to their art. But these guys lost a little bit of themselves to their characters.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/actors-who-almost-became-mad-while-playing-challenging-roles980-1462969514_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[This Zakir Khan Sketch On Small-Town-Boy-Meets-Big-City-Girl Is Incredibly Hilarious ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30579-this-zakir-khan-sketch-on-small-town-boy-meets-big-city-girl-is-incredibly-hilarious.html]]></link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 17:42:48 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>MensXP Team</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Today]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30579-this-zakir-khan-sketch-on-small-town-boy-meets-big-city-girl-is-incredibly-hilarious.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30579-this-zakir-khan-sketch-on-small-town-boy-meets-big-city-girl-is-incredibly-hilarious.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/this-zakir-khan-sketch-on-small-town-boy-meets-big-city-girl-is-incredibly-hilarious-400x200-1462968858_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/sIl8vsWrD8o?showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen> </iframe></p><p>Zakir Khan is undoubtedly one of the most amazing stand-up comedians to have come up in recent times and this sketch just goes on to prove why he is loved by audiences all over India.

We are in the process of finalizing that in the cricket advisory committee and also short listing the name of the coaches who are available for the interview. Once that process is completed we will be in a position to take a final call to select the coach.\" But it&rsquo;s been almost a year and nothing&rsquo;s come off it yet.</p>\r\n<p>A few names have been tossed around for some time now, including the Kiwi duo of Stephen Fleming and Daniel Vettori, former Australian captain Ricky Pointing and even India U-19 coach <a href=\"http://www.mensxp.com/sports/cricket/29714-rahul-dravid-puts-on-the-mentor-s-cap-for-delhi-daredevils-as-upton-is-appointed-head-coach.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rahul Dravid</a>. But even though some of these former players might actually be interested in the job (Stephen Fleming and Dravid), they too have some doubts regarding the hectic travel schedule and the humungous responsibility which comes along with the top-job in cricket.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Why-Appointing-A-Celebrity-Coach-For-Team-India-Is-A-Big-Headache-For-BCCI\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/why-appointing-a-celebrity-coach-for-team-india-is-a-big-headache-for-bcci-652x400-2-1462965662.jpg\" alt=\"Why-Appointing-A-Celebrity-Coach-For-Team-India-Is-A-Big-Headache-For-BCCI\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/why-appointing-a-celebrity-coach-for-team-india-is-a-big-headache-for-bcci-652x400-2-1462965662.jpg\" />&copy; BCCL</p>\r\n<p>One of the main reasons why BCCI is finding it difficult to get the perfect man for the job is because of different leagues that have come up in the past three-four years. With the advent of Caribbean Premier League, Big Bash, Ram Slam and recently PCL, former coaches and players are spoilt for choice without having to commit for a longer period of time. This in turn also makes them a little picky when taking on high-octane assignments which can make or break their careers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For the time being, it seems, BCCI will make do with Ravi Shastri because finalizing a candidate when the BCCI president has himself resigned is a big task. And in some time, he might just be the only candidate left standing because he&rsquo;s not doing too bad a job of coaching team India, right?</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/why-appointing-a-celebrity-coach-for-team-india-is-a-big-headache-for-bcci-980x457-1462965698_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[18 Truths About People You Learn When You Grow Up ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30575-18-truths-about-people-you-learn-when-you-grow-up.html]]></link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 16:21:03 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ankush Bahuguna</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Today]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30575-18-truths-about-people-you-learn-when-you-grow-up.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/30575-18-truths-about-people-you-learn-when-you-grow-up.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-400x200-1462964224_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Growing up, you often realize most of those childhood learnings didn&rsquo;t mean anything. People are nothing like they seem to be. Life would be so much easier if only we could accept these truths.</p>\r\n<p>1. You may think life is particularly difficult for you. But the truth is everyone has their own struggles. We all have our own share of deep sorrows hidden somewhere safe. You may not see them, they may not talk about it from the rooftops, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ve had everything easy.</p>\r\n<p>2. You can never please everyone. No matter what you do, there will be people disapproving of your choices, despising you for your guts. And those are the ones you should ignore first.</p>\r\n<p>3. There are some people you will instantly connect with. You&rsquo;ll share the same joke and everything will just fit, no efforts required. And there will be those you just cannot get along with. Something would always be amiss. You&rsquo;ll probably never understand what and why.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-3-1462964016.jpg\" alt=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-3-1462964016.jpg\" />&copy; Unsplash</p>\r\n<p>4. People will judge you without knowing you. And you will do it to other people too, sometimes even with the best of intentions. Get over it. Nobody really knows anyone inside out.</p>\r\n<p>5. People pull each other down because sometimes that&rsquo;s the only way they can rise up.</p>\r\n<p>6. Nobody really fits into &lsquo;conventions&rsquo;, if you think of it. Those &lsquo;people&rsquo; we refuse to identify with actually don&rsquo;t exist. Everybody&rsquo;s constantly trying to break some stereotype or the other. Everybody&rsquo;s trying to break out of their shell and accept who they truly are.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-6-1462964065.jpg\" alt=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-6-1462964065.jpg\" />&copy; Unsplash</p>\r\n<p>7. People will be selfish no matter how good you&rsquo;ve been to them. They may not even be around to justify it.</p>\r\n<p>8. And you will break people&rsquo;s trust too, sometimes, in ways you wouldn&rsquo;t even know.</p>\r\n<p>9. People are a result of their experiences, a consequence of everything they&rsquo;ve seen and gone through. Everyone&rsquo;s the way they are for a reason. To really get to know them, you&rsquo;ve to listen to their story.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-9-1462964109.jpg\" alt=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-9-1462964109.jpg\" />&copy; Unsplash</p>\r\n<p>10. Loving people for who they are is the most difficult thing in the world. It&rsquo;s easier said than done. Everyone has their own share of flaws, flaws that may sometimes overpower them in entirety.</p>\r\n<p>11. Some people can just look through you, break all walls you&rsquo;ve built around yourself in just a moment, and reach the innermost corner of your soul. No matter how much you may pretend to be someone else, they&rsquo;ll find a way in.</p>\r\n<p>12. And sometimes, that&rsquo;s the reason why you&rsquo;d throw them out of your life the first. Because it may feel uncomfortable to share that little secret with someone you barely know.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-12-1462964138.jpg\" alt=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-12-1462964138.jpg\" />&copy; Unsplash</p>\r\n<p>13. Everyone&rsquo;s insecure in their own way. There&rsquo;s something all of us yearn for, there&rsquo;s something all of us are hiding from the world, something we all wanted but never got. And it&rsquo;s comforting to know we&rsquo;re all actually swimming in the same waters, it&rsquo;s not just you.</p>\r\n<p>14. People change. And not always for the good. You just gotta learn to live with it, or walk away.</p>\r\n<p>15. Most people don&rsquo;t know what they really believe in. They do what everybody&rsquo;s doing because it&rsquo;s convenient. It&rsquo;s comfortable and safe to be a part of the herd. They don&rsquo;t question their own beliefs. And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re the happiest!</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-15-1462964163.jpg\" alt=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-15-1462964163.jpg\" />&copy; Unsplash</p>\r\n<p>16. Don&rsquo;t go by what people say. You may take people&rsquo;s appreciation or criticism to your heart often, but you must know that most of them don&rsquo;t even mean what they say.</p>\r\n<p>17. We often chase the people we think are &lsquo;perfect for us&rsquo; but they&rsquo;re almost always different from the ones that are right for us.</p>\r\n<p>18. Each one of us is wearing a fa&ccedil;ade. Nobody is really like they appear to be. We&rsquo;re all just waiting for someone we can blindly trust, someone who&rsquo;d love us despite all our flaws.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-18-1462964189.jpg\" alt=\"Truths-About-People-You-Should-Know\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-652x400-18-1462964189.jpg\" />&copy; Unsplash</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/truths-about-people-you-should-know-980x457-1462964210_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ikk Kudi From Udta Punjab Is A Profound Number Which You Cannot Miss ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/gossip/30574-ikk-kudi-from-udta-punjab-is-a-profound-number-which-you-cannot-miss.html]]></link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 16:14:03 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Harshleen Anand</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Gossip]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/gossip/30574-ikk-kudi-from-udta-punjab-is-a-profound-number-which-you-cannot-miss.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/gossip/30574-ikk-kudi-from-udta-punjab-is-a-profound-number-which-you-cannot-miss.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/ikk-kudi-second-song-from-udta-punjab400-1462963647_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbX_nlzv7uU?showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen> </iframe></p><p>After a thrilling rockstar number titled &lsquo;Chitta Ve&rsquo; made waves, the makers of &lsquo;Udta Punjab&rsquo; launched the second song which is based on Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s character.

But sometimes it becomes difficult to maintain the healthy eating policy in office. The moment the clock strikes 4, we start getting hunger pangs and resort to the junk food available in the office cafeteria. Moreover, there can be too many tempting options available in office, but eating high calorie snacks and sugary drinks will make you feel sleepy and take your energy levels lower.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, for all you guys who are into fitness, trust us eating the same kind of fruits everyday is very boring, and making extra meals for office early in the morning when you&rsquo;re already rushing is out of question. So here&rsquo;s the deal: make a smart choice with these super easy snacks for office that don&rsquo;t even take much time.</p>\r\n1. Almonds And Peanuts\r\n<p>A handful of almonds or peanuts will not only keep you full but also provide the daily dose of protein you need. The only effort you need to make is pack it in an air-tight container. To make them more delicious you can roast them and sprinkle some salt and pepper on it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk1-1462961675.jpg\" alt=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk1-1462961675.jpg\" />&copy; wikimedia</p>\r\n2. Sprouts\r\n<p>Sprouts are low in calories, high in fibre and protein and an excellent choice to munch on in between work. If your taste buds are always on the lookout for something chatpata, make a sprout salad with chopped onions, cucumber, tomatoes and green chillies. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk2-1462961706.jpg\" alt=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk2-1462961706.jpg\" />&copy; wikimedia</p>\r\n3. Puffed Rice Or Rice Flakes\r\n<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t like Bhel Puri or any other chaat made with puffed rice. If you are not a pro with bhel puri, just toss in some cucumber, tomatoes, roasted peanuts, green chillies, salt and you are good to go. Poha is another easy thing to make and if not that, then just get a packet of diet chidwa.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk3-1462961728.jpg\" alt=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk3-1462961728.jpg\" />&copy; wikimedia</p>\r\n4. Oats\r\n<p>Oats are really easy to make and we are not talking about those ready to eat oatmeal that are full of preservatives. All you need to do is cook oats in water or skimmed milk and it takes even less than 10 minutes to make it. Show off your culinary skills guys! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk4-1462961759.jpg\" alt=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk4-1462961759.jpg\" />&copy; pixabay</p>\r\n5. Boiled Eggs\r\n<p>Boiled eggs are an excellent source of protein and possibly the first thing our gym trainer asks us to include in our diet. Boil extra eggs so that you can have some in the morning and leave some for the later part of the day. Though be a little conscious about the smell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk5-1462961785.jpg\" alt=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk5-1462961785.jpg\" />&copy; flickr</p>\r\n6. Fruits\r\n<p>When we said that eating fruits everyday gets boring, we did not intend on eliminating them totally. You can change the fruits daily. For instance, frozen bananas on one day and maybe fruit cream on alternate days. &nbsp;Even apples and peanut butter make a great combination.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk6-1462961819.jpg\" alt=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk6-1462961819.jpg\" />&copy; Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images</p>\r\n7. Club Sandwiches\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t expect you to make fancy grilled sandwiches. Just toast your bread, add some low fat butter or low fat cream, sliced cucumber and tomatoes and you&rsquo;re done. If you have time, make some fresh orange or watermelon juice. You will not just save big bucks but will cut down on calories too.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk7-1462961842.jpg\" alt=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk7-1462961842.jpg\" />&copy; public domain pictures</p>\r\n8. Yogurt And Boiled Vegetables\r\n<p>Yogurt is great for our digestive system and is a good source of probiotics. To make your snack more delicious and nutritious, you can boil your favourite vegetables and mix them with an yogurt dressing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk8-1462961865.jpg\" alt=\"Super Easy Healthy Snacks That You Can Eat At Your Office Desk\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk8-1462961865.jpg\" />&copy; wikimedia</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/super-easy-healthy-snacks-that-you-can-eat-at-your-office-desk980-1462961641_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[This Bodybuilder Looks Exactly Like Arnold Schwarzenegger And This Resemblance Is Breaking The Internet ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/health/body-building/30572-this-bodybuilder-looks-exactly-like-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-this-resemblance-is-breaking-the-internet.html]]></link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 15:15:25 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Shantanu Prasher</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Body Building]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/health/body-building/30572-this-bodybuilder-looks-exactly-like-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-this-resemblance-is-breaking-the-internet.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/health/body-building/30572-this-bodybuilder-looks-exactly-like-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-this-resemblance-is-breaking-the-internet.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/guy-resembling-arnold-schwarzenegger400-1462960068_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>The bodybuilding world will never see the second coming of a physique like that of Arnold Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s.

Following the firm footsteps of players like Mark Hughes, Thierry Henry, Alan Shearer, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robin Van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Gareth Bale, Riyad Mahrez found sublime form throughout the season scoring 25 goals and 29 assists. He, along with Jamie Vardy, played the pivotal role in securing the Premier League with two games to spare and gave a new dimension to his career.</p>\r\n<p>Here is the delight of the season, the Algerian maestro with the trophy:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">A day i Will Never Forget .. <a href=\"https://t.co/FbQlM8UO9z\">pic.twitter.com/FbQlM8UO9z</a></p>\r\n&mdash; Riyad Mahrez (@Mahrez22) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mahrez22/status/729650665983770625\">May 9, 2016</a>\r\nFrom Here To There, In No Time\r\n<p>Mahrez was born to a French mother in France and an Algerian/Moroccan father who like Riyad was a footballer. The sudden demise of his father when he was aged 15 made him follow his father&rsquo;s footsteps of becoming a professional footballer someday.</p>\r\n<p>He started his career in France with Quimper Kerfeunteun FC in 2009 to 2010, followed by a stint at Le Havre for 2 years where he scored 24 goals for the French side. Le Havre was relegated the following season but Riyad Mahrez continued to be a part in their Ligue 2 campaign hardly gathering 6 goals in 60 appearances.&nbsp;</p>\r\nThe Lucky Break\r\n<p>While playing for Le Havre, the Leicester City scout Steve Walsh was monitoring Riyad&rsquo;s teammate Ryan Mendes but was instead impressed by the Algerian. In January 2014, Riyad Mahrez signed a 3 and half year contract with Leicester City who were struggling in the second-tier Championship.</p>\r\n<p>In the next few months, Mahrez had 4 substitute appearances in which he scored his first goal for Leicester and then scored an important 82nd minute equalizer against local rivals Nottingham Forest. Leicester eventually won the championship and regained their place in the English Premier League after 10 years.</p>\r\nThe EPL Debut: Mahrez Has Arrived On The Main Stage\r\n<p>Riyad Mahrez made his EPL debut on 24th August, 2014 and scored his first goal in the English Premier League on 4th October, 2014 in a 2-2 draw against Burnley. He played a key role when Leicester won 7 consecutive games to keep them alive in the league and avoid relegation.&nbsp;</p>\r\nSeason 2015-2016\r\n<p>By luck or by fluke, Riyad Mahrez was ready for another season and signed a four-year contract in 2015 just before the season started. He scored twice in the season opener against Sunderland where Leicester won 4-2.</p>\r\n<p>Wes Morgan, Leicester&rsquo;s captain described Mahrez as &lsquo;the team&rsquo;s match winner&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>By November, Riyad Mahrez scored 7 goals in 10 games and then pumped in a hat-trick against Swansea City scoring all the 3 goals in a 3-0 win.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"The-story-of-Algerian-football-player-Riyad-Mahrez\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/the-story-of-algerian-football-player-riyad-mahrez-652x400-2-1462960242.jpg\" alt=\"The-story-of-Algerian-football-player-Riyad-Mahrez\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/the-story-of-algerian-football-player-riyad-mahrez-652x400-2-1462960242.jpg\" />&copy; Reuters</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"The-story-of-Algerian-football-player-Riyad-Mahrez\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/the-story-of-algerian-football-player-riyad-mahrez-652x400-3-1462960306.jpg\" alt=\"The-story-of-Algerian-football-player-Riyad-Mahrez\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/the-story-of-algerian-football-player-riyad-mahrez-652x400-3-1462960306.jpg\" />&copy; Reuters</p>\r\n<p>The hat-trick helped Leicester City move at the top of the table, a scenario that still hasn&rsquo;t changed, with just a game week more to go for the league to end. Claudio Ranieri described Mahrez and Vardy as &ldquo;priceless&rdquo; before the January transfer window and that was not an understatement considering the low price for which both Vardy and Mahrez were acquired.</p>\r\n<p>Such is the case that Riyad Mahrez&rsquo;s transfer value increased from 4.5 million pounds to 35.1 million pounds in January, 2016.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"The-story-of-Algerian-football-player-Riyad-Mahrez\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/the-story-of-algerian-football-player-riyad-mahrez-652x400-4-1462960333.jpg\" alt=\"The-story-of-Algerian-football-player-Riyad-Mahrez\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/the-story-of-algerian-football-player-riyad-mahrez-652x400-4-1462960333.jpg\" />&copy; Reuters</p>\r\n<p>The family which earlier hesitated on Mahrez&rsquo;s decision of coming to England is now a happy unit post Leicester&rsquo;s triumph.

The defeat to Atletico Madrid and a draw against Malaga was enough for the fans to create a &lsquo;storm&rsquo; of hostility in front of their own team at the Bernabeu. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Reasons Why Real Madrid Is A Brilliant Team With The Worst Fans\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-why-real-madrid-is-a-brilliant-team-with-the-worst-fans2-1462959460.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons Why Real Madrid Is A Brilliant Team With The Worst Fans\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-why-real-madrid-is-a-brilliant-team-with-the-worst-fans2-1462959460.jpg\" />&copy; Reuters</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Reasons Why Real Madrid Is A Brilliant Team With The Worst Fans\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-why-real-madrid-is-a-brilliant-team-with-the-worst-fans2a-1462959491.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons Why Real Madrid Is A Brilliant Team With The Worst Fans\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/reasons-why-real-madrid-is-a-brilliant-team-with-the-worst-fans2a-1462959491.jpg\" />&copy; Reuters</p>\r\n<p>2. How do you give superior treatment to Alvaro Arbeloa and not do the same for a legend like &lsquo;Iker Casillas&rsquo;? &nbsp;Recently, the fans gave a rousing farewell to Arbeloa and even raised a big banner of his jersey in the crowd to say goodbyes to the former Liverpool man.

You&rsquo;ll notice the bartender reach for a pestle-like wooden crusher used to get the juice or essential oils out of the fruit or herb in your drink. It just helps to know this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Examples of such drinks: A Vodka Mojito, Spritzers, Brazilian Sangria, Black and Blue Caipiroska, Caipirinha&nbsp;</p>\r\n4.

Virgin means the same as ordering a mocktail. But, here&rsquo;s the thing about mocktails&mdash;it&rsquo;s for teenagers. You use the word virgin. For instance, you want a Virgin Mojito; or a Virgin Bloody Mary, or a Virgin Martini. It means sans the alcohol. Get it?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Examples of such drinks: All mocktails are virgin drinks&mdash;Mojitos, Martinis, Bloody Mary&nbsp;</p>\r\n5.

For instance, a Dirty Martini is all about adding bar olive juice so that the clarity is diluted and it tastes comparatively salty. Similarly, a Dirty Mojito is one in which you add gold rum, instead of white rum; thereby diluting the transparency of the drink.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Examples of such drinks: Dirty Martini, Dirty Shirley, Dirty Mojito, Dirty Vodka Martini</p>\r\n6.

This means, you don&rsquo;t add ice, or water, or any other mixture to this drink. Such drinks are usually meant to be sipped on slowly, to last you through most parts of your evening.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Examples of such drinks: Vodka, Whisky, Bourbon, Gin</p>\r\n7.

Here&rsquo;s what it means. Any drink served &lsquo;On the rocks&rsquo; is poured out for you in a lowball glass, over a cluster of ice cubes which is from where the term gets its name.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Examples of such drinks: Scotch, Prosecco, Whiskey, Vodka</p>\r\n8.

Didn&rsquo;t understand? This kind of a drink is usually shaken, or stirred up with ice, after which the ice is strained and the drink is served to you chilled. Suppose you go for a margarita, to this ice is added, shaken, or stirred&mdash;according to your preference&mdash;then, it is strained and served to you. You can try this with most cocktail options.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Examples of such drinks: Martini, Margarita&nbsp;</p>\r\n9.

We usually assume the fruits are added as a decoration piece on the drink. However, the fruit adds a hint of flavour to whatever the drink is; and in most cases, the flavour is a contrast to the notes in the drink so it balances out the taste.

But considering that this was uploaded and shared by the same Rocky who allegedly killed a teenager with his Italian 0.45 caliber pistol gives a sneak-peek into the violent mind of a VIP family&rsquo;s only son.</p>\r\n<p>In the Hindi-heartland, on numerous occasions, people have been arrested on harmless status updates and therefore, it is nearly impossible to believe that a guy brandishing arms enough to incite violence in multiple districts of a state like Bihar never caught the attention of the authorities.</p>\r\n<p>\"The accused man's family is very influential.

Common people like us are afraid that even after a tragic incident like this, will justice be delivered? Will an impartial probe conclude in time or will the family members have to wait in line like many others before them?</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that VIPs feel a sense of entitlement to act out in such scenarios. &lsquo;How could he overtake me just like that, I&rsquo;ll teach him a lesson&rsquo;, &lsquo;Did he just stare at me while overtaking, he&rsquo;ll regret it now&rsquo;. This mindset of &lsquo;I have a strong back&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mere Baap Ko Jaanta Hai&rsquo; is the reason why people think that political power eclipses everything. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the same charade of allegations and counter-allegations has started, as it does after every high-profile case with the accused giving multiple conflicting statements. That nobody is really talking about the Bahubalis&rsquo; dangerous transformation from Jungle-raj to VIP-raj in Bihar shows how we are failing to address the root-cause of these tragic incidents.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/rocky-yadav-killing-aditya-sachdeva-in-bihar-980x457-1462886286_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is Raman Raghav 2.0 Anurag Kashyaps Best Movie Till Date?

We all have our set of notions attached with it and want to grab that dream job too. Be it friends, family or mentors, one question they will surely ask you is &ldquo;What is your dream job?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But what is a dream job? Is it one that pays you exceptionally well? Is it a job where you get creative freedom and do what you are passionate about? There are so many expectations related to a dream job that sometimes we just sit and think if we are doing anything productive in our career.</p>\r\n<p>While you guys fantasize about dream jobs, let us bust some myths for you to give you a reality check. &nbsp;</p>\r\nMyth: My Passion Will Pay For My Bills\r\n<p>Reality: Sorry to break your heart, but passion does not always pay well. Few months in the job and you might already be struggling to choose between luxury and necessity. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t do what you love.

With the emergence of T20, the cricketing notions have completely transformed, with unexpectedly high scoring rates and stroke play.</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Comparing-Sachin-Tendulkar-and-Virat-Kohli\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/comparing-sachin-tendulkar-and-virat-kohli-652x400-2-1462882283.jpg\" alt=\"Comparing-Sachin-Tendulkar-and-Virat-Kohli\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/comparing-sachin-tendulkar-and-virat-kohli-652x400-2-1462882283.jpg\" />&copy; BCCL</p>\r\n<p>Kohli mostly sticks to the manual and he is consistent without having to take too many risks, avoiding flamboyant air-borne strokes. Watching him sweep the bat off the grounds and playing those amazing cover drives does remind one of Sachin but that is where the comparison must end. This is Kohli&rsquo;s format as much as Test Cricket was Sachin&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n<p>Sachin was more of a purist who considered batting an art and loved to express himself on the field with a plethora of shots in his armor. Therefore, comparing both Kohli and Sachin&rsquo;s art-form is like comparing chalk and cheese which doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, does it?</p>\r\n<p>Kohli, in the end, will definitely break some of the records which Sachin made. It&rsquo;s certain and in time it will happen. And till then it would be wise if we can just maintain some level of sanity and not feed these stats as some sort of biblical truth of what a past-master was or what a current young-ace is.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content url=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/comparing-sachin-tendulkar-and-virat-kohli-980x457-1462882318_980x457.jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bollywood Legend Shashi Kapoors Biography Has Been Released andamp Its A Treat For Every Cinema Lover ]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.mensxp.com/culture/arts/30560-bollywood-legend-shashi-kapoor-s-biography-has-been-released-it-s-a-treat-for-every-cinema-lover.html]]></link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 16:49:33 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dessidre Fleming</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Arts]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.mensxp.com/culture/arts/30560-bollywood-legend-shashi-kapoor-s-biography-has-been-released-it-s-a-treat-for-every-cinema-lover.html</guid><description><![CDATA[<a href = \"http://www.mensxp.com/culture/arts/30560-bollywood-legend-shashi-kapoor-s-biography-has-been-released-it-s-a-treat-for-every-cinema-lover.html\"><img src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/bollywod-legend-shashi-kapoors-biography-released-400x200-1462879395_400x200.jpg\" /></a><p></p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Remember that epic dialogue from the iconic yesteryear&rsquo;s Bollywood movie &lsquo;Deewar&rsquo;, where Shashi Kapoor retorts to Amitabh Bachchan in what went on to become one of the most famous dialogues in the history of Indian cinema?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"articleimg\"><img id=\"ed-img\" class=\"art-lazy imwidth-full\" title=\"Bollywod-Legend-Shashi-Kapoors-Biography-Released\" src=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/bollywod-legend-shashi-kapoors-biography-released-652x400-1-1462879244.jpg\" alt=\"Bollywod-Legend-Shashi-Kapoors-Biography-Released\" data-original=\"http://media.new.mensxp.com/media/content/2016/May/bollywod-legend-shashi-kapoors-biography-released-652x400-1-1462879244.jpg\" />&copy; Yash Raj Films</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Mere paas maa hai&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And the halls went silent.
