While the mask was seen as a concept, what if we viewed it as a person? If that is the case, then that person could very well be Vajpayee\u2019s principal secretary cum National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Vajpayee-Mishra formed an odd couple. Vajpayee was an out and out Sangh hardliner and totally unacceptable to Lutyens Delhi. Mishra was the son of a Congress Chief Minister close to legendary Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">An IFS man, ambassador and a permanent representative to the United Nations, Mishra was the ultimate insider and had contacts that spanned the entire network of Lutyens Delhi. In fact while Vajpayee was looked with suspicion, Mishra was welcomed with open arms.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">So successful was Mishra that most of Lutyens Delhi had totally got used to Vajpayee and backed another term for him by 2004. The surprise loss and the Vajpayee-Mishra exit made the BJP a pariah yet again.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">In fact Mishra was an excellent mukhauta of Vajpayee and the two had become inseparable.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">When another hardliner in the form of Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, people thought that he would be different and he wouldn\u2019t need a mask. But a mask he took all the same. And that mukhauta was Arun Jaitley.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Jaitley, like Mishra,<a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/how-everybody-loves-arun-jaitley-news-columns-pmwpk3ebbdfjd.html\"> is the perfect Lutyens insider and everybody loves him</a>. He can deal with the Congress and every other party. The media rarely attacks him and if #AdarshLiberals had to pick one BJP politician they would be willing to do business with, then it would probably be Jaitley.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Like Vajpayee-Mishra, Modi-Jaitley too formed the odd couple. Jaitley would make Modi acceptable and make deals with the Opposition and handle the Congress well. Or so most thought!</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">After two years, the partnership seems to have broken down. The Congress is on the warpath. Bills are not being passed. Modi is being attacked virulently (not Jaitley though). The Enforcement Directorate (under Finance Minister Jaitley) doesn\u2019t seem to have looked much into cases like the National Herald.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">BJP supporters are getting impatient as to how nobody, not even \u201cprivate citizens\u201d like Robert Vadra and Karti Chidambaram have been arrested despite the umpteen allegations floating against them in the media.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">In fact Jaitley is powerful within the BJP, has good relations with the Congress, other parties and media. However, you only have to look to Twitter and see the rage against him where he is seen as an ineffectual figure too soft on the opposition.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">The turning point seems to be the Delhi and Bihar Assembly polls where the BJP got absolutely plastered in the former and saw a loss of face in the latter. If you note closely, then that seemed to be the turning point.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Modi seems to have toughened his stand. The ED and other investigative bodies seemed to have suddenly become more active. BJP MPs are trying to go on the offensive instead of defending the party lamely.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">The leaks have increased and it is no co-incidence that the Congress is getting one bad news after another with the latest being AgustaWestland. Nothing symbolizes the new attitude than maverick Subramanian Swamy who joined the BJP some time back and became a Rajya Sabha MP recently.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">It seems the proverbial cat has been set among the pigeons. Swamy seems to have taken over the Rajya Sabha proceedings completely. Everything is about him. It\u2019s either his speeches or attacks against him or his remarks which have been expunged.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar gave such a detailed point by point and factual account of AgustaWestland that the government finally seems serious in taking Congress President Sonia Gandhi head on.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Swamy also brought up controversial and hardline things like the Ram Mandir issue which seemed to be on the backburner to many BJP supporters. The BJP has changed and become more aggressive and the new face of this is definitely Swamy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Swamy has even launched an attack indirectly on a mysterious person called \u201cSakuni\u201d on Twitter which his supporters staunchly claim is Jaitley. It is difficult to see all this being done without the consent of Modi.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">In fact another Jaitley baiter Navjot Singh Sidhu (allegedly upset at losing his Amritsar ticket to Jaitley) also entered the Rajya Sabha with Swamy. There are rumours of Modi considering a new Finance Minister. Jaitley\u2019s role seems to have been much diminished in the Modi Raj.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">From 1998-2004, Mishra was Vajpayee\u2019s mukhauta.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">From 2014-2016, Jaitley was Modi\u2019s mukhauta.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">So the question to be asked is: Is Swamy now Modi\u2019s new mukhauta?</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">If that\u2019s the case, then there is one major difference. While Mishra and Jaitley are moderates and Lutyens insiders, that is not the case with Swamy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Swamy is more hardline than Modi. Swamy is more of an outsider than Modi. Swamy is hated more in Lutyens Delhi than Modi. Swamy is more attacking than Modi.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">During the 2002 elections Modi made his famous \u201cHum paanch hamare pachees\u201d barb against Muslims but got his act together after that. Look at all of Modi\u2019s speeches from 2013 onwards and you will struggle to find things that will mark him as an RSS hardliner. It\u2019s all about development and governance.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">That is not the case with Swamy who speaks on Hinduism, Ayodhya, Uniform Civil Code, putting Sonia in jail etc more openly and strongly. In fact Swamy even called Mishra a Trojan horse for the Congress in a recent interview!</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">While hardline Vajpayee wore a moderate mask, it seems that hardline Modi has just taken on an ultra hardline mask! Either way, this marks a new turning point in Modi\u2019s term. Watch this space closely!</p></span><br><div><b>Read More:</b></div><p><font color=\"#0000ee\"><b><u><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/why-i-totally-support-uber-s-surge-pricing-news-columns-qfglA8cfaffad.html\">Why I totally support Uber's surge pricing...</a></u></b></font><br><br><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/how-everybody-loves-arun-jaitley-news-columns-pmwpk3ebbdfjd.html\"><b>How everybody loves Arun Jaitley!&nbsp;</b></a><br><br><b><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/time-to-snap-all-ties-with-pakistan-immediately-news-columns-qbgjR4djcdjff.html\">Time to snap all ties with Pakistan immediately?</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br><b><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/national-herald-case-is-this-the-end-game-for-sonia-gandhi-news-columns-pmvlJjhghejge.html\">National Herald Case: Is this the end-game for Sonia Gandhi?&nbsp;</a><br><br></b><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/25-controversies-of-narendra-modi-imagegallery-features-plqmnodhgeieg.html\"><b>25 controversies of Narendra Modi</b></a><br><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/seven-reasons-to-fear-lalu-prasad-yadav-news-columns-plmh4pihchaia.html\"><b><br></b></a><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/seven-reasons-to-fear-lalu-prasad-yadav-news-columns-plmh4pihchaia.html\"><b>Seven reasons to fear Lalu Prasad Yadav</b></a><br><br><img src=\"http://im.sify.com/index2/images/apr2011/Sunil_11april11_100x100.jpg\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; vertical-align: middle; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><i>The author is a Bangalore-based journalist and blogger.

Most economists still expect the central bank to raise interest rates early next year if Britain stays in.</p>  <p>\"The Bank stepped up its warnings about the potentially damaging impact of the UK leaving the EU,\" Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said, adding that the Bank recognises that their updated projections carry \"huge uncertainty\".</p>  <p>\"As such, growth would (be) weaker and inflation higher in the event of a UK exit.\" </p>  <p>As expected, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0 to keep rates on hold at a record-low 0.5 percent this month, in line with economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll. </p>  <p>Some economists had seen an outside chance that a policymaker could vote to cut rates for the first time since 2009 due to signs of a renewed economic slowdown.</p>  <p>Last year the central bank started to lay the groundwork for a rate rise, but - as on previous occasions - it was forced to put its plans on hold.</p>  <p/>  <p> (Writing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa; Editing by Hugh Lawson)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/bank-of-england-warns-of-sharp-sterling-fall-if-uk-votes-to-leave-eu-news-policy-qfmteofbajfja.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/us-jobless-claims-hit-more-than-1-year-high-import-prices-rise-news-policy-qfmtevdbjbeah.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 12 May 2016 13:34:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[U.S. jobless claims hit more than 1-year high; import prices rise]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qfmteucjcgbga.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<p>By Lucia Mutikani</p>  <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week to the highest level in more than a year, raising further concerns about the health of the labor market in the wake of a slowdown in job gains in April.</p>  <p>Other data on Thursday showed import prices increased in April for a second straight month, suggesting that the disinflationary impulse from a strong dollar and lower oil prices, which has helped to hold inflation well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, was fading. </p>  <p>Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 for the week ended May 7, the highest level since late February 2015, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast initial claims slipping to 270,000 in the latest week.</p>  <p>\"Jobless claims have moved sharply higher in recent weeks, reinforcing concerns that labor market conditions have softened in response to the slowdown in the economy in recent months,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. </p>  <p>There was a surge last week in unadjusted jobless claims in New York state, likely as some striking Verizon workers filed for unemployment benefits. Unadjusted claims also rose in Pennsylvania and Michigan. </p>  <p>Despite the jump last week, claims have remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy job market conditions, for 62 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.     The four-week moving average of claims, considered a bettermeasure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-weekvolatility, increased 10,250 to 268,250 last week, the highest level in almost three months.</p>  <p>The claims report came on the heels of data last week showing nonfarm payrolls increased only 160,000 in April, the smallest gain in seven months, after advancing by 208,000 in March. The signs of labor market weakness suggest the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates before the end of the year.</p>  <p>The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.</p>  <p>The dollar trimmed gains versus the yen and euro after the report. U.S. stock index futures also pared gains, while prices for U.S. government bonds were trading lower.</p>  <p/>  <p>WEAKER DOLLAR</p>  <p>The labor market has been fairly robust despite a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter. </p>  <p>The spike in jobless claims and moderation in employment gains likely do not suggest a deterioration given difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. The almost one-month long Verizon strike may also be boosting claims.</p>  <p>A report on Tuesday showed job openings hit an eight-month high in March, with the rate re-testing its post-recession high.     Thursday's claims report showed the number of people stillreceiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 37,000 to 2.16 million in the week ended April 30. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 3,750 to 2.14 million, the lowest reading since November 2000. </p>  <p>In a second report, the Labor Department said import prices increased 0.3 percent last month after a similar gain in March. The rise last month reflected a pick-up in oil prices and the dollar's depreciation.</p>  <p>Prices for imported goods were down 5.7 percent in the 12 months through April, reflecting the lingering effects of the   dollar's sharp rally and the oil price plunge between June 2014 and December 2015.</p>  <p>The dollar has this year weakened 2.5 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners. The greenback gained 20 percent on a trade-weighted basis between  June 2014 and December 2015.

Germany only sold more goods to the United States and France.</p>  <p>Boven said the British market had helped stabilise the German economy at a time when the global economic environment had been tough, so the exporting sector would be directly hit if Britain were to leave the EU.</p>  <p/>  <p> (Reporting by Rene Wagner; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/brexit-would-cost-german-economy-up-to-50-bln-by-end-2017---study-news-others-qfmtercdjehje.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/indias-retail-inflation-snaps-easing-trend-interest-rates-seen-on-hold-news-others-qfmsGxbjjichj.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 12 May 2016 13:12:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[India's retail inflation snaps easing trend, interest rates seen on hold]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qfmsGwjhefdhf.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's headline inflation broke a recent slowing trend in April, reducing the odds of further interest rate cuts next month by the Reserve Bank of India, even as industrial output expanded at a much-slower-than expected pace in March.</p>  <p>Consumer price inflation, which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) targets in setting interest rates, rose at a faster-than-expected pace, to 5.39 percent last month, from 4.83 percent in March.</p>  <p>It was the first pickup in retail inflation since January.</p>  <p>The pace of price gains in April was driven mainly by higher food costs.

We are working hard on this,\" Xavier Ursat, EDF head of new nuclear, told shareholders at their annual general meeting.</p>  <p>India, more than any other country, is the place where building nuclear plants makes sense, because of its huge power demand and the need to replace polluting coal, he said.</p>  <p>Ursat said many countries are interested in building nuclear plants or upgrading their existing fleet and that EDF - which is acquiring the reactor building arm of Areva - is positioning itself in this market. </p>  <p>He said that China, where EDF is building two nuclear reactors, would build half of the world's new nuclear reactors over the next 15 years but said nothing about possible new contracts for EDF there.</p>  <p>He added that South Africa is preparing a nuclear tender, while in Europe Poland is looking at starting a nuclear programme and the Czech Republic is considering renewing its fleet. </p>  <p>Ursat said EDF's planned 18-billion-pound ($26 billion) Hinkley Point project, which he described as probably the biggest industrial project in Europe, is crucial for EDF and the French nuclear industry.</p>  <p>\"Hinkley Point will help us continue our activities and preserve our skills base and jobs,\" he said.</p>  <p>He said that EDF's new EPR reactor in Flamanville is expected to be completed by the end of 2018, while the Hinkley Point project would pour its first concrete by mid-2019 provided a final investment decision is taken shortly.</p>  <p>He added that by the time Hinkley is completed, it will be time for EDF to start renewing France's fleet of 58 reactors, which were built largely in the 1980s and 1990s and have a 40-year lifespan. </p>  <p>Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy told shareholders that EDF needs growth in international markets because European power markets are stagnant.</p>  <p>($1 = 0.6916 pounds)</p>  <p/>  <p> (Editing by Jason Neely)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/edf-to-propose-deal-for-6-nuclear-reactors-in-india-by-year-end-news-others-qfmsyPjejfacb.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/india-urges-posco-to-use-local-raw-material-for-auto-steel-plant-news-international-qfmsanigjcbfc.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 12 May 2016 12:30:00 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[India urges POSCO to use local raw material for auto steel plant]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>By Sankalp Phartiyal</p>  <p>NEW DELHI, May 12 (Reuters) - New Delhi urged South Koreansteelmaker POSCO last month to buy local rawmaterial for its automotive steel plant in western India, twogovernment sources said, trying to cut imports and boostdomestic production of high-value steel.</p>  <p>The steel ministry's request to POSCO came amid otherefforts to safeguard local mills, including import taxes onsteel products and a floor price on overseas purchases. NewDelhi also initiated probes into the possible dumping of cheapsteel into India by China, Japan and South Korea.</p>  <p>POSCO primarily produces high-tensile auto grade steel fromits facility in Maharashtra state and has been importing most ofthe raw material - hot-rolled (HR) coils - from Korea, helped bya free trade agreement between New Delhi and Seoul.</p>  <p>But POSCO's costs rose after India imposed a \"safeguard\"import duty of up to 20 percent starting September last year.</p>  <p>POSCO told the steel ministry, according to a governmentdraft agenda for a meeting on the issue that was seen byReuters, that the raw material for their plant was not availablein India and needed to be given an exemption from the taxes.</p>  <p>The steel ministry in an April meeting requested POSCO touse HR coils produced by Indian steel companies JSW Steel, Essar Steel and Tata Steel, twosteel ministry officials said.
