Cheggit out..</h3>\n<p>So since yesterday there have been reports on how <a title=\"Sunny Leone\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/sunny-leone/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunny Leone</a> has added a &#8216;No kissing policy&#8217; to her contract.<span id=\"more-718405\"></span> It all started with an observation made by a few who argued the reason why there have been no kissing scenes in any of Sunny&#8217;s recent films after Ragini MMS 2 is because the actress has warned the filmmakers that she will never kiss on screen. In fact, the observation was further proved in reference to her latest film One Night Stand which despite being based on an adult subject surprisingly had no liplocks between Sunny and her co-star. However, wait until you check out this latest picture.</p>\n<p>Sunny, who celebrates her 35th birthday today, just put up this super hot picture of her kissing her husband Daniel Weber, quashing all the baseless rumours surrounding her &#8216;No Kissing Clause&#8217;. Yes! Taking up to Instagram, she also captioned this intimate moment saying, &#8220;Who said I don&#8217;t kiss on camera?!?!?! Ahem! Now isn&#8217;t that enough to clarify your qualms? Not to forget, <a title=\"Sunny Leone does NOT have a no-kissing clause, clarifies Daniel Weber!\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/sunny-leone-does-not-have-a-no-kissing-clause-clarifies-daniel-weber/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel too had EXCLUSIVELY </a>revealed to BollywoodLife that Sunny hasn&#8217;t put up any such clause in her contract.\u00a0Instead, the creative decisions are taken with other actors and the director.</p>\n<p>Well, we love how Ms Leone has hit back in style, that too on her very birthday. Indeed, this picture must have come as a perfect return gift to all you fans. Right guys? Drop your love for Sunny in the comments below and do come back to BollywoodLife for more updates.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t                \n\t\t\n\t<enclosure url='http://st1.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/718435.jpg' type='image/jpg' />\n\t\t<articletype>Article</articletype>\n\n\t\t<categoryBadge><![CDATA[News & Gossip]]></categoryBadge>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>SHOCKING!

Rajinikanth's Kabali BEATS Salman Khan's Sultan!\" src=\"http://st1.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/718429.jpg\" /></p><h3>Read on to know why we say so&#8230;</h3>\n<p>We all know <a title=\"Salman Khan\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/salman-khan/\" target=\"_blank\">Salman Khan</a> and <a title=\"Rajinikanth\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/rajinikanth/\" target=\"_blank\">Rajinikanth</a> are HUGE superstars in their own space. Both the superstars have their own kingdoms (Bollywood and South respectively) and millions of fans too, however these two giants haven&#8217;t ever clashed with one another.<span id=\"more-718408\"></span> There were reports that Salman Khan&#8217;s <em>Sultan</em> and Rajinikanth&#8217;s<em> Kabali</em> were going to clash this Eid, however yesterday we revealed to you how the clash has been averted after the makers of <a title=\"Kabali\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/movies/kabali/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Kabali</em></a> decided to release the film on July 1, a week before Sultan&#8217;s release. But it is Rajinikanth&#8217;s <em>Kabali</em> which has beat Salman Khan&#8217;s <em>Sultan</em> in a unique way. How?</p>\n<p>The <em>Kabali</em> teaser has outperformed <a title=\"Sultan\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/movies/sultan/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sultan</em></a>&#8216;s teaser to become the most watched teaser ever. When the <em>Kabali</em> teaser was released on May 1, no one thought it would break records so many records, but it did! In just a day, the teaser crossed 5 million views and today, the <em>Kabal</em>i teaser crossed 17.1 million views, making it the most watched teaser. The record was previously held by Aamir&#8217;s <em>Dhoom 3</em> and Salman&#8217;s <em>Sultan</em> with just over 17 million views.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Kabali teaser: God\u2026oops, Rajinikanth is BACK in his most STYLISH, SLICK avatar in this brilliant promo!\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/kabali-teaser-god-oops-rajinikanth-is-back-in-his-most-stylish-sleek-avatar-in-this-brilliant-promo/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Kabali</em></a>, directed by Pa Ranjith, is about an ageing don. With the teaser doing so well, we are sure that the <em>Kabali</em> will do fabulous at the box office. The distribution rights for the film are already selling at record prices. The audio of the film will be released on May 30 and the movie will hit theatres on July 1.</p>\n<p>What do you think about <a title=\"It\u2019s official!

While they have never openly admitted that they are in a relationship, close sources always maintained that they were very much together. However, <span id=\"more-718398\"></span>with these reports of them fighting constantly making headlines, people thought that there was trouble in paradise and they would go separate ways. But seems like there is no truth the ongoing buzz.</p>\n<p>We already know that the cute couple are going to romance each other in <a title=\"Not Hrithik Roshan but Sidharth Malhotra has been approached opposite Alia Bhatt for Aashiqui 3!\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/not-hrithik-roshan-but-sidharth-malhotra-has-been-approached-opposite-alia-bhatt-for-aashiqui-3/\"><em>Aashiqui 3</em></a> and now, according to Filmfare, they have signed on for another film with Karan Johar&#8217;s Dharma Productions. The film will again be an intense love story and while we saw Fawad Khan in their last film together (Kapoor &amp; Sons), this time we hear that it might just be the two of them.</p>\n<p>At a recent event, when Alia was asked about their issues, she deflected the question and said, &#8220;Yaha par hum Ikk kudi ke baare mai baat kar rahe hai toh aap munde ko ghar pe hi chod dijiye (We are talking about a girl here, so leave the guy at home only).&#8221;</p>\n<p>But this development puts an end to all those break up rumours.

In fact, even their wedding invites, gifts, mehendi and everything was personalised with &#8216;Monkey&#8217; written/drawn on it.

Here's what the actress has to say...\" src=\"http://st1.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/718351.jpg\" /></p><h3>Sunny Leone makes an affirmation on her 35th birthday, talks about her husband and lots more\u2026</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Sunny Leone\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/sunny-leone/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunny Leone </a>has already had her fair share of controversies this year \u2014 the most notable being on a TV news channel where she was asked harsh questions about her past as a former adult star. <span id=\"more-718336\"></span>But Sunny sailed through that with dignity and plenty of support from B-Town and today has moved on. She turns 35 today (May 13) and we catch up with the actress who\u2019s shooting for Splitsvilla in Puducherry&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>How are you planning to celebrate your birthday this year?</strong></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have any particular plans other than working. I don\u2019t expect much from anyone, but I did hear that my team has something planned. They are very sweet. My husband is also flying down to the Splitsvilla set from the US to spend time with me.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you usually celebrate your birthdays?</strong></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t usually celebrate them. The last few years I have been working. I think for most people the best birthdays were when we are younger. As a kid you look forward to your birthday and the party that is planned. Now I am happy to just spend it quietly and I only expect a couple of people to wish me happy birthday who are closest to me.</p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the best birthday gift that Daniel has given you?</strong></p>\n<p>With Daniel my birthday is a year-long one as he is always showering me with gifts. I am a lucky girl. But a gift I would like to give myself is a day with my family and dogs. That would be the best gift in the world!</p>\n<p><strong>You love animals?</strong></p>\n<p>I have always loved animals. And as you go through life you also become aware of them and how much love a little or big animal can give you. Their innocence and purity is what draws me to them. They want to just be exactly what they are and have no bad intentions towards anyone so we as human beings must nurture their wants and shower them with love.</p>\n<p><strong>When you entered Bollywood did you come with any expectations?</strong></p>\n<p>No, I did not come with any expectations. It was all really new to me and I did and still now think this is a big gift and opportunity that was offered to me. I believe in hard work and at this moment in my life my work and working hard is my main priority. I am not someone that focuses on birthdays or holidays. I know realistically that all will end one day and when it does then I can celebrate my birthday and holidays every day.</p>\n<p><strong>What has been the toughest challenge till now?</strong></p>\n<p>The toughest challenge is trying to figure out what is the next movie I should sign. I have realised that there is no way to surely know if a film you choose is the right decision or not. I have seen so many films in these years that people are expecting to do well and they don\u2019t do well at the box office. And for no rhyme or reason a movie you didn\u2019t know about does amazingly well. I have come to the conclusion that my main goal is to just keep making movies where I love the story. If I love it then I am making it. As long as movies are being offered to me then I will continue to work. I have to let the production house do its job to promote the movie well and hope it does. If they don\u2019t, I can\u2019t take it personally. It\u2019s hard to do this and I am still trying to come to terms with this but I have to try.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you cheer yourself up when you feel low?</strong></p>\n<p>I try my hardest to engross myself in work. I tell myself that I work every day and that is all that matters. I internalise it and then push it away and look to the positive. I have some amazing people around me that love me and make me feel better. Knowing my family and friends are happy, safe and healthy is what makes me happy. I hate seeing others hurt or people in pain \u2014 it affects me deeply.</p>\n<p><strong>People have always said you and Daniel are madly in love.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes we are. He is my best friend, my lover, my confidant, and my whole world. I respect him as a person and he does the same for me. We met each other at a hard time in our lives and we got through it together. God took my parents from me and he gave me Daniel as my angel to watch over me and my brother. He is the one person who looked after the both of us when it felt like our world had ended with my parents dying. We always work together and have clear boundaries. We talk about everything. Yes we are like all normal couples who bicker back and forth but at the end of the night we always say I love you to each other.</p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s been seven years since your marriage. Seven ways to a perfect marriage?</strong></p>\n<p>Respect, compromise, unconditional love, generosity (I don\u2019t mean gifts/ I mean with affection and love), compatibility, more love and as I always say \u2018Happy wife\u2026 Happy life!\u2019 Lol.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think of Bollywood actresses Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra making it in Hollywood today?</strong></p>\n<p>I think that it is wonderful. That world is so different to Bollywood and I know that it is very difficult to make an impact there. They have done something that most actors want to achieve. I am so proud of them!</p>\n<p><strong>Are you a feminist?</strong></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t like labels. I do believe that as a woman I must stand on my own two feet and work to the best of my ability. I do not let people pull me down. They try to push and I might fall but I promise I will stand again and I will be stronger. It\u2019s a tough world in general. I have had women and men who have not been nice, so for me everyone is the same and if you want to succeed then you must push forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you and Ekta Kapoor had a fall out? Since post Ragini MMS2 you haven\u2019t done a film together.</strong></p>\n<p>No not at all. I own a BCL team with her show. We see each other often and are friends. We have not done another film because that is just how it has worked out. It has no bearing on our relationship or respect for each other. I admire her a lot as a woman and as a businesswoman.</p>\n<p><strong>What made you decide to produce Bollywood films?</strong></p>\n<p>It is the other way around. Bollywood decided on me! I have always wanted to make mainstream films and when it was presented to me I took it with both hands and jumped in. We are still developing things. I have signed on other movies as an actress and once that is finished then I will be able to focus on my own. I am not someone that wants to rush into this at all. It is all a process and I want to do it right. That I am very clear about.</p>\n<p><strong>Your life has been a very interesting one. Ever thought of a biography on yourself?</strong></p>\n<p>Not at this moment but it is something that is proposed to me all the time. I think people are definitely curious about my life so we shall see when the right time to take that forward will be.</p>\n<p><strong>Aamir Khan had said he would cast you in one of his films.</strong></p>\n<p>I am always grateful that he even said that out loud. We will see what happens.</p>\n<p><strong>One liners</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Beyonce or Rihanna or Madonna? And why?</strong></p>\n<p>Beyonce because I love that she doesn\u2019t care about anything and does what she wants.</p>\n<p><strong>Flirty or intense romance?</strong></p>\n<p>Intense romance.</p>\n<p><strong>Three quality that draws you to a man</strong></p>\n<p>Confidence, style and his business sense.</p>\n<p><strong>A quality in a man that puts you off</strong></p>\n<p>Arrogance.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a Mr Perfect?</strong></p>\n<p>Always\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Live in relationships are\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>Are ways to get to know your partner. See if you need two bathrooms or not because boys can be messy. Lol.</p>\n<p><strong>One mantra you live by\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>Create my own path.</p>\n<p><strong>Describe yourself in five words\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>Hard-working, driven, ambitious, silly and happy.</p>\n<p><strong>One professional mistake that you will never make\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>Second guess who I am.</p>\n<p><strong>Three things you would want to change about yourself\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>Caring too much about others when they don\u2019t give a #$%&amp; about me, try to be more open minded about changes, OCD with time.</p>\n<p><strong>Three things you wish you had\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>My parents, that my brother lived walking distance to me and a horse.</p>\n<p><strong>Three people you rely on/trust completely and why\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>My husband \u2014 obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>My brother \u2014 because he is my blood and we are very close.</p>\n<p>Hitesh Kipopara, my stylist, because he has been by my side through my journey here in Bollywood. Good times and bad\u2026 Money and no money. He is my brother from another mother.</p>\n<p><strong>Three moments you want to relive?</strong></p>\n<p>My wedding, when I purchased my home \u2014 such a proud moment for Daniel and because we both struggled to get it and when Aamir Khan called me after my interview with CNN/IBN and Shah Rukh Khan asked me to do a song in his movie.</p>\n<p><strong>An incident in your life that affected you the most and why?</strong></p>\n<p>When my parents died&#8230; I talk about this a lot because I see where I am today and I hope that they are proud of me. I wish everyday that I could just call them and tell them about it all.</p>\n<p><strong>Three times you felt let down\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>I feel down when my movies don\u2019t do well, when people unnecessarily attack me and when i miss my family and dogs in the US.</p>\n<p><strong>An average day in your life\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>Every single day is different but mainly I work and work some more. My day starts with breakfast, gym, working on set or promotions and that\u2019s it but every day the job changes. It\u2019s never the same.</p>\n<p><strong>My song of the moment:</strong></p>\n<p>Bad Reputation by Joan Jett</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t                \n\t\t\n\t<enclosure url='http://st1.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/718351.jpg' type='image/jpg' />\n\t\t<articletype>Article</articletype>\n\n\t\t<categoryBadge><![CDATA[News & Gossip]]></categoryBadge>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Sunny Leone birthday special: Baby Doll, Pink Lips, Do Peg Maar &#8211; take a look at 7 sizzling songs of the actress!</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/sunny-leone-birthday-special-baby-doll-pink-lips-do-peg-maar-take-a-look-at-7-eye-catching-songs-of-the-actress/</link>\n\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 04:50:10 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator>Karan shah</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News & Gossip]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Baby Doll]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kabhi Jo Badal Barse]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Laila]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[One Night Stand]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Pink Lips]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sunny Leone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sunny Leone birthday]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sunny Leone birthday special]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sunny Leone hot and sexy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[sunny leone songs]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.bollywoodlife.com/?p=718223</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[After appearing on Bigg Boss 5, Sunny Leone entered Bollywood and made it her home.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img title=\"Sunny Leone birthday special: Baby Doll, Pink Lips, Do Peg Maar - take a look at 7 sizzling songs of the actress!\" src=\"http://st1.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/718371.jpg\" /></p><h3>The actress celebrates her 35th birthday today&#8230;</h3>\n<p>After appearing on <em>Bigg Boss 5</em>, <a title=\"Sunny Leone\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/sunny-leone/\">Sunny Leone</a> entered Bollywood and made it her home.

After nearly 13 years, the Khan family was relieved but the joy was short lived as one after the other, someone would challenge the decision of the high court.<span id=\"more-718276\"></span> Earlier, the <a title=\"Salman Khan hit and run case: Maharashtra government to appeal in Supreme Court against actor\u2019s acquittal\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/salman-khan-hit-and-run-case-maharshtra-government-to-appeal-in-supreme-court-against-actors-acquittal/\">Maharashtra government</a> tried to challenge the decision and now, the victim of the accident has also appealed in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Niyamat Shaikh, who was allegedly hit by Salman Khan&#8217;s car, has appealed against the actor&#8217;s acquittal in the case.

Are you excited to see her on the red carpet?</h3>\n<p>So for everyone who has been eagerly waiting for <a title=\"Aishwarya Rai Bachchan\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/aishwarya-rai-bachchan/\" target=\"_blank\">Aishwarya Rai Bachchan</a> to walk the red carpet at Cannes 2016, today is the day.<span id=\"more-718280\"></span> Yes! The Sarbjit actress along with her cutest companion Aaradhya has finally taken off to Cannes for the prestigious film festival &#8211; the proof of which lies right here in these above pictures. Spotted twinning with Aaradhya in black and white, the mother daughter duo were all smiles as they posed for the cameras at the airport. In fact, Aaradhya looked the happiest as she couldn&#8217;t stop giggling, walking hand in hand with her pretty mom. Aww! How we love this beautiful sight of Aaradhya accompanying Ash to the Cannes?</p>\n<p>Not to forget, it&#8217;s going to be Ash&#8217;s 15the year at the Cannes this year, which explains why everyone is super excited to see what she would be wearing at the red carpet this year. Will she go all desi slipping into a saree? Or will she experiment with her fashion choices by going bold and beautiful? Well, you can continue guessing but blame it on her Sarbjit promotions, Ash for all that we know, hasn&#8217;t got the time to prepare much for her Cannes appearance this year. In fact, she had even admitted the same in her earlier interview saying, &#8220;Cannes Festival is two days away and I still don\u2019t know what I am wearing.

Cannes Film Festival is essentially a platform to showcase talent from across the world and for trade, film reaches a lot more territories. But for India, more attention is paid to who&#8217;s wearing what on the red carpet with the gorgeous divas of Bolly-land strutting their stuff on it. However, since a few years, it has also triggered a few controversies which are unpleasant at best. Let&#8217;s take you on tour of the same&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Aunty mat kaho na!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><a title=\"Aishwarya rai bachchan\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/aishwarya-rai-bachchan\" target=\"_blank\">Aishwarya Rai </a>went to Cannes for the first time in 2002 with <a title=\"Shah Rukh Khan\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/shahrukh-khan/\" target=\"_blank\">Shah Rukh Khan </a>and Sanjay Leela Bhansali on tow at the premiere of <em>Devdas</em>. Since then she has been a regular as she became the ambassador of a cosmetic brand. But in 2009, there were talks that the company has replaced her with <a title=\"Sonam Kapoor\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/sonam-kapoor\" target=\"_blank\">Sonam Kapoor</a> as they were looking for a younger fresh face. So when the actress was asked to comment on it, she said, &#8220;Aishwarya Rai is an actress who used to work with my dad (Anil Kapoor), so I should call her aunty, right?&#8221; We wonder what <a title=\"Akshay Kumar\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/akshay-kumar\" target=\"_blank\">Akshay Kumar</a>&#8216;s son Aarav will call Sonam when he debuts. Just saying! Oh and this is how Aishwarya shot her down politely then&#8230;</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqajXcsrgB8\" height=\"380\" width=\"600\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em><strong>(Video credit: Zoom)</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Miss the Mrs</strong></p>\n<p>Last year, <a title=\"Katrina Kaif \" href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/Katrina-kaif\" target=\"_blank\">Katrina Kaif </a>debuted in Cannes and made a lot of headlines. Her getups were appreciated and talked about but it was her snub to a question about Aishwarya, that set tongues wagging. Katrina was asked if she would be exchanging tips from Sonam and Aishwarya since it&#8217;s a debut that year, she said, &#8220;I definitely intend to keep in touch with Sonam, get her feedback and tips. But beyond that I think if I was trying to emulate or copy someone, that would be wrong.\u201d Guess Salman has to be blamed here&#8230; ex of your ex always gets axed you see!</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/53kcd1Y0trw\" height=\"380\" width=\"600\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Mallika bares it all&#8230; with words we meant!</strong></p>\n<p>Mallika Sherawat walked on the red carpet for her film with Jackie Chan, Myth and our eyes popped. The dresses she wore made everyone take note of her. But that was nothing compared to her &#8216;India is hypocritical&#8217; verse that followed. That angered the whole country like never before. The &#8216;Dhirty phawhlitics&#8217; couldn&#8217;t really gain much despite such an explosive interview.</p>\n<p><div class='jwplayer' id='jwplayer-0'></div><script type='text/javascript'>if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-0').setup({\"width\":550,\"height\":350,\"primary\":\"flash\",\"image\":\"http://st1.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Mallika-Sherawat-at-Variety-Studio.jpg\",\"file\":\"http://st1.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Mallika-Sherawat-at-Variety-Studio.flv\"});\n</script></p>\n<p><strong>Count us out&#8230;err! Why?</strong></p>\n<p>Something really mysterious happened with the brand that both Aishwarya and Sonam endorse. They decided to cut them out of their print ad that had them with all the beautiful ladies associated with the brand from all over world. The explanation of the same is still awaited.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://st1.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/718181.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-718181\" alt=\"loreal-ad-cropped\" src=\"http://st1.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/718181.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>No designer for Richa?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>When Richa Chadda first time walked the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival, apparently, designers weren&#8217;t ready to dress her up. She had hurriedly pieced together a dress with the help of her friends, as per rumours. But in 2015, she had 15 designers queueing up to design her her gowns for the gala. So what changed?
