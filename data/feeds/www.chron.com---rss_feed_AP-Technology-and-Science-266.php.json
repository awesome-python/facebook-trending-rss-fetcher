share our bodies and our surroundings with teeming communities of microbes that are crucial to the health of people and the planet, and now the Obama administration is beginning a major project to better understand those invisible ecosystems \u2014 even control them.\n\nThe National Microbiome Initiative being announced by White House science officials Friday aims to bring together scientists who study the microbes that live in the human gut and in the oceans, in farm soil and in hospitals \u2014 to speed discoveries that could bring big payoffs.\n\nThe U.S. government spends about $300 million a year on microbiome research, until now mostly an effort to catalog different communities of bacteria, viruses and other microbes, Handelsman said.\n\nUnderstanding which soil bacteria help different plants grow could let scientists boost food production or repair eroded cropland.\n\nSince much of the world's population spends more time indoors than out, learning how we transfer microbes at home, at work, in hospital rooms could lead to healthier built environments. ]]></description>\n            <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 04:02:04 UT</pubDate>\n            </item>\n        <item>\n

confirm the topic is tied to a current news event; write a topic description with information corroborated by at least three of 1,000 news outlets ; apply a category label to the topic; and check to see whether the topic is covered by most or all of ten major media outlets (including The New York Times, Fox News, BuzzFeed and others). ]]></description>\n            <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016

in February but Republicans controlling Congress have been slow to react, and instead forced the administration last month to tap more than $500 million worth of unspent Ebola funding to battle Zika.\n\nPolls show that the public isn't anywhere nearly as scared of Zika as it was about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the handful of cases in the U.S. in 2014, but Zika awareness and anxiety is likely to grow as mosquito season heats up.\n\nThe Senate move is likely to set up a conflict with the House, where GOP leaders are likely to press for a much smaller amount and pay for it by cutting other programs or using leftover Ebola money that was passed at the end of 2014.\n\nThe Senate measure would also preserve an administration program that would use some of the leftover Ebola money to help poorer nations build up their health infrastructure. ]]></description>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:14:18 UT</pubDate>\n            </item>\n        <item>\n
