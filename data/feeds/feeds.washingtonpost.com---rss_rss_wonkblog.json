Meanwhile, Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders have upset expectations about both major parties' presidential primaries with unconventional campaigns.</p>\n<p>Political scientists still don't fully\u00a0understand the forces pushing\u00a0some in\u00a0both parties to\u00a0adopt more\u00a0extreme positions. As American politics continued to polarize in recent years, however,\u00a0trade with China might have\u00a0made the problem worse, according to <a href=\"http://www.ddorn.net/papers/ADHM-PoliticalPolarization.pdf\">new research</a>.</p>\n<p>Voters in places that were more exposed to\u00a0competition from Chinese imports became more likely to elect\u00a0lawmakers with more extreme views between 2002 and 2010, the research shows.</p>\n<p>\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a complete accident that both Sanders and\u00a0Trump are talking about the harms of trade,\" said\u00a0David Autor, an economist at\u00a0the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the authors of a draft of a paper on the results.</p>\n<p>The paper\u00a0focuses on Congress, so its implications for the current presidential campaign are unclear.\u00a0In Congress, polarization began a long time ago, so trade with China \u2014 which accelerated in the 21st century \u2014 can't be\u00a0the only thing\u00a0 driving\u00a0the parties away from each other.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137496\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2015/06/polarization-1.jpg\" alt=\"polarization-1\" width=\"2303\" height=\"2160\" /></p>\n<p>That said, the effects of Chinese trade are significant in themselves.\u00a0Autor estimates that if the volume of Chinese imports had increased at half the actual pace, there would be 18 fewer\u00a0conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives and four\u00a0fewer liberal Democrats. Instead,\u00a022 moderate lawmakers\u00a0from both parties would fill those seats.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-185675\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/05/max_moderates.png\" alt=\"max_moderates\" width=\"2300\" height=\"1820\" /></p>\n<p>To produce these estimates, Autor and his colleagues first had to determine how people in different parts of the country were affected by trade with China. In the\u00a0context of an increasingly globalized economy, the researchers\u00a0focused on the world's most populous country\u00a0because the effects\u00a0on U.S. workers\u00a0of China's rapidly expanding manufacturing sector\u00a0dwarfs the effects of\u00a0trade with other nations.</p>\n<p>It wasn't enough\u00a0to look at overall statistics on imports. Besides Chinese competition, domestic production can\u00a0be affected by any number of other factors that have nothing to do with trade: labor disputes, the cost of raw materials, the price\u00a0of energy, and so on.</p>\n<p>Instead, the economists\u00a0looked at data on\u00a0Chinese imports from\u00a0eight other countries around the world \u2014 on the assumption\u00a0that if Chinese textiles were becoming more popular in Switzerland, say, they would likely be more attractive to U.S.\u00a0consumers as well, regardless of local trends in the U.S. economy or the state of domestic industry.</p>\n<p class=\"interstitial-link\" channel=\"wp.com\">\n  <i>\n    [<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/11/the-problem-with-how-obama-thinks-about-american-politics/\">What Obama still doesn\u2019t get about American politics</a>]\n  </i>\n</p>\n<p>To the extent that U.S.\u00a0demand for Chinese textiles\u00a0was increasing, of course,\u00a0 the result was more competition for the domestic mills.\u00a0Autor and his colleagues scored areas of the United States with more textile manufacturing as more exposed\u00a0to Chinese imports. They did the same for furniture and other industries in which China was increasingly competitive.</p>\n<p>Then the economists\u00a0turned to lawmakers' voting records in the House between 2002 and 2010. Those who represented districts with greater exposure to Chinese competition\u00a0took more radical positions, regardless of their party \u2014 and even compared with districts with a large manufacturing sector\u00a0in industries that\u00a0weren't affected by Chinese trade.</p>\n<p>Autor and his colleagues accounted for other economic and demographic differences among districts, and since\u00a0their measure of Chinese competition was based on worldwide trends in trade and was unrelated to\u00a0local conditions in the United States, they concluded that\u00a0competition from Chinese imports in these districts must have somehow\u00a0polarized their representatives.</p>\n<p>Perhaps\u00a0when things go wrong for people, Autor said, they\u00a0try to\u00a0make sense of their problems based on whatever convictions they already hold.\u00a0Maybe workers who have steady employment pay little attention to partisan\u00a0critiques of national economic policy, but if\u00a0they are\u00a0displaced by trade, they go looking for answers. They\u00a0become more committed, emotionally and politically, to ideological\u00a0explanations of what went wrong as a way of making sense of their situation.</p>\n<p>In turn, they\u00a0insist that their\u00a0representatives in Washington hew to a more extreme set of positions.</p>\n<p>Autor believes that international trade can\u00a0be beneficial overall, but he\u00a0sees\u00a0the research as\u00a0a caution to himself and\u00a0others who share his view. The benefits of trade are distributed broadly, as consumers can enjoy cheaper goods made abroad. The\u00a0costs might not be\u00a0as great, but they are\u00a0a burden for\u00a0the\u00a0few\u00a0cities and towns that produced those goods domestically, where political resentment festers.</p>\n<p>Trade is typically a bipartisan issue, supported\u00a0by moderate politicians in both parties\u00a0over the objections of each party's more radical members.\u00a0Yet the results of the study suggest that\u00a0these moderate policymakers can become victims of their own successes as trade expands.</p>\n<p>\"It\u2019s quite possible for the pie to grow by 3\u00a0percent, and some slices to contract by 40 percent, and we\u2019ve seen that,\" Autor said. \"We still have lots of displaced people, lots of angry people.\"</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/12/trade-with-china-is-tearing-our-politics-apart/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The enormous ambition of Hillary Clinton\u2019s child-care plan</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/12/the-enormous-ambition-of-hillary-clintons-child-care-plan/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/12/the-enormous-ambition-of-hillary-clintons-child-care-plan/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:05:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Danielle Paquette]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/?p=185658</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton this week unveiled her vision for more quality child care in the United States, a lofty plan that includes raising pay for the industry\u2019s workers.

But the boldest idea targets parents, who now face day-care costs that rival college tuition. Clinton wants to cap that expense at 10\u00a0percent of a household\u2019s income. </span></p>\n<p>Considering that some people spend more on child care than rent, such a price shift would significantly ease the financial strain for families nationwide. Getting there, however, could be an extraordinary challenge.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Average child-care costs in the United States devour at least 30 percent of a minimum-wage worker\u2019s earnings in every state, according to </span><a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/child-care-affordability/#conclusion\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a report last year </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank.</span></p>\n<p>To pay for a year of full-time infant care in Hawaii, for example, where the median minimum wage in 2015 was $7.75, a full-time worker would have to fork over\u00a0every paycheck from January to September. Those at the bottom of the wage scale in New York and Massachusetts would have to spend about\u00a080 percent of their annual earnings.</p>\n<p>And in D.C., often cited as the country\u2019s priciest child-care market, minimum-wage workers would have to part ways with slightly more than their entire income.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese high costs severely squeeze working families, prevent too many children from getting a healthy start, and act as a disincentive for parents to stay in the workforce,\u201d the Clinton campaign said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Democratic contenders this election cycle have focused on the needs of working families.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clinton\u2019s child-care proposal follows her push for paid family leave and universal preschool. Her rival for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination,\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has pledged to tax </span><a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/249195-sanders-americas-childcare-system-is-an-embarrassment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the wealthy to create a public child-care</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Republican front-runner Donald Trump has largely avoided the subject. He has referred to child rearing in an interview about his personal life as </span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/24/trump-act-like-wife/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his wife\u2019s job</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The family, he said, does not employ nannies.</span></p>\n<p>Clinton intends to accomplish the 10\u00a0percent cap with tax credits and subsidized child care, according to her campaign. Details on how the plan would be funded and executed will come later this year, aides said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A proposal last year </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/02/this-could-be-the-new-big-idea-about-childcare-from-democrats/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from the Center for\u00a0American Progress</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a policy idea wellspring for Democrats, could offer a clue. Carmel Martin, CAP\u2019s vice president of policy, said she\u00a0has advised the Clinton campaign on child-care issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CAP recommended creating a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> new child-care tax credit, worth up to $14,000 per child. Under the plan, which would target low- and middle-income families, the tax credit would be advanced to parents on a monthly basis and paid directly to child-care provider. The centers, meanwhile, would qualify to receive federal money only if they complied with the state\u2019s quality standards.</span></p>\n<p>The market alone can\u2019t fix affordability and quality issues in American child care, Martin said. A government investment into the system, she said, would boost the current and future labor force.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge economic issue for American families,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s how we ensure people can go to work and be productive, and children can be in a safe, stable environment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finding a way to pay for day care remains a struggle for families across income levels. A Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-surprising-number-of-moms-and-dads-scaling-back-at-work-to-care-for-their-kids/2015/08/06/c7134c50-3ab7-11e5-b3ac-8a79bc44e5e2_story.html\">survey last year</a> found more than three-quarters of mothers and half of fathers say they\u2019ve skipped work opportunities, switched jobs or quit to watch\u00a0their kids.</p>\n<p>Over the last 30 years, weekly spending on child care for families with a working mother has nearly doubled, according to the Census Bureau. The average annual cost of infant care now exceeds the price of public college tuition in two-thirds of states.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Families on the poverty line qualify for public assistance. Obtaining that help, however, can become a lengthy trial. Just 17 percent of children eligible for child-care subsidies under federal law in 2011 received the aid, a report from </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/20/the-states-with-the-most-and-least-expensive-child-care/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an advocacy group in the nation\u2019s capital.</span></p>\n<p>Some kids are stuck on waiting lists for weeks, even months.

The governors are nominated by the White House and approved by the Senate, but regional bank presidents are selected by their boards of directors, whose occupants are chosen by the banking industry and by the Fed governors in Washington.</p>\n<p>In a statement to The Washington Post, Clinton\u2019s campaign said she supports removing bankers from the boards of directors and increasing diversity within the Fed.</p>\n<p>\"The Federal Reserve is a vital institution for our economy and the well-being of our middle class, and the American people should have no doubt that the Fed is serving the public interest,\u201d spokesman Jesse Ferguson said. \u201cThat's why Secretary Clinton believes that the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole and that commonsense reforms \u2014 like getting bankers off the boards of regional Federal Reserve banks \u2014 are long overdue.\u201d</p>\n<p>The statement puts Clinton on the same page as her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/opinion/bernie-sanders-to-rein-in-wall-street-fix-the-fed.html?_r=0\"> In an op-ed in the New York Times</a> in December, he said removing bankers from the Fed\u2019s governance would mean \u201cthe foxes would no longer guard the henhouse.\u201d</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Sanders and top Democratic lawmakers called on the Fed to increase the number of minorities in leadership positions. They also urged the central bank to consider the high unemployment rate among some racial groups as it debates whether to keep pulling back its support for the American economy.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9clry7n9BAreFRwQ184SHFnX1k/view\">letter </a>to Fed Chair Janet Yellen, the lawmakers argued that more minority representation would help broaden the Fed\u2019s internal discussions about the health of the economy. In addition to Sanders, 10 senators signed the letter, including banking committee members Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Robert Menendez of New Jersey. More than 100 congressmen\u00a0joined the effort, which was led in the House by Michigan Rep. John Conyers and gained support from\u00a0California Rep.

No one now in the top brass is Hispanic. </span></p>\n<p>In addition, an analysis by the progressive Center for Popular Democracy found that 83 percent of the boards of directors are white and three-fourths are male. The group also found that 39 percent of directors come from the financial industry, while 11 percent are from community groups, labor organizations or academia.</p>\n<p>There are nine seats on the boards of directors.

The Fed hiked interest rates in December for the first time since the Great Recession, citing the strength in the U.S. recovery. It had anticipated increasing rates four more times this year but has since downgraded that expectation amid weakness in the global economy. Investors around the world are now carefully watching to see what the Fed will do when it meets again in June.</p>\n<div class=\"flex-embed\">\n<div class=\"posttv-video-embed wpv-player\" data-uuid=\"8345ab9c-fd78-11e5-813a-90ab563f0dde\" data-object-id=\"57078e47e4b098fcd165adf5\" data-youtube-id=\"\" data-is-truth-teller=\"0\" data-max-width=\"500\" data-max-height=\"750\" data-show-endscreen=\"1\" data-show-promo=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/thumbnails/57078e47e4b098fcd165adf5/20160408_federalreserve.jpg\" data-headline=\"Fed chiefs join forces to calm fears\" data-duration=\"98000\" data-category-id=\"wirereuters\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-video-360=\"0\" data-variants=\"0\" ><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//js.washingtonpost.com/video/resources/env/WapoVideo/dist/WapoVideoEmbed.min.js\"></script></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Center for Popular Democracy and its activist coalition, Fed Up, are pressuring the central bank not to raise its benchmark interest rate until the unemployment rate falls to 4 percent.

At the same time, the companies that provide\u00a0prescription\u00a0coverage have increased the number of drugs they refuse to cover, in an effort to gain leverage with drug companies in price negotiations.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://csdd.tufts.edu/files/uploads/Summary-MayJunIR2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>\u00a0released on its website, researchers at the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development\u00a0illustrate how two profitable, behemoth industries \u2014\u00a0with drug companies that sell and develop treatments on the one side and with companies\u00a0that negotiate prices and pay for drugs on the other \u2014\u00a0make\u00a0shifting alliances with patients to protect their own interests.</p>\n<p>Each industry has its own seemingly pro-patient move: Drug manufacturers offer coupons to reduce\u00a0co-pays that people are faced with at the pharmacy counter. Pharmacy benefit-management companies, hired by\u00a0health-insurance companies to manage drug benefits, negotiate aggressively to\u00a0secure rebates that lower the cost of drugs.</p>\n<p>The study shows how\u00a0these tactics are actually parries and counterattacks in both industries' attempts to make money.</p>\n<p>\"There is a definite battle going on, and it\u2019s very unclear in May of 2016 who is winning this battle,\" said Joshua Cohen, a health economist at Tufts. \"It\u2019s a friendly battle -- \u00a0it\u2019s not war --but it is a battle between two industries, one the insurance and PBM [pharmacy benefit management] industry that\u2019s trying to rein in costs, and the drug industry that's trying to sell its wares.\"</p>\n<h3>The deceptive generosity of coupons</h3>\n<p>The drug industry has increasingly relied on coupons to sell its products during the past five years:\u00a0There were fewer than 100 brand-name drugs with coupon programs in 2009; Today, there are nearly 750 coupons to help patients pay for their drugs.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-185616\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/05/2300-4.jpg\" alt=\"2300 (4)\" width=\"2300\" height=\"1487\" /></p>\n<p>What could\u00a0be\u00a0better than a coupon? Patients\u00a0who pay $0 instead of $100 are grateful and get access to a prescription that they might otherwise have hesitated to fill. The coupon, however, might mean\u00a0a pricey brand-name drug costs less\u00a0for patients than\u00a0a cheaper generic \u2014\u00a0not the best outcome for the health-care system. Even though the drug company appears to be altruistically giving money to the patient, the\u00a0company\u00a0still gets the full amount insurance will pay.</p>\n<p>A 2013 <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/nejmp1301993\" target=\"_blank\">New England Journal of Medicine</a> study found that more than half of coupons were for brand-name medications with a cheaper, alternative medicine available.</p>\n<p>That irks the companies that cover prescription-drug benefits, which\u00a0call this the \"<a href=\"http://lab.express-scripts.com/lab/insights/industry-updates/the-dark-side-of-copay-coupons\" target=\"_blank\">dark side</a>\" of coupons, which aren't even legally allowed in government health plans like Medicare\u00a0because they're considered a kickback.\u00a0Pharmacy benefit-management companies carefully design their coverage, putting drugs on different tiers -- with brand-name drugs and those\u00a0that give unfavorable rebates typically on higher tiers that require larger\u00a0co-pays and with cheaper generics or other alternatives on lower tiers with smaller co-pays.</p>\n<h3>Fighting coupons by playing hardball</h3>\n<p>But as the number of coupons increased, pharmacy benefit companies haven't stood still, the report found. Over the past few years, they\u00a0have begun to play hardball by refusing to cover certain\u00a0drugs altogether to win more favorable rebates and discounts from drug companies. Using\u00a0the threat of exclusion,\u00a0pharmacy benefit companies have gained more leverage\u00a0in price negotiations with drug makers.</p>\n<p>The Tufts analysis shows how the number of excluded drugs has increased in recent years:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-185399\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/05/2300-2.jpg\" alt=\"2300 (2)\" width=\"2300\" height=\"1656\" /></p>\n<p>One such battle went <a href=\"http://lab.express-scripts.com/lab/insights/specialty-medications/expanding-access-to-a-hep-c-cure\" target=\"_blank\">very public\u00a0recently</a>, as the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, Express Scripts, excluded pricey hepatitis C drugs from coverage and won a more favorable price with a competing therapy. That means drug spending may go down, but because of the secrecy shrouding price negotiations, it's not clear how much of the savings are passed to health plans and patients.</p>\n<p>\"By opening up access to all clinically superior medications, and excluding a handful of 'me-too' products that have no clinical benefit beyond what\u2019s provided by more affordable alternatives, we have leverage to negotiate more effectively with manufacturers and ultimately achieve lower drug prices for the clients and patients we serve,\" Express Scripts spokesman David Whitrap wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>Excluding some drugs makes sense \u2014\u00a0if there's a cheaper equivalent or little evidence that one drug is more effective than another, a substitution is eminently reasonable.</p>\n<p>What the analysis\u00a0attempts\u00a0to demonstrate\u00a0is that exclusions are not being done with clinical superiority in mind. Instead, exclusions are made simply because the pharmacy benefit manager was able to negotiate a better price. As evidence of the arbitrariness of substitutions, Cohen of Tufts highlights 14 drugs that were excluded by one of the two big pharmacy benefit companies but included by another \u2014\u00a0which suggests the size of the rebates are driving the decisions.</p>\n<p>CVS Caremark spokeswoman Christine Cramer said that, on average, patients whose plans used\u00a0a selective formulary with restricted coverage of drugs saved almost $35 on each prescription and overall the approach has saved its clients\u00a0$6 billion since 2012.</p>\n<p>So far, the aggressive bargaining of pharmacy benefit companies seems to be increasing the secret rebates they\u00a0win. Richard Evans, an analyst at SSR Health, compared it to musical chairs \u2014\u00a0when there are a few major brands with comparable drugs in a category, the pharmacy benefit companies can simply take away a chair and exclude the drug, using that leverage to negotiate deeper discounts.</p>\n<p>A\u00a0major report on pharmaceutical spending last month highlighted the success that rebates were having in tempering the ever-rising prices of drugs. Pharmaceutical spending in the United States, as measured by the prices written on invoices, increased in 2015 to $425 billion \u2014\u00a0or a little more than 12 percent \u2014\u00a0compared with\u00a0the year before. But factoring in the rebates and discounts that drug companies provided, net spending was $310 billion \u2014\u00a0a little less than 9 percent increase, according to the analysis by IMS Health.</p>\n<p>But there are reasons that this system might not be the most efficient \u2014\u00a0either for health care or for prices. Doctors don't tend to like these kinds of tactics \u2014\u00a0it can feel like a middleman overriding medical expertise, potentially discouraging the use of pricey but necessary medications by putting them on tiers with higher co-pays or making providers submit extensive paperwork to get a drug covered.\u00a0And at least one insurer, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/21/anthem-sues-express-scripts-over-prescription-drug-pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthem</a>, has gone on the attack, arguing that Express Scripts isn't passing sufficient savings on.</p>\n<p>What's clear is that the two industries are jostling for advantages in\u00a0a game of chicken\u00a0where the patient is caught in the middle.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of the story incorrectly stated that CVS Health's savings using a selective formulary since 2012. The strategy has saved its clients more than $6 billion since 2012.\u00a0</em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/12/the-drug-price-arms-race-that-leaves-patients-caught-in-the-middle/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The social lives of rich people, explained</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/12/how-money-changes-everything-even-your-friendships/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/12/how-money-changes-everything-even-your-friendships/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 11:50:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Christopher Ingraham]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Economy]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/?p=185481</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Way back in 1983, Cyndi Lauper knew that \"money changes everything.\" Social science is finally starting to catch\u00a0up.

And when they socialize, they spend more time with friends than with family members or neighbors.</p>\n<p>There's a fairly robust body of research showing that \"having or thinking about money appears to heighten self-reliance and dampen attention and responsiveness to others,\" as Bianchi and Vohs put it.\u00a0In lab experiments, people who are primed to think of money <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/academics/philosophy/ethical-inquiry/sites/brown.edu.academics.philosophy.ethical-inquiry/files/uploads/Mogilner%20Psych%20Science%202010%20Time%20Money%20and%20Social%20Connection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">become more motivated to work</a> and less interested in socializing. Exposure to money <a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=43009\" target=\"_blank\">diminishes compassion toward others</a>. Wealthy people tend to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/social-class-empathy-study-2011-8\" target=\"_blank\">disengage from social interactions</a>.</p>\n<p>Bianchi and Vohs take these findings out of the lab to see whether\u00a0they hold up to real-world observation. They first looked at nearly 30,000 responses to the General Social Survey (GSS) to trace how household income affects respondents' social interactions. The GSS has repeatedly asked Americans how often they spend a \"social evening\" with relatives, neighbors and friends. Those questions draw a fairly robust portrait of Americans' social interactions. Bianchi and Vohs controlled for age, race, gender, marital status, household size, city size and hours worked to isolate the effect of money on relationships.</p>\n<p>The first thing they found was that people with higher incomes spent less time socializing overall: Compared to a low-income\u00a0individual (earning $5,000 a year), a person from a higher-income household ($131,000 a year) spends, on average, 6.4 fewer evenings each year socializing with other people \u2014 even after controlling for differences in hours worked.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but when wealthier people socialize, they\u00a0do so with different people: \"People in households with higher incomes spent significantly less time with relatives and neighbors and significantly more time with friends,\" Bianchi and Vohs found.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-185520\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/05/income-friends.png\" alt=\"income-friends\" width=\"2300\" height=\"1897\" /></p>\n<p>Compared with\u00a0people in the bottom 25 percent of household income, higher-income people (top 25 percent) spent an average of 4.6\u00a0fewer evenings with family and 8.3 fewer evenings with neighbors each year. But when it came to friends, the situation was reversed: Higher-income people spent about 5.2\u00a0<em>more</em> evenings with friends than their low-income counterparts. And those gaps get even wider as you move farther out on the income spectrum, as the chart above shows.</p>\n<p>But why?</p>\n<p>There are a number of potential explanations. Bianchi and Vohs note that family members and neighbors provide each other with tangible forms of social support: Your parents might give you financial support for large purchases, or you might rely on a neighbor to mow your lawn or fix your washing machine in a pinch.</p>\n<p>\"For people with limited financial resources, these social ties are likely to be crucial for managing existing and impending challenges,\" they write.</p>\n<p>If you rely on this type of support from family and neighbors, it's in your interest to cultivate these relationships \u2014\u00a0Mom's not going to help you with that TV purchase if you haven't visited in five years.</p>\n<p>But people with financial means don't need to worry about this as much. They pay a guy to mow the lawn, and if the washing machine breaks, they can either pay someone to fix it or simply buy a new one.\u00a0Being rich means you can spend your time with who you want, when you want \u2014\u00a0and that might mean that you spend more time\u00a0cultivating friendships you've built based on shared values and interests. \"Money frees people to be socially connected with those they choose rather than those who can provide resources,\" Bianchi and Vohs observe.</p>\n<p>Social scientists have noticed something of a fraying of the social fabric in recent decades. The number of people saying they have no close friends or family members <a href=\"http://asr.sagepub.com/content/71/3/353\" target=\"_blank\">roughly tripled between 1985 and 2004</a>, and the size of the average close social network <a href=\"http://time.com/3748090/friends-social-health/\" target=\"_blank\">has shrunk, too</a>.\u00a0Robert Putnam famously documented the factors driving these changes in his book \"<a href=\"http://bowlingalone.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bowling Alone</a>.\"</p>\n<p>But Bianchi and Vohs's work\u00a0suggests something else may be at work here as well: Inflation-adjusted household income <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/families/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">has risen considerably</a> since the World War II era (even if it's been fairly stagnant in the past decade). And if the relationship between income and social behavior they describe is true, then it's only natural that decreasing social interactions will be one consequence of that change.</p>\n<p>Take it away, Cyndi:</p>\n<div class=\"flex-embed\"><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pp4suZ4jNXg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"flex-embed\">\n<div class=\"posttv-video-embed wpv-player\" data-uuid=\"54982560-ea4d-11e5-a9ce-681055c7a05f\" data-object-id=\"56e7656be4b02f10a5bb47a8\" data-youtube-id=\"x1xMkf7Z_Ac\" data-is-truth-teller=\"0\" data-max-width=\"500\" data-max-height=\"750\" data-show-endscreen=\"1\" data-show-promo=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/thumbnails/56e7656be4b02f10a5bb47a8/20160313_100yrsold.jpg\" data-headline=\"Meet four lifelong friends who will all turn 100 this summer\" data-duration=\"132000\" data-category-id=\"segments\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-video-360=\"0\" data-variants=\"0\" ><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//js.washingtonpost.com/video/resources/env/WapoVideo/dist/WapoVideoEmbed.min.js\"></script></div>\n</div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/12/how-money-changes-everything-even-your-friendships/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The middle class is shrinking just about everywhere in America</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/the-middle-class-is-shrinking-just-about-everywhere-in-america/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/the-middle-class-is-shrinking-just-about-everywhere-in-america/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 21:07:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Emily Badger and Christopher Ingraham]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Economy]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/?p=185527</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The great shrinking of the middle class that has captured the attention of the nation is not only\u00a0playing out in troubled regions like the Rust Belt, Appalachia and the Deep South, but in just about every metropolitan area\u00a0in America, according to a major new analysis by the Pew Research Center.

But while much of the attention has focused on communities hardest hit by economic declines, the new Pew data, based on metro-level income data since 2000, show that middle-class stagnation is\u00a0a far broader phenomenon.</p>\n<p>The share of adults living in middle-income households has also dwindled in Washington, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta and Denver.

It's withering\u00a0in coastal tech hubs, in military towns,\u00a0in college communities, in Sun Belt cities.</p>\n<p>The decline of the American middle class is \"a pervasive local phenomenon,\" according to Pew, which analyzed census and American Community Survey data in 229 metros across the country, encompassing about three-quarters of the U.S. population. In 203 of those metros, the share of adults in middle-income households fell from 2000 to 2014.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-185546\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/05/middle-income_1024.png\" alt=\"middle-income_1024\" width=\"731\" height=\"1024\" /></p>\n<p>Pew defines middle-income households here as those making between two-thirds and twice the national median household income. For a three-person household in 2014, that means an income between about $42,000 and $125,000. \u00a0The fact that median incomes have declined over this same time frame also means that the bar to get into the middle class is actually lower now than it was in 2000. Pew's\u00a0metro-level\u00a0data are also adjusted for household size and local cost of living.</p>\n<p>The shrinking middle class is in part a reflection\u00a0of rising income inequality in America, and of the same underlying and uneven economic forces\u00a0that have fueled the rise of Donald Trump. And as\u00a0the middle class has been shrinking, median incomes have fallen, too. In 190 of these 229 metros, the median income dropped\u00a0over this same time.</p>\n<p>As the middle class has shrunk, Pew points out, the lower and upper classes in America have grown in size and significance.\u00a0In some metros,\u00a0the middle class is dwindling primarily\u00a0because families are falling out of it and into the lower class. The share of households in this bottom tier has skyrocketed since 2000, for instance, in Goldbsoro, North Carolina, a railroad junction with an Air Force base.</p>\n<p>But in other places, the\u00a0shrinking middle class is actually a sign of economic gains, as more people who were once middle class have joined the ranks at the top. This has been the case in booming energy hubs like Midland,\u00a0Texas.</p>\n<p>In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the share of adults living in lower-income households has actually held steady over this time. The households\u00a0disappearing from the middle-class, rather, are reflected in the growing numbers at the top (this does not mean, though, that the same middle-class families are necessarily becoming wealthier; changes in the population makeup of the region may also reflect who moves away from the area\u00a0and who migrates in).</p>\n<p>In total, 172 of these 229 metros saw a growing share of households in the upper-income tier. About as many \u2014 160 \u2014 saw a growing share at the bottom. And 108 experienced both: The middle class shrank as the ranks of both the poor and the rich grew.</p>\n<p>The places with greatest net economic losses \u2014 where the shrinking middle-class has meant a sizable influx of households among the poor\u00a0\u2014 are metro areas that have historically relied heavily on manufacturing, like Detroit, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Springfield, Ohio.</p>\n<p>In only about a quarter of all of these metros does the middle class make up less than a majority of the adult population today. But the largest metros in the country fall into this group, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington. In each of these metros, the middle class is relatively small because the upper-class share of the population is larger than average.</p>\n<p>These same metros also tend to have wider income inequality, reflecting the broad spectrum of jobs in industries from the low-paying service sector to finance and biotech.\u00a0As a result, not surprisingly, Pew's data shows that metros with greater income inequality tend to have smaller middle classes. When the income distribution is narrower, on the other hand, more people are likely to be clustered in that middle tier between $42,000 and $125,000.</p>\n<div class=\"flex-embed\">\n<div class=\"posttv-video-embed wpv-player\" data-uuid=\"da02e028-87a2-11e4-abcf-5a3d7b3b20b8\" data-object-id=\"54945d8de4b0e7b7e108130d\" data-youtube-id=\"UBamPFjk27E\" data-is-truth-teller=\"0\" data-max-width=\"500\" data-max-height=\"750\" data-show-endscreen=\"1\" data-show-promo=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/thumbnails/20141219/54945d8de4b0e7b7e108130d/20141219_liftoff_economy.jpg\" data-headline=\"Liftoff &amp; Letdown: What's wrong with the economy\" data-duration=\"152000\" data-category-id=\"segments\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-video-360=\"0\" data-variants=\"0\" ><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//js.washingtonpost.com/video/resources/env/WapoVideo/dist/WapoVideoEmbed.min.js\"></script></div>\n</div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/the-middle-class-is-shrinking-just-about-everywhere-in-america/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>&#8216;I had to wear Pampers\u2019: The cruel reality the people who bring you cheap chicken allegedly endure</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/i-had-to-wear-pampers-many-poultry-industry-workers-allegedly-cant-even-take-bathroom-breaks/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/i-had-to-wear-pampers-many-poultry-industry-workers-allegedly-cant-even-take-bathroom-breaks/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 17:39:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Roberto A.

In some cases, according to the group, the reality is so oppressive that workers \"urinate and defecate while standing on the line\" and \"wear diapers to work.\" In others, employees say they avoid drinking liquids for long periods and endure considerable pain in order to keep their jobs.</p>\n<p>The findings are the result of\u00a0hundreds of interviews\u00a0with line workers from some of the largest poultry processing companies in the United States, including Tyson Foods, Pilgrim's, and Perdue. And they bring the current state of the poultry industry into serious question. Competitive forces, they suggest, are\u00a0driving\u00a0poultry processors to produce as much meat as possible, as fast as possible, leading companies to mistreat their workers, even if unknowingly.</p>\n<p>Today, poultry processing plants are allowed to funnel chickens through their assembly lines at a rate of 140 birds per minute, a rate which the industry recently\u00a0lobbied\u00a0to increase by another 35 birds per minute. The speed has been great for business, but for those working on the line, it has made for\u00a0extremely\u00a0taxing shifts. Just ask\u00a0Debbie Berkowitz, a senior fellow at the National Employment Law Project who used to work with the government agency that oversaw industry practices. On Wednesday, she published\u00a0<a href=\"http://qz.com/681025/big-poultry-workers-are-literally-peeing-their-pants-so-that-americans-can-have-cheap-chicken/\" target=\"_blank\">a piece</a> in response\u00a0to the new report. This is how she described the conditions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In my work at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, I witnessed the dangers: poultry workers stand shoulder to shoulder on both sides of long conveyor belts, most using scissors or knives, in cold, damp, loud conditions, making the same forceful movements thousands upon thousands of times a day, as they skin, pull, cut, debone and pack the chickens. The typical plant processes 180,000 birds a day. A typical worker handles 40 birds a minute.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By law, companies are required to grant their employees access to bathrooms. A <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&amp;p_id=22932\" target=\"_blank\">set of standards</a>, written\u00a0by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1998, makes clear that facilities must be available to employees\u00a0upon\u00a0need. In response, the industry has instituted a system, whereby extra workers are available to swap in in the case someone has to leave the line to use the restroom, a system which the government supports so long as\u00a0\"there are sufficient relief workers to assure that employees need not wait an unreasonably long time to use the bathroom.\"</p>\n<p>But the system is either flawed or being eschewed by supervisors, according to Oxfam. Workers reported waiting for more than an hour for someone to swap in, if anyone came at all. Many of them said\u00a0they were forced to urinate or defecate where they stood or leave the line without permission, because no help arrived. At some plants, workers have come\u00a0to expect no relief,\u00a0leading them\u00a0to take\u00a0embarrassing measures\u00a0to withstand the conditions.</p>\n<p>\"I had to wear Pampers. I and many, many others had to wear Pampers,\" one worker told Oxfam, an admission the organization found to be surprisingly common.</p>\n<p>The industry has responded with both concern and denial. Oxfam says it reached out to all of the companies mentioned in the report, but only heard back from two: Tyson Foods and Perdue. Both said they don't tolerate the sort of practices mentioned in the report, and cited steps they have taken to make sure working conditions at their processing plants are safe and humane. But only one, Tyson, acknowledged the possibility that\u00a0there were slip-ups happening under their watch.</p>\n<p>Gary Mickelson, the senior director of public relations for Tyson Foods, expressed consternation in a follow up e-mail about the report. \"We're concerned about these anonymous claims and while we currently have no evidence they're true, are checking to make sure our position on restroom breaks is being followed and our Team Members' needs are being met.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mickelson said he has\u00a0met with officials of Oxfam America in the past to talk about\u00a0their concerns. \"We\u2019ve told them that while we believe we\u2019re a caring, responsible company, we\u2019re always willing to consider ways we can do better,\" he said in an e-mail. \"We do not tolerate the refusal of requests to use the restroom.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Perdue, on the other hand, didn't leave open the possibility that its workers were being subjected to the conditions cited in the report. Julie DeYoung, a company spokesperson, said an internal revenue failed to corroborate Oxfam's findings, citing the company's policy, which allows line workers to take two 30-minute bathroom breaks over the course of an eight hour shift.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"If a department is short-staffed that day, there may be times it is difficult to provide immediate coverage,\" DeYoung said in an e-mail. \"If an associate has a health or other reason why they need more frequent restroom breaks, they can visit the onsite Wellness Center for support services or talk with Human Resources to request an accommodation for their condition.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The concerns raised in the Oxfam report are the latest in a string of evidence that suggests those who work to\u00a0ensure that chicken is both widely and cheaply available endure harsh treatment and face grueling conditions. <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Unsafe_at_These_Speeds_web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A 2013 report</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that nearly\u00a080 percent of 266 workers surveyed in Alabama said they were not allowed to use the bathroom when they needed to. <a href=\"http://www.mygmwc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Striving-for-a-Just-and-Safer-Workplace-Final-04262016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Another report</a>, published just last month, found that 86 percent of workers surveyed in Minnesota said they received fewer than two bathroom breaks each week.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Asked whether video footage, which is often available in plants, might help to show whether workers were actually being allowed to leave the line to use the bathroom,\u00a0Mickelson, the Tyson spokesperson, said such\u00a0monitoring is available in some parts of the company's plants. DeYoung, the Perdue spokesperson, didn't respond to the question.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/i-had-to-wear-pampers-many-poultry-industry-workers-allegedly-cant-even-take-bathroom-breaks/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Donald Trump has discovered one weird trick for getting people to agree with him</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/donald-trump-has-discovered-one-weird-trick-for-getting-people-to-agree-with-him/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/donald-trump-has-discovered-one-weird-trick-for-getting-people-to-agree-with-him/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 15:51:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt O'Brien]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/?p=185173</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Donald Trump has discovered one weird trick for getting everyone to agree with him half\u00a0the time.

That's taking both sides of every issue.</p>\n<p>Or at least appearing to.</p>\n<p>Trump, you see, doesn't so much seem to have firm\u00a0positions as he has words that have come\u00a0out of his mouth more recently than other words. Sometimes the new words mean the same thing as the old ones. Other times they don't.\u00a0So which ones does Trump \"really\" believe? Who knows. Perhaps with the exception of Mexico paying for a wall at our southern border, it's not even clear he does. The answer might be whatever he thinks will help him the most.</p>\n<p>And no, that's not hyperbole. Just look at all the positions he's taken on all the biggest issues there are.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Taxes</strong>. Trump was for raising taxes on the rich before he was against before he was for it again before he was ... against it again? I think that's the right number of \"fors\" and \"againsts.\" Trump started out by saying he wanted to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-26/donald-trump-says-he-wants-to-raise-taxes-on-himself\" target=\"_blank\">raise taxes on people like himself</a>, and especially on hedge fund managers who, thanks to maybe the most egregious loophole of them all, only pay taxes at the 23.8 percent capital gains rate instead of the 39.6 percent ordinary income one. So the next thing he did, of course, was put together a plan that, according to the nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000560-an-analysis-of-donald-trumps-tax-plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Policy Center</a>, would cut taxes for the top 0.1 percent -- that's the richest of the richest -- by $1.3 million a year.</p>\n<p>That was his position as long as the primaries were going on. Now that he is eyeing the general election, though, he <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/donald-trump-flip-flops-taxes-wages-he-turns-focus-general-election\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that he was \"not necessarily a huge fan\" of his own plan, and that, over the course of a negotiation, he could actually see the top tax rate going up. Or did he? He, well,\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/08/politics/donald-trump-taxes-wealthy/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">clarified</a></em>\u00a0a day later that he was only talking about the top tax rate going up compared to how low he wants it to be, not compared to how high it already is. And now there are <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-taxes-tax-reform-223041\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> he's asked Republican economists to do just that.\u00a0In other words, President Trump would give the super-rich a tax cut somewhere between $1 million and $1.3 million.\u00a0Good of him to narrow that down.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The debt</strong>. Trump originally said he'd <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-turmoil-or-triumph-donald-trump-stands-alone/2016/04/02/8c0619b6-f8d6-11e5-a3ce-f06b5ba21f33_story.html?tid=a_inl\" target=\"_blank\">pay off the entire $19 trillion national debt</a> in eight years. Never mind that\u00a0the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that over this time his tax cuts would only leave him with $25 trillion of revenue to pay for the $21 trillion of Social Security, Medicare, and defense spending he says he will never cut.\u00a0Which, with a little subtraction, means that he'd come up\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/05/donald-trump-is-just-paul-ryan-on-steroids/\" target=\"_blank\">$15 trillion short</a> of eliminating all the debt even if he eliminated all the federal government other than those three big programs.\u00a0Nobody said math was going to be part of making America great again.</p>\n<p>It's not exactly a surprise, then, that Trump has backtracked on all this. \"I'd rather not be all that aggressive\" about paying down the debt, he <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/19/donald-trump-yellen-fed-debt/\" target=\"_blank\">told Fortune</a>\u00a0just a few weeks after he said he'd pay it all down. \"I'm the king of debt,\" he went on\u00a0<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/05/investing/trump-king-of-debt-fire-janet-yellen/\" target=\"_blank\">to say</a>. \"I love debt.\"</p>\n<p><strong>3. Paying the debt at all</strong>. For the first 227 years of our government's history, we have made a point to pay all our debts. And\u00a0with a few <a href=\"http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/the-u-s-has-defaulted-before/\" target=\"_blank\">exceptions</a>, we have. That, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/opinion/in-hamiltons-debt.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Hamilton</a> hoped, has allowed us to borrow on better terms than we otherwise could, and made people trust our debt so much that it's become a kind of money itself.</p>\n<p>But Trump sure <em>seemed</em> willing to throw that all away when he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/us/politics/donald-trumps-idea-to-cut-national-debt-get-creditors-to-accept-less.html?ref=topics\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> that he'd \"borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.\" That, after all, is how he has run his casinos. He'd take big risks with other people's money, and if those risks didn't pan out, he'd get them to take less money than they'd been promised. The problem, though, with running the U.S. government this way is that it would turn the safest asset in the world into something less so, and, in turn, destroy bank balance sheets even more than the 2008 crisis.</p>\n<p>So Trump quickly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/09/donald-trumps-bizarre-explanation-of-how-the-national-debt-works/\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> that he only meant he might buy back some of our bonds if interest rates rose, which probably <a href=\"http://cepr.net/blogs/beat-the-press/did-donald-trump-get-the-story-on-buying-back-debt-at-a-discount-right\" target=\"_blank\">wouldn't save money</a>, but at least wouldn't be the end of the world as we knew it. And just to make sure that people understood he wasn't advocating a default,\u00a0he (correctly) <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-no-debt-default-222957\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out</a> that the U.S. government would \"never have to default, because you print the money.\" Even that, though, sounded a little too insouciant, so he came back and said that the government's bonds are \"<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-reiterates-call-for-big-tax-cuts-1462826682\" target=\"_blank\">absolutely sacred</a>.\"</p>\n<p><strong>4. The Federal Reserve</strong>. Primary Trump <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-10-16/trump-speaks-in-bloomberg-tv-interview-on-janet-yellen-interest-rates\" target=\"_blank\">thought</a> it was \"a political thing, keeping these interest rates at this level.\" But now General Election Trump <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/low-interest-rate-trump-wants-to-replace-yellen-refinance-us-debt-2016-05-05\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> that he's a \"low interest rate person\" himself. Indeed, he <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/19/donald-trump-yellen-fed-debt/\" target=\"_blank\">thinks</a> low rates are \"the best thing we have going for us\" today, since they make it cheaper to pay back the debt and invest in infrastructure. The only thing that could change this calculus, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/upshot/donald-trump-is-coherent-on-monetary-policy-but-not-on-debt.html\" target=\"_blank\">he says</a>, is \"if inflation starts coming, and we don't see any signs of that ... [then] you'd have to go up and you have to slow things down.\" That's actually a well-reasoned argument the Fed has been making itself.</p>\n<p><strong>5. The minimum wage</strong>. First, Trump <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2015/11/10/donald-trump-says-dont-raise-minimum-wage-but-massachusetts-lawmakers-disagree\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he didn't want to raise the minimum wage at all, since it was already \"too high\" and \"we're not going to be able to compete against the rest of the world\" if it got any higher. Then he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/04/donald-trump-says-hes-open-to-doing-something-on-minimum-wage/\" target=\"_blank\">proclaimed</a> that he was \"actually very different from other Republicans\" and would be \"open to doing something\" about the minimum wage. Finally, though, he <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-may-8-2016-n570111\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> that while he hoped states would raise their own minimum wages, he didn't think the federal government should have one at all. So, for those keeping score at home, he's wanted to keep the minimum wage where it is, raise it, and \u2014 as of right now \u2014 get rid of it.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Immigration</strong>.

What do I mean by that? Well, other than cutting taxes for the rich, Republicans have stopped being for things as much as they are just against whatever Democrats are for \u2014 even if Democrats are for things that Republicans used to be for. Obama has a stimulus that's $72 billion bigger than the one House Republicans <a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2012/08/14/paul-ryan-and-the-stimulus-a-match-designed-to-make-my-head-explode/\" target=\"_blank\">voted for</a>? Socialism. Obama took Mitt Romney's health-care plan to the rest of the country? Unconstitutional socialism. Obama wants to implement the kind of cap-and-trade system John McCain ran on? An economy-killing tax. Or, best of all, Obama offers to cut Social Security the way Republicans have demanded? He's throwing <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/social-security-republicans-and-post-p\" target=\"_blank\">seniors under the bus</a>.</p>\n<p>It's all about affect. All about opposing.\u00a0Even if he's proposing policies that Republicans used to. That's irrelevant. It's politics as a battle of tribes, not ideas. And that's why Trump has been able to do so well at the same time that he hasn't done so well on the whole agenda thing. \"He doesn't want to waste time on policy,\" one person reportedly familiar with Trump's thinking <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-administration-transition-222944\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, according to Politico, and will wait \"until after he is elected but before he's inaugurated\" to \"figure out what exactly he is going to do.\" But, again, that doesn't matter as far as Republican voters are concerned. All that matters is that he's gotten the most important thing right.</p>\n<p>That's letting them know that he's on <em>their</em> side, not Obama's.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/donald-trump-has-discovered-one-weird-trick-for-getting-people-to-agree-with-him/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>How badly companies misunderstand millennials</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/how-badly-companies-misunderstand-millennials/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2016/05/11/how-badly-companies-misunderstand-millennials/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 15:26:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Niraj Chokshi]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Demographics]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/?p=185377</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Working millennials ask\u00a0a lot\u00a0of\u00a0their employers, but game rooms and rock walls are low on the list.

Sanders said the\u00a0legislation had doubled extreme poverty, creating\u00a0hardship for millions of Americans.\u00a0 \u201cWhat welfare reform did, in my view, was to go after some of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/27/bernie-sanders-is-right-bill-clintons-welfare-law-doubled-extreme-poverty/\">he said in South Carolina</a> in February.</p>\n<p>Sanders\u00a0did not continue to<strong>\u00a0</strong>press the issue, however, and while he has campaigned as a champion of the downtrodden\u00a0and a nemesis of inequality, Sanders has not proposed many policies that would directly address\u00a0the law\u2019s negative consequences, such as\u00a0an expansion of the food-stamp program or\u00a0a tax credit that can be converted to cash. Now that\u00a0his presidential campaign may be\u00a0drawing to a close,\u00a0some on the left are disappointed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0unfortunate that Sanders didn\u2019t put anything on the table,\u201d said economist Dean Baker, a director\u00a0of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research.</p>\n<p>In the years before Clinton's reforms passed with bipartisan support, Baker recalled, the debate often devolved into stereotypes. \u201cThe idea was, \u2018We can\u2019t be associated with these people who are lazy good-for-nothings,\u2019 and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gone away,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Sanders, probably like everyone else, is scared of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanders\u2019s policy director, Warren Gunnels, objected in an interview to the suggestion that\u00a0the senator should have focused more\u00a0on\u00a0poverty, calling it \u201cpreposterous\u00a0and absurd.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanders \u201cis doing everything he can in this campaign to lift millions of Americans out of poverty and into the middle class,\u201d Gunnels said. He pointed\u00a0to Sanders\u2019s proposal for national health insurance, an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and\u00a0a major investment in infrastructure, which he said would put more Americans to work and ensure that\u00a0they earn a living wage.</p>\n<h3>\u2018He has not suggested anything\u2019</h3>\n<p>Sanders\u2019s overall philosophy is to tax the rich more heavily to provide more benefits for all. The costliest\u00a0benefits\u00a0would come from\u00a0establishing\u00a0a government-run universal health-insurance program\u00a0and\u00a0eliminating tuition at public colleges and universities.</p>\n<p>Yet these initiatives would not radically change the lives of the country\u2019s poorest people. Many poor Americans already qualify for Medicaid. Higher education\u00a0is a distant dream for many of them.\u00a0Likewise, doubling the minimum wage would only help\u00a0those who already have\u00a0a job.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://The economist who vouched for Bernie Sanders\u2019 big liberal plans is voting for Hillary Clinton\">Economists who support Sanders\u2019s proposals</a> generally argue that a major increase in federal borrowing\u00a0would stimulate an economy that seems persistently weak, putting more people to work and increasing national income.</p>\n<p>When President Clinton was in office, the economy was expanding rapidly and poverty declined.\u00a0Sanders\u2019s spending could replicate\u00a0those conditions \u2014 for example, he proposes\u00a0an additional $1 trillion on\u00a0repairing and maintaining physical infrastructure, which his campaign says would\u00a0employ 13 million people.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some on the left say this\u00a0logic\u00a0just repeats what they see as the\u00a0error\u00a0of\u00a0Clinton\u2019s approach to poverty. The president\u2019s policies ignored those who cannot work, whether\u00a0due to a disability or because they have to care for young children or relatives who are sick, said\u00a0Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland\u00a0who has advocated for more generous family benefits.</p>\n<p>Cohen said that\u00a0focusing benefits on poor people who work is\u00a0easier politically, since opponents can accuse those without a steady job of laziness. \u201cIf you say what you\u2019re doing is for working families, nobody who votes objects to that,\u201d he\u00a0said. This focus \u201chas shifted assistance to people who are just barely poor and not the seriously poor,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>Before the 1996 law, welfare beneficiaries weren\u2019t required to work to receive checks from the government. Critics said the system\u00a0created\u00a0dependency and discouraged\u00a0people from working.<strong>\u00a0</strong>Under Clinton\u2019s\u00a0reforms, beneficiaries\u00a0had to work or participate in\u00a0various kinds of employment-related activities, such as\u00a0vocational training, to continue receiving benefits.</p>\n<p>Together with his\u00a0expansion of a major tax credit that\u00a0increases in value as a\u00a0worker\u2019s wages increase up to\u00a0a certain level, Clinton\u2019s\u00a0policies\u00a0were a boon for the working poor, said Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, her research suggests that\u00a0those who could not get\u00a0steady\u00a0work\u00a0received\u00a0less help as the law took effect. Edin and\u00a0the University of Michigan\u2019s Luke Shaefer\u00a0found\u00a0that the number of\u00a0households living in extreme poverty in any given year \u2014 which they define\u00a0less than $2 in cash a\u00a0day \u2014 has roughly doubled.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-177009\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/02/Edin-and-Shaefer-SIPP.jpg\" alt=\"Edin and Shaefer SIPP\" width=\"2300\" height=\"1905\" /></p>\n<p>Sanders voted against Clinton\u2019s\u00a0reform.

He has not suggested anything to mend the safety net.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Medicare for all and more</h3>\n<p>Family leave, another plank in Sanders\u2019s\u00a0platform, would largely\u00a0benefit people with jobs. Since the poorest one in five\u00a0households are less likely to have steady employment,\u00a0Sanders\u2019s\u00a0family-leave proposal would be worth just $7 a year to families in this group on average, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/27/bernie-sanders-is-right-bill-clintons-welfare-law-doubled-extreme-poverty/\">an analysis</a> published by the nonpartisan\u00a0Tax Policy Center on Monday.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-185326\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/05/2300-16.jpg\" alt=\"2300 (16)\" width=\"2300\" height=\"1756\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gunnels, the candidate\u2019s\u00a0policy director, pointed to other policies that would help people who\u00a0cannot work, such as Sanders\u2019s call\u00a0for an additional $5 billion dedicated to\u00a0public housing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe best way to make sure that Americans are lifted out of poverty is to make sure that millions of Americans have jobs, jobs that pay a living wage \u2014 and that we also do help out the most vulnerable Americans,\u201d Gunnels said.</p>\n<p>Sanders\u2019s proposal for a national health-insurance\u00a0system would also offer\u00a0generous\u00a0benefits for some poor people who aren\u2019t working.\u00a0The government would pay for long-term care for those who need it\u00a0due to disability or age. Among\u00a0the poorest one in five U.S. households, the value of this benefit would average about $1,300 a year, according to the Tax Policy Center. Of course, many of those households wouldn\u2019t need this\u00a0benefit, and the actual value\u00a0would be far\u00a0more for the households that would\u00a0use\u00a0it.</p>\n<p class=\"interstitial-link\" channel=\"wp.com\">\n  <i>\n    [<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/09/the-17-trillion-problem-with-bernie-sanderss-health-care-plan-2/\">Sorry, Bernie fans.

Many poor and middle-class families already receive help from the federal government in obtaining\u00a0health insurance, whether through Medicaid or through the subsidies\u00a0on insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act,\u00a0President Obama\u2019s health-care legislation. Sanders\u2019s new system would replace those benefits.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-185327\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/05/2300-17.jpg\" alt=\"2300 (17)\" width=\"2300\" height=\"1756\" />The same is true of Sanders\u2019s proposal to\u00a0pay for tuition at public colleges and universities. Since children in more affluent families are more likely to graduate from high school and apply to costly four-year degrees, these families would be more likely to benefit.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-185328\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/05/2300-18.jpg\" alt=\"2300 (18)\" width=\"2300\" height=\"1675\" /></p>\n<p>To be sure, federal health insurance and tuition grants could be priceless for those poor families that do benefit from them.\u00a0In total, though,\u00a0the richest one in five households would receive about twice as much\u00a0on average as the poorest one in five would under Sanders\u2019s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center.</p>\n<h3>Sanders's\u00a0vision</h3>\n<p>When it comes to poverty, Sanders\u2019s vision for the United States contrasts with the northern European democracies he\u00a0often\u00a0points to as\u00a0exemplars.\u00a0In those places,\u00a0governments shield residents\u00a0from extreme hardship,\u00a0said Lane Kenworthy, a sociologist at the University of California-San Diego.</p>\n<p>In some places, such as <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=9025&amp;langId=en\">Denmark</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=9044&amp;langId=en\">Sweden</a>,\u00a0citizens and sometimes\u00a0immigrants who can\u2019t support themselves are guaranteed a minimum income. Other countries, such as the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=9045&amp;langId=en\">United Kingdom</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=9028&amp;langId=en\">France</a>, use a combination of tax credits, housing allowances and other benefits to\u00a0achieve the same goal.</p>\n<p>Kenworthy cited\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.sofi.su.se/spin/data/description-of-datasets/social-assistance-and-minimum-income-protection-interim-dataset-samip\">data</a> showing that people in Finland, Germany and Denmark are guaranteed incomes in excess of $20,000 annually. In the United States, the equivalent figure is below $10,000, including housing, public assistance and tax credits that can be refunded in cash (not just used to pay\u00a0taxes).</p>\n<p>These schemes\u00a0aren\u2019t\u00a0perfect \u2014 as in the United States, some Europeans don't benefit from them, perhaps because they can\u2019t meet certain requirements imposed on beneficiaries or simply because they are unaware of what they are entitled to. Where these programs\u00a0are available,\u00a0though,\u00a0they seem to\u00a0help reduce dire\u00a0poverty.</p>\n<p>About 0.2 percent of the French population was living on less than $2.15 per person per day in 2008, according to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=6462&amp;langId=en\">an E.U. report</a>. Edin and Shaefer\u2019s estimates suggest that\u00a0something more like 1 percent of the U.S. population is living on less than $2 per household per day, an even more extreme measure.</p>\n<p>Because\u00a0this subject\u00a0is so politically fraught in this country, Kenworthy said\u00a0he doesn\u2019t blame Sanders for avoiding\u00a0it during the campaign.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey, basically, are okay\u00a0with insuring that people at the bottom have a decent income,\u201d Kenworthy said of the Europeans. \u201cThat\u2019s just proved so contentious over time in the United States. Even somebody as progressive as Bernie Sanders hasn\u2019t been willing to put that on the table, precisely because it\u2019s so contentious.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_172102\" style=\"width: 918px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-172102 size-full\" src=\"http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/19/Foreign/Images/505559492.jpg\" alt=\"COLUMBIA, SC - JANUARY 18:  Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
