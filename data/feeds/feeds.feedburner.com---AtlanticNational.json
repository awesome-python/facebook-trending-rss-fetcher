As Peake notes, the left side of this photo is north, and Manhattan is the island in the middle. That big green rectangle is Central Park, of course, but the city\u2019s iconic buildings are hardly visible. At this distance, the city of 8.4 million people looks to me like nothing so much as the lichens I found growing on rocks and tree bark while hiking with my family back in the Pacific Northwest\u2014a very different environment from the paved and polished city I now know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, for a city like New York, lichens are a fitting metaphor. They\u2019re composite organisms, as &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen\"&gt;Wikipedia explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A lichen \u2026 arises from algae or &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria\" title=\"Cyanobacteria\"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt; (or both) living among filaments of a fungus in a symbiotic relationship. The combined life form has properties that are very different from the properties of its component organisms. \u2026 Lichens are abundant growing on bark, leaves, mosses, on other lichens, and hanging from branches \u201cliving on thin air\u201d ... They grow on bare rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, exposed soil surfaces, and in the soil as part of a &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_soil_crust\" title=\"Biological soil crust\"&gt;biological soil crust&lt;/a&gt;. Different kinds of lichens have adapted to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. \u2026 They are relatively self-contained miniature ecosystems in and of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s New York to me: an ecosystem made up of overlapping life forms, something greater than the sum of its parts and its people. It\u2019s the harshest place I\u2019ve ever been, and also the most fertile. When I came to New York for college, like so many people before me, I was thrilled by the city\u2019s crowds and constant activity, and also overwhelmed by them. I felt small, anonymous, insignificant, invisible. And I felt alive, swept up in the bloodstream of something greater than myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe lichens are the consummate New Yorkers\u2014unassuming, abundant, tenacious. Above all, they survive, and they transform themselves and each other. They are, as poet Jane Hirshfield writes in our &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/04/for-the-lichens/308411/?utm_source=feed\"&gt;April 2011 issue&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;chemists of air,&lt;br&gt;\r\nchangers of nitrogen-unusable into nitrogen-usable. \u2026&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Transformers unvalued, uncounted.&lt;br&gt;\r\nCell by cell, word by word, making a world they could live in.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(See all Orbital Views &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/category/orbital-view/?utm_source=feed\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticNational/~4/TtZf2ENJ3RE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><author><name>Rosa Inocencio Smith</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/rosa-smith/</uri></author><title type=\"html\">Orbital View: A Great Place to Feel Small</title><link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticNational/~3/TtZf2ENJ3RE/\" rel=\"alternate\" /><published>2016-05-12T17:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-05-12T17:01:32-04:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2016:374-482568</id><summary type=\"html\">I &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/05/orbital-view-city-of-roses/481215/\"&gt;recently wrote about&lt;/a&gt; my hometown, Portland, Oregon.

Both women requested the jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe Corps applauds the time and efforts of those Marines who volunteered,\u201d said Captain Philip Kulczewski, a Marine spokesman at the Pentagon. More from &lt;em&gt;The Military Times:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Since no women have graduated from the service\u2019s Infantry Officer Course, female Marine or Navy officers assigned to infantry battalions will serve in support roles. The 30th female Marine to attempt IOC left her class on April 21 after she was unable to complete two hikes. She has the opportunity to attempt the course again in July.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marines did not release the women\u2019s names. Under the service\u2019s gender-integration policy, two female officers will be assigned to the infantry unit 90 days before its new members arrive. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/12/women-in-the-military/418680/?utm_source=feed\"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in December it would open all combat jobs in every branch of the armed forces to women starting this year. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to serve as Army Rangers and Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers, and everything else that was previously open only to men,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carter &lt;a href=\"http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/story/military/2016/04/15/first-female-marine-applies-join-infantry/83073068/\"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the Marine Corps\u2019 gender integration plan in March, making 233 women who graduated from infantry training and other military occupational-specialty schools eligible to apply for combat jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military will see several firsts for female service members this year. The Army &lt;a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/15/army-women-new-rules-infantry-armor-officers/83036812/\"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last month that 22 women would be commissioned as infantry and armor officers for the first time.

Our &lt;a href=\"http://www.gunbroker.com/User/SiteRules.aspx\" target=\"_Blank\"&gt;site rules&lt;/a&gt; state that we reserve the right to reject listings at our sole discretion, and have done so with the Zimmerman listing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;We want no part in the listing on our web site or in any of the publicity it is receiving.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site now listing it is United Gun Group, &lt;a href=\"http://www.unitedgungroup.com/auction/detail/auction/9/slug/george-zimmerman-s-gun-used-2-26-12\"&gt;but that website appears to be down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Unitedgungroup/?pnref=lhc\"&gt;In a statement on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, that website said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;United Gun Group offers a free platform for law-abiding citizens to buy, sell, trade and discuss firearms and related products. United Gun Group\u2019s stance is that as long as Mr. Zimmerman (or any other UGG member) is obeying the letter of the law, his personal firearm sale will be permitted on our network. \u2026 He appears to be following all applicable laws.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman, the neighborhood-watch volunteer, was acquitted of murder in the 2012 shooting death of Martin, a black 17-year-old, in Sanford, Florida. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the Gunbroker.com posting when it was still online:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Prospective bidders, I am honored and humbled to announce the sale of an American Firearm Icon. The firearm for sale is the firearm that was used to defend my life and end the brutal attack from Trayvon Martin on 2/26/2012. \u2026 Many have expressed interest in owning and displaying the firearm including The Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C. This is a piece of American History.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gun, Zimmerman says, was recently returned to him by the U.S. Department of Justice. He said he hopes to get at least $5,000 for the weapon, and a portion of the proceeds \u201c&lt;span&gt;will be used to: fight BLM violence against Law Enforcement officers, ensure the demise of\u201d Angela Corey\u2019s career as a prosecutor, \u201cand Hillary Clinton\u2019s anti-firearm rhetoric.\u201d His posting ends with the words \u201c&lt;/span&gt;Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum,\u201d a Latin phrase that means \u201cif you want peace, prepare for war.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLM refers to the Black Lives Matter movement, which sprung up following several high-profile incidents in which white police officers killed unarmed black men. Corey is the Florida State Attorney who failed in her attempt to prosecute Zimmerman for killing Martin. She is up for re-election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian, &lt;a href=\"http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/statement-smithsonian-george-zimmerman-s-firearm\"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, denied it had expressed interest in the weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian has never expressed interest in collecting George Zimmerman\u2019s firearm. The Smithsonian has no plans to ever collect or display this object in any of its museums.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned auction of the weapon prompted criticism Thursday. Indeed, Zimmerman &lt;a href=\"http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/140127772-story\"&gt;told WOFL-TV&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando, Florida, he\u2019d received several death threats after putting the gun up for sale. \u201cWhat I've decided to do is not cower,\u201d he said. I\u2019m \u201ca free American. I can do what I want with my possessions.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin was walking to his father\u2019s home in 2012 when he was shot and killed by Zimmerman inside a gated community. The neighborhood-watch volunteer said he felt threatened by the 17-year-old and successfully argued in court that his actions were protected by Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since that time, Zimmerman has been charged with assault following complaints from two girlfriends, who subsequently declined to cooperate with police, leading to the charges being dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction for his weapon was set to begin at 11 a.m. EDT Thursday and end 24 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the planned sale, Daryl Parks, an attorney for Martin\u2019s family, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/05/12/trayvon-martin-family-attorney-george-zimmerman-gun-auction-insulting-and-disrespectful/?tid=sm_tw\"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: \u201cIt is insulting to this family that he would decided that he would sell the gun that he killed their child with.

They also include reduced restrictions regarding mandatory water rationing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of California\u2019s largest reservoirs have filled to 90 percent capacity, and this winter El Ni\u00f1o dropped plenty of snow in the mountains and helped the northern half of the state recover from years of record-low precipitation. But while some parts of California have returned to more regular rainfall, &lt;a href=\"http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?CA\"&gt;90 percent of the state&lt;/a&gt; remains in a drought. Recognizing those differences, the State Water Resources Control Board also proposed Monday that each water district be allowed to set its own conservation limits. That change will be considered May 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-water-conservation-20160509-story.html\"&gt;explains &lt;/a&gt;the shifting drought situation in recent years:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As the drought intensified, Brown last year ordered a statewide 25% cut in urban water use, the first mandate of its kind in California history. To achieve that, the water board set individual targets for communities. Those with the highest per-capita use were ordered to reduce water consumption by as much as 36%.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, the state\u2019s overall urban use has dropped nearly 24% compared with 2013.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;But water agencies up and down the state complained that the conservation targets didn\u2019t take into account regional climate differences, previous conservation efforts or alternative supplies such as desalinated seawater.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the State Water Resources Control Board is planning on a much drier California in the next century. While a state law from 2009 already requires a 20 percent drop in per capita water use, officials are planning to push that number even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticNational/~4/1Q4L7fmDmC8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><author><name>J.

Congress approved the bipartisan bison legislation last month. The U.S. Department of the Interior &lt;a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/blog/15-facts-about-our-national-mammal-american-bison\"&gt;recalled&lt;/a&gt; Monday the bison\u2019s tumultuous experience once the Europeans arrived on the continent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In prehistoric times, millions of bison roamed North America\u2014&lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/bisonbellow/january7.cfm\"&gt;from the forests of Alaska and the grasslands of Mexico to Nevada\u2019s Great Basin and the eastern Appalachian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. But by the late 1800s, there were only a few hundred bison left in the United States after European settlers pushed west, reducing the animal\u2019s habitat and hunting the bison to near extinction. Had it not been for a few private individuals working with tribes, states and the Interior Department, the bison would be extinct today.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Native Americans had long traveled beside the herds, using their meat, hide, and horns to survive. When European and American trappers started to travel west, they killed the animal for its fur. Bison hunting intensified in the 1860s, as railroads tied east to west and allowed people to reach once-desolate lands more easily. It brought people like William Cody, a U.S. Cavalry scout who earned the nickname \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d for killing 5,000 bison in just 18 months. At one point, the U.S. military killed any bison it encountered, assuming that if the animals were eradicated, so too would be the Native Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there are 500,000 bison in the U.S., and about 10,000 of those live on public land and are overseen by the Department of the Interior. They roam in 17 herds in 12 states. Yellowstone National Park, the only place in the country where bison have lived continually, is home to the largest herd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticNational/~4/pBXhs7zqtjs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><author><name>J.

In most states, a jury must make a unanimous decision to determine whether a death sentence is appropriate for an individual who is found guilty of a capital offense. In Florida, the jury played an advisory role, able only to offer a recommended sentence. The actual sentence would come from the judge in the case, who would independently weigh the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida\u2019s new law requires that at least 10 of 12 jury members agree on a death sentence. On Monday, a circuit court judge in Miami-Dade, Milton Hirsch, said in a ruling that the statute still misses the mark, and urged that unanimity be required to sentence someone to die:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We ask only that such decisions reflect the will of the many rather than the will of the few. But for the ultimate decisions made within the judicial branch of government\u2014guilty or not guilty, life or death\u2014majority rule is insufficient. We do ask, indeed we insist, that the decision of capital juries be, in some sense, perfect; for they are, in some sense, final. We ask, indeed we insist, that they reflect the will of all rather than the will of the few or even of the many. Only when the jury agrees to its verdict unanimously can we demand that society accept the verdict unanimously.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/files/pdf/20160509092842101.pdf\"&gt;In his ruling&lt;/a&gt;, Hirsch cited Andrew Cohen\u2019s April 2014 article in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;on Louisiana\u2019s &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/04/Louisiana/360726/?utm_source=feed\"&gt;non-unanimous jury verdicts&lt;/a&gt; in murder trials. He issued the ruling in the case of Karon Gaiter, who is awaiting trial for first-degree murder, &lt;a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/florida-judge-death-penalty-law-unconstitutional-38989386\"&gt;according to the AP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except for Alabama and Delaware, all 33 states that have the death penalty &lt;a href=\"http://www.eji.org/deathpenalty/override\"&gt;require a unanimous jury verdict&lt;/a&gt; to impose the death sentence. In those two states, judges can override juries\u2019 recommendations against a death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticNational/~4/NtikoUpl8C8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><author><name>Marina Koren</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/marina-koren/</uri></author><media:content url=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/05/AP_321284892763/lead_960.jpg\"><media:credit>David Goldman / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type=\"html\">The Legal Controversy Over Florida's Death Penalty</title><link href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticNational/~3/NtikoUpl8C8/\" rel=\"alternate\" /><published>2016-05-09T16:32:41-04:00</published><updated>2016-05-09T16:33:22-04:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2016:50-481902</id><summary type=\"html\">A circuit-court judge has ruled that newly introduced sentencing laws are unconstitutional.</summary><feedburner:origLink>http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/05/florida-death-penalty/481902/</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Bordered by the ocean to the west and Golden Gate Park to the north, the Sunset District is home to about 85,000 people:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-version=\"6\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\"padding:8px;\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFJAoNaLEoS/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;A photo posted by Anthony Quigley &#x1f4f8; (@anthonyquigley)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-08T09:11:52+00:00\" style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\"&gt;May 8, 2016 at 2:11am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.66667;\"&gt;Quigley quotes from a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://summitsf.com/neighborhoods/outer-sunset\" style=\"line-height: 1.66667;\"&gt;real-estate listing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.66667;\"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;[The Sunset] is one of San Francisco\u2019s most family-friendly neighborhoods, with sprawling blocks of quaint single-family abodes.
