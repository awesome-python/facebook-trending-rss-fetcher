This should not have been surprising, of course, since Desert Island Discs, particularly with Kirsty in charge, has a formula that helps get beneath the skin of its guests like no other interview programme. Hanks is typically great from the off, inevitably, but if you want to find the moment that killed me, it's around the 24 minute mark on the podcast, just after the theme from 2001 has played. Kirsty asks a gently probing question about Hanks' challenging childhood experiences, and after a slightly strangled \"Ahhhh,\" there's a surprisingly long pause. Has the feed cut out? No. Because then Hanks asks, \"What have you done to me?\" and although he's chuckling it's clear that he's also crying. Then, through the snotty nose of the weeper, comes the line that floored me. \"I've put far too much thought into this list.\"</p><p>This, right here, is not only what makes Desert Island Discs great. It's what makes Tom Hanks great. The man is basically the biggest movie star in the world. He has four movies out this year, and all of them, I suspect, will contain something of magic. Also, as a 37 year old, I'm willing to admit that I spend most of my time under the illusion that either Harrison Ford or Hanks is my dad in some strange spectral way. He's the dad of my generation, and yet, when asked to come on a BBC <em>radio</em> show, he takes it sufficiently seriously that he puts \"far too much thought\" into the list of records he is asked to choose, records that will travel with him to the desert island he has been sent to, a place much like the desert island he is sent to in Cast Away, which is Zemeckis <em>and</em> Hanks, and thus money in the bank as far as I am concerned.</p><p>When I got off the bus, I felt even closer to Hanks than I did before, which is already alarmingly close, as you might have gathered. I was also struck by his choice of an item to take with him to the island: a Hermes 3000 typewriter. I've known for years that Hanks loves typewriters. In a New Yorker profile from the 1990s, I think he was trying to track down a Skywriter or somesuch, a specially designed machine that would fit snugly into the folding tray of a 1950s commuter flight seat. Then, a few years back, some fans sent him a 1934 Smith Corona when they asked him to come on their podcast, and he typed them <a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/10/damn-you-all-to-hell.html\" target=\"_blank\">a lovely note</a> on it in reply. A note from Hanks! Or Hanx, rather, as he signs his Tweets, many of which - Hanx really is the best - revolve around items he has found on the street and wants to get back to their owners. You know the lone glove you always get propped on one of the railings outside of a cemetery? Hanx is <em>there</em> for that glove.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-12-in-honour-of-tom-hanks-desert-island-discs-here-is-a-belated-piece-about-his-typewriter-app\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-12-in-honour-of-tom-hanks-desert-island-discs-here-is-a-belated-piece-about-his-typewriter-app</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1829961</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Why you shouldn't ignore Uncharted 4's multiplayer</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2015/articles/1/8/2/9/9/1/0/why-you-shouldnt-ignore-uncharted-4s-multiplayer-1463043653616.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1829910.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>I absolutely loved The Last of Us.

At a launch party an emotional Peter Molyneux held aloft glowing reviews and praised the exhausted team of developers who had spent the previous four years pouring everything they had into the game. Fable 2 would go on to win a BAFTA and become the best-selling role-playing game for the Xbox 360. Lionhead was on top of the world.</p><p>Seven-and-a-half years later, Lionhead's 100 or so staff were called to its in-house cafe for a meeting. There, Hanno Lemke, General Manager of Microsoft Studios Europe, announced that Fable Legends was cancelled and Lionhead would close. The famed studio Peter Molyneux co-founded nearly 20 years ago was dead.</p><p>The inside story of how Lionhead rose and fell is difficult but also important. Those who worked there describe a studio high on the fumes of furious creativity, a place where mind-numbing failure would often accompany agenda-setting success. They describe a fiercely British culture that benefited - and suffered - from an American overlord hell bent on winning the console war.

That was the challenge facing sound designer, Paul Lackey, in the early stages of the game's development. 'What sounds truly satisfying?' he found himself thinking, as he grabbed a drink one evening after work. Overwatch's hit pip is now a reversed audio clip of the wonderful \"pssht\" noise that comes with opening a beer bottle. Of course it is.</p><p>My video's got nothing to do with that anecdote, but I thought I'd share it because it's a useful reminder that sound design is full of clever little innovations just like that. I caught a talk at this year's GDC which explained how Overwatch uses its audio to convey loads of information to its players, allowing them to react almost instinctively to everything they hear. It's really impressive, and I think it's time we talked about game audio a little more.</p><p>So let's do that!

It has been since its inception in 2000, and the latest instalment (helpfully differentiated as Hitman<em>&#7488;&#7481;</em>) is a hugely welcome return to form. Despite its focus on methodical professionalism and minimal exposure, the series has always been surprisingly lenient with allowing you to play it wrong. We've all done it; a Silent Assassin attempt goes awry and instead of rage-quitting, something snaps and we start getting even. Running around with guns blazing, innocents fleeing in panic while security piles in. It becomes a fight against the odds, an endurance challenge where luck is as important as skill. In one glorious fumble you go from elite professional to deranged mass-murderer. </p><p>Whenever the game does descend into misanthropic carnage, I always have one place in mind. My Agent 47 invariably runs a trail of destruction all the way to the nearest toilet. Any old hand knows that a loo is often the best place to stick it out if they want to emerge victorious. </p><p>You may well have seen a gif or two showing the possibilities of murder in Hitman's lavatories, but it's impossible to underestimate the defensibility of most toilets in the Hitman universe. The AI's inability to cope with the situation helps a lot, but really it's just about camping in a dead end so you only have a single doorway to worry about. It just so happens that video game toilets are <em>really</em> good at providing this kind of space, and Hitman's are second to none. The Paris level that forms the bed of this new episodic Hitman has occupiable wardrobes <em>inside</em> most toilets, which is some kind of stealth gaming nirvana for cheap players, allowing you to hide inside a hiding place inside your hiding place - Hitmanception. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-12-hitman-and-the-joy-of-playing-it-wrong\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-12-hitman-and-the-joy-of-playing-it-wrong</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1829568</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 08:34:00 +0100</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Ace Attorney 6 set for a western release this September</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2015/articles/1/8/2/9/8/1/7/ace-attorney-6-set-for-western-eshop-release-this-september-1462983034654.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1829817.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>\nPhoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice, the new name for what was formerly known as Ace Attorney 6, will arrive this September as a 3DS-exclusive in Europe and North America.</p><p>It will only be available as a digital download on the eShop, where it will cost \u00a324.99 / &#8364;29.99 / $29.99.</p><p>Spirit of Justice is set in the mystical Kingdom of Khura'in, a land without lawyers where justice is decided through mystics using \"s\u00e9ance trials\".

Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer,\" says Ben Goldacre in his book Bad Pharma. He also says quite a bit more beside, because medicine really is very broken. This is 1) terrible, because all of us rely on medicine at one time or another and have a basic faith in the white-coated ministers who provide it, and 2) a marvellous opportunity to make an extremely evil strategy game. </p><p>\nI want to recruit male students as research subjects, inject them with untried ingredients until their kidneys expire, and hide the results. I want to cynically patent my most-needed medicines and inflate the price to a monumental premium. I want to cancel all research projects on non-remunerative ailments and watch my little profit ticker tick cheerfully into the black. I want to run aggressive advertising campaigns telling people that their perfectly normal sex lives are a dispiriting shadow of human pleasure's deepest possibilities, and hawk them drugs to fix the problem I've invented. And you will know me by the trail of suppressed trials and out-of-court settlements.</p><p>\nI don't actually get to do many of these things in the game Big Pharma, sadly. I came looking for Civilization with blister packs instead of militia, I got a factory sim. Day-to-day operations largely involve drug manufacture, with a bit of research and development on the side. A huge amount of time can be spent assembling production lines. The various machines (dissolvers, mixers, ionisers, pill printers, and so on) all have differently oriented inputs and outputs, so constructing or repurposing a line to make the most of valuable space is a logic puzzle in itself. This is disappointing: if I were a malevolent corporate drug pusher, the logistics are definitely the part of the operation I would outsource. Does Auric Goldfinger have to build his own torture devices? No he does not. It feels like an insult to the dignity of my villainy. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-11-even-with-the-marketing-and-malpractice-dlc-big-pharma-just-isnt-evil-enough\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-11-even-with-the-marketing-and-malpractice-dlc-big-pharma-just-isnt-evil-enough</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1829678</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 14:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>EA unconcerned about releasing Titanfall 2 and Battlefield 1 this autumn</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2015/articles/1/8/2/9/7/3/6/-1462964328939.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1829736.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>In last night's EA financial splurge we learned that <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-10-titanfall-2-confirmed-for-q4\">Titanfall 2 will release alongside Battlefield 1 this autumn</a>.

In actual fact, it was a zeppelin, vast and menacing, presented via a slightly dodgy cable channel special effect, and it was on fire because of the plucky Brits. When German zeppelins raided England in the First World War, the slightly dodgy cable channel documentary explained, they were grim agents of terror, ghosting over the channel at night, flinging their bombs and leaving devastation, death and a profound sense of national violation behind them. For a while, there was no counter, either, until people started to think about the flammable gases that kept the zeppelins afloat. Could that be the key?</p><p>It could. But it relied upon two inventions, both of them bullets. The first bullet would explode on impact and punch a huge hole in the zeppelin's skin, letting in air. The second would catch on fire as it flew through towards its target - it was filled with some kind of fuel, and had a little valve covered with solder that would melt away during firing. The two bullets worked in tandem together - they had to be loaded into guns, one then the other, over and over - and after a little debugging, they handled the zeppelins fairly efficiently. Boom. </p><p>Before I watched this documentary - and as my vague recollection suggests, I only half watched it even then - the only indication I had that zeppelins ever struck England in the first world war came from the second book of the Regeneration trilogy, when one of the characters visits a neighborhood in war-time London that has been reduced to rubble by an overnight strike. My point being, I think, that history is huge and filled with stuff I don't know about, and I'm grateful to plug the gaps anyway I can. I've been thinking about this ever since the release of the Battlefield 1 trailer. A lot of people have been wondering over the ethics of making a game like that - and certainly at the very least a trailer like that - about a war that was so bloody and grotesque.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-11-can-battlefield-1-help-us-see-the-great-war-with-fresh-eyes\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-11-can-battlefield-1-help-us-see-the-great-war-with-fresh-eyes</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1829457</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 09:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Raiden 5 review</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2015/articles/1/8/1/7/2/6/4/raiden-5-review-1457696465465.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1817264.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p><em>Editor's note: To mark the EU release of Raiden 5 on Xbox One, we're republishing our original import review of the game, which first appeared on the site this March.</em></p><p>For 20 years the trend in shmups has been to pack the screen with as many bullets as possible, but Raiden likes to play things a little differently.

What that means is relatively low numbers of bullets on-screen at a given time, stripped back scoring mechanisms, and a dose of the hard military sci-fi theme that dominated the emergence of the genre at a time scrolling playfields were becoming a norm.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-11-raiden-5-review\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-11-raiden-5-review</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1817264</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Uncharted 4's really meta hidden Trophies revealed</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2015/articles/1/8/2/9/6/3/4/uncharted-4-has-a-couple-of-really-meta-hidden-trophies-1462927974702.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1829634.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>\nUncharted 4: A thief's End just launched yesterday and folks have discovered a couple of very funny, self-deprecating hidden Trophies.</p><p>As reported by <a href=\"http://www.playstationtrophies.org/game/uncharted-4/trophy/140663-Ludonarrative-Dissonance.html\" target=\"_blank\">PlayStationTrophies</a>, there's a hidden Trophy called Stage Fright that can be obtained by reenacting the controller malfunction that occurred during the game's E3 2015 stage demo, leaving Nathan Drake idly standing in a market for 30 seconds.</p><p>Another amusing Trophy is called \"Ludonarrative Dissonance,\" a phrase coined by Far Cry 2 director Clint Hocking to describe the disconnect between a game's narrative elements and its gameplay. Uncharted has often been mocked for being about a supposedly likable rogue who just so happens to recklessly slaughter hundreds of people.

The Witcher 3's second expansion, Blood &amp; Wine, is a treat - as welcome a return to the adventures of monster hunter Geralt as you could ask for. It's even bigger than we've been led to believe. More than 30 hours of content - not 20 as we've been previously told - in a new region the size of No Man's Land, but at very different ends of the visual spectrum.</p><p>Whereas No Man's Land is ravaged by war, the new region of Toussaint is untouched by it, an idyll reminiscent of Southern France that's bursting with life and colour, a whole new palette of crumbly old buildings drenched in golden sunlight and wrapped in ivy. It is distractingly beautiful - a fairytale land of knights and chivalry, the ornate palace of Beauclair jutting like a Disney centre-point in the middle. But it's also a region stalked by a mysterious and merciless killer, one who turns out to be far more complex than you at first imagine.</p><p>But arguably the two standout features in Blood &amp; Wine are its new Mutation character development system, and how it gives you - Geralt - a vineyard. Yes that's right, no more sleeping on the road: a place to finally call your own. And you can upgrade it, eventually unlocking buffs applied when you sleep there. These buffs range from extra health for Geralt to extra stamina for his horse Roach, extra potion uses or extra experience point gain.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-06-witcher-3-expansion-blood-and-wine-preview\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-06-witcher-3-expansion-blood-and-wine-preview</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1828803</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 16:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Witcher 3: Blood and Wine release date officially announced</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2015/articles/1/8/2/9/5/2/9/-1462891941376.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1829529.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>CD Projekt Red has officially announced the release date for the second, and final, Witcher 3 expansion Blood and Wine.

However, at the time of writing, there is no update to be found - hopefully it'll be along shortly [<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Microsoft's PR agency tells us it should be available at 6pm UK time]. We are looking forward to testing it; while games may require updates to allow the functionality to work, we do wonder whether we can now force v-sync off via the GPU control panel - something that definitely doesn't work in the current build.

The updates to Need for Speed since launch have helped move it in the right direction, and it'll be interesting to see how the series moves forward with next year's game - though it's unlikely we'll get a look at the next Need for Speed until early next year. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-10-new-need-for-speed-coming-in-2017\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-10-new-need-for-speed-coming-in-2017</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1829527</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 15:42:00 +0100</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Watch: Ian plays Uncharted 4 multiplayer</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2015/articles/1/8/2/9/4/8/9/-1462886297094.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1829489.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Well, the wait is finally over.
