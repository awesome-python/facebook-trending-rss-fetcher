Duda was on the base to meet with Canadian Armed Forces personnel who participated in Operation REASSURANCE in Poland. (Sean Kilpatrick/CP)</p></div>\n<p>Andrzej Duda, it turns out, gives as good as he gets. Poland&#8217;s president was in Toronto, Niagara-on-the-Lake and Ottawa this week to meet with business leaders, members of Canada&#8217;s substantial Polish diaspora\u2014and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as both leaders prepare for the Warsaw NATO summit in July.</p>\n<p>Duda&#8217;s visit was politically delicate for Ottawa&#8217;s Liberals. Trudeau and Foreign Minister St\u00e9phane Dion are eager to reassert Canada&#8217;s support for Poland&#8217;s eastern neighbour Ukraine, and for Poland as a key ally in NATO and the EU. But Ottawa has kept abreast of a\u00a0constant stream of critical Western coverage of Duda&#8217;s party, the socially conservative Law and Justice (whose Polish acronym is &#8220;PiS,&#8221;) which won both the presidency and a parliamentary majority in separate elections last year. <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/polands-bad-turn-1452122970\" target=\"_blank\">Editorials</a>\u00a0and comments in interviews and opinion articles from such prominent Polophiles as <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/05/03/poland-vs-history-museum-gdansk/\" target=\"_blank\">Timothy Snyder</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/24/polish-leaders-using-war-museum-to-rewrite-history-says-academic\" target=\"_blank\">Norman Davies</a> have criticized the new government for stacking public institutions, silencing critics, advancing a tendentious view of Polish and European history, and prosecuting internal grudges at the expense of Poland&#8217;s obligations within Europe and NATO.</p>\n<p>In the end, the Trudeau government reached the same conclusion\u00a0most of Poland&#8217;s European allies have reached: that while it can take a dim view of individual government decisions, Poland is too important to ostracize. Trudeau met with Duda, but they did not meet reporters together. <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> requested an interview with Duda during his visit but was told he had time only to respond, in writing, to written questions submitted in advance. The questions were sent on Friday; the president&#8217;s answers arrived on Wednesday. Some of the questions were intended to provoke, and Duda was not shy in responding. Here is his exchange with <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em>:\u00a0<span id=\"more-872413\"></span></p>\n<h4>Q: The <a href=\"http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/248984,Foreign-Minister-discusses-Warsaw-NATO-Summit-in-Bratislava\" target=\"_blank\">NATO summit in Warsaw in July</a> will be preoccupied with challenges on NATO&#8217;s southern border, including the migrant crisis. Do you worry that NATO is too worried about the south and has not paid enough attention to the east?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> The Alliance must be based on the concept of solidarity and co-responsibility. That&#8217;s why there should be no division between the east and the south. Security cannot be divided. NATO must guarantee equal status to all its members and monitor all threats. The Warsaw summit should yield exactly such an outcome. We should forge a collective strategy for the east and the south, aimed at protecting the territory of all member states, protecting peace, protecting international law\u2014no matter where the current threats come from. It means that the eastern flank should be strengthened through defence infrastructure and reconnaissance capabilities. Meanwhile the southern flank needs a clear mandate for common action. I am convinced the Warsaw summit will bring us some definitive answers in this respect.</p>\n<h4>Q: What are Poland&#8217;s specific military requests along NATO&#8217;s eastern border? <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/world/europe/nato-russia-poland.html\" target=\"_blank\">Some reporters have suggested about 5,000 troops could be stationed</a> in Poland and the Baltics, on a rotating basis. Would that be enough?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I have been saying repeatedly: specific quantities do not matter. NATO should demonstrate that it is capable of creating new forces which would protect its eastern flank. It would constitute an enormous change. NATO must show it is a living, vibrant alliance. The threat from the east is not temporary. International rules have been trampled on, the sanctity of borders have been violated. Therefore I want NATO&#8217;s presence in the eastern flank to be substantial and adequate, considering the level of insecurity in our region. Specific numbers and specific locations are still subject to negotiation. From our point of view having American, Canadian or British troops on a rotating basis in Poland and in the Baltics would be an enormous boon to our defence capabilities. Not only in terms of physical presence. Regular joint exercises mean higher level of combat readiness and better coordination in command\u00ad-and-\u00adcontrol. This is particularly important taking into account the changing face of modern battleground. There are new challenges NATO must adapt to: from hybrid activities to cyberwarfare.</p>\n<h4><strong>Q:</strong> Elections produced two new governments in the fall of 2015: Justin Trudeau&#8217;s Liberal government in Canada, and a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-election-idUSKCN0SL1XH20151027\" target=\"_blank\">PiS parliamentary majority in Poland</a>. Have you seen any change in Canada&#8217;s response to the Russian challenge in Ukraine, and toward NATO in general, since last autumn that are worth bringing to the public&#8217;s attention?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Canada and Poland should further their efforts to reinforce the Ukrainian democracy. There has been a string of Polish\u00ad-Canadian initiatives aimed at strengthening the civic society in Ukraine and improving the democratic process at the municipal level. Both Poland and Canada should be advocates of long-\u00adlasting, peaceful solutions in eastern Ukraine, based on unconditional respect of international law.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_873147\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-873147\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11559862-1024x725.jpg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, left, shakes hands with Polish President Andrzej Duda before the start of a bilateral meeting on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Tuesday May 10, 2016.

(Fred Chartrand/CP)</p></div>\n<h4><strong>Q:</strong> The new PiS government has been controversial, not only in Poland. In April the European Parliament passed a motion saying it &#8220;is <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN0XA1AP\" target=\"_blank\">seriously concerned that the effective paralysis of the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland poses a danger to democracy</a>, human rights and the rule of law.&#8221; Why does the PiS government not take the EU&#8217;s concerns seriously?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> This is an internal political conflict, triggered by the previous governing coalition. It attempted to take ownership of the Constitutional Tribunal, violating&#8230; the constitution (which was later confirmed by the Constitutional Tribunal itself in one of its rulings). If they had succeeded, right now the opposition parties would have 14 out of 15 judges of their own choosing. Sadly, the head of this institution, Mr. Andrzej Rzepli\u0144ski, was actively promoting those unconstitutional amendments. He assumed the role of a politician, going far beyond his mandate. The current majority is just trying to restore pluralism and balance in the Constitutional Tribunal and is seeking to reach a compromise with the opposition.</p>\n<h4>Q: While in Canada you will visit with many Polish-Canadians. What will you tell them about Poland&#8217;s decision to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-refuses-to-take-a-single-refugee-because-of-security-fears-a7020076.html\" target=\"_blank\">accept no more migrants from Syria</a> and the surrounding region?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Poland is ready to admit every refugee who arrives in Poland, fleeing the war in the Middle East, no matter their faith or economic status, provided that they comply with our legal regulations and want to stay in our country. The point is that very few of them choose Poland as their final destination. That&#8217;s why we strongly oppose the relocation quotas and penalties that the European Commission is trying to impose on all member states. We cannot forcefully retain migrants in Poland. What if they wish to travel to Germany, Denmark or Sweden? What if they want to join their families in Hamburg or Malm\u00f6? Should we detain them? Restrain their freedoms? This policy is hardly &#8220;humanitarian.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>Q: Poland&#8217;s government is considering legislation that would make it a criminal offence to suggest Polish responsibility for the Holocaust. The Nazi regime&#8217;s murderous coercion of ordinary Poles is well known, as is the Polish people&#8217;s fierce resistance. But surely that resistance was not unanimous? Surely it should be acceptable <a href=\"http://forward.com/opinion/339141/how-poland-is-targeting-holocaust-scholar-jan-t-gross-for-the-sin-of-rememb/\" target=\"_blank\">for historians to examine the role individual Poles played during the war years</a>, even if some contributed to the Nazi atrocities?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Over six thousand Poles are listed in the Yad Vashem Institute as the Righteous Among the Nations. Can you name at least one of them? Probably not. Their sacrifice was mostly anonymous. A few weeks ago I had the honour to participate in the opening ceremony of a museum in Markowa, in southern Poland, commemorating the martyrdom of the Ulma family. During the war they saved a Jewish family from extermination. And they paid for this heroic deed with their own lives. All members of the Ulma family were slaughtered by Germans. All eight of them, including small children. Is this story really so well-\u00adknown abroad? I don&#8217;t think so. The name &#8220;Markowa&#8221; doesn&#8217;t appear too frequently in foreign media, unlike the outrageous term &#8220;Polish death camps.&#8221; Do you know that in war\u00adtime Poland, as opposed to many other countries in Europe, the Germans were unable to install a puppet regime? Do you know that the Polish government in exile and the Polish Underground Army appealed for all Poles to help Jews, in spite of the fact that the people who hid their Jewish neighbours faced instant execution? The new government has no intention to sue historians who investigate Polish anti\u00ad-Semitism. Their books are not only &#8220;acceptable,&#8221; they are necessary to fully understand all intricacies of the common history of Poles and Jews. Alas, for many years, we have witnessed a process of shifting blame for the Holocaust on others. No, we were not responsible for the Holocaust. The German Nazi regime was. Full stop.</p>\n<h4>Q: PiS governments have been preoccupied with <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21693499-conservatives-and-liberals-are-still-struggling-over-meaning-polands-post-communist\" target=\"_blank\">establishing that many Poles, still alive, collaborated with the Communists</a> during the Cold War. How could their collaboration with an authoritarian regime cause them public blame, while an earlier generation&#8217;s interaction with an earlier oppressor, the Nazis, becomes a forbidden topic of historical investigation? This looks like a serious double standard.</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> No, it doesn&#8217;t. As I said before, there was no Polish puppet regime steered by Germans during the war. Acts of anti\u00ad-Semitism and atrocities committed by individuals were unacceptable but rare. But we have admitted the truth. We have recognized the fact that some Poles behaved hideously under occupation. Conversely, most communist apparatchiks were neither prosecuted nor officially condemned for what they did in the &#8217;50s or in the &#8217;80s. After the fall of communism many of them lived unmolested in their villas, cashing in hefty pensions. And many Poles who collaborated with the regime continued their careers in academia, business, politics. Can you spot the difference? I&#8217;ll give you one telling example. When Mr. Jan Tomasz Gross&#8217;s books about Polish anti-\u00adSemitism were published in Warsaw, they were widely acclaimed by liberal critics. Meanwhile historians who were trying to describe the involvement of current elites in the communist system of oppression were ostentatiously discredited and ostracized. Yes, double standards were applied in Poland, but the other way round.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/polands-president-on-nato-refugees-his-critics-and-the-burden-of-history/\">Poland&#8217;s president on NATO, his critics and the burden of history</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/polands-president-on-nato-refugees-his-critics-and-the-burden-of-history/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>On electoral reform, Maryam Monsef wants to &#8216;get this right&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/on-electoral-reform-maryam-monsef-wants-to-get-this-right/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/on-electoral-reform-maryam-monsef-wants-to-get-this-right/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:54:17 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[electoral reform]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Maryam Monsef]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=872855</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>This is not about partisanship, says the minister, as she puts Liberals in charge</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/on-electoral-reform-maryam-monsef-wants-to-get-this-right/\">On electoral reform, Maryam Monsef wants to &#8216;get this right&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_872995\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-872995\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MAY13_MONSEF_POST02.jpg\" alt=\"Maryam Monsef, Minister of Democratic Institutions, and Dominic LeBlanc, Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, make an announcement regarding electoral reform during a press conference at the National Press Theatre in Ottawa on Wednesday, May 11, 2016.

(Sean Kilpatrick/CP)</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;This is not about advancing a skewed partisan interest,&#8221; Maryam Monsef said yesterday as she announced a new parliamentary committee to discuss electoral reform. A majority of the members on the committee are Liberals, but you&#8217;re not being helpful when you point that out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to move beyond a system that pits neighbour against neighbour,&#8221; said Monsef, the youngest minister in Justin Trudeau&#8217;s cabinet but, I suspect, nowhere close to\u00a0the most naive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In a multi-party democracy like Canada,&#8221; she said, &#8220;first past the post&#8221;\u2014the system that gives each riding to the candidate with the largest number of votes, regardless of whether that candidate came close to winning a majority of local votes\u2014&#8221;distorts the will of the electorate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was first-past-the-post that produced\u2014well, most of Canada&#8217;s majority governments. Let&#8217;s put it that way, in an\u00a0effort to avoid pitting\u00a0neighbour against neighbour. If I pointed out that the current government, led by Justin Trudeau, controls 54 per cent of the seats in the Commons based on a little more than 39 per cent of the popular vote, it might pit you against your neighbour. If I point out that the previous government, led by Stephen Harper, controlled almost the same fraction of the seats in the Commons based on almost the same fraction of the popular vote, your neighbour might rise up and smite you. And today just isn&#8217;t about smiting, all right? It just isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our government believes all Canadians&#8217; voices should be heard,&#8221; Monsef said. And: &#8220;We want to ensure that Canadians across our diverse society are involved in this historic change.&#8221; Does that include some Canadians in particular? It sure does. &#8220;This includes Canadians that often go unheard such as women, young people, seniors, Indigenous persons, new Canadians, those of modest means, those Canadians living in rural and remote communities.&#8221; Excellent. But beyond those groups, which together actually add up to\u00a0a large majority of Canadians, is this process also about the rest?</p>\n<p>It sure is. &#8220;We\u2019ll be looking for opportunities to inspire all Canadians to vote and to be active participants,&#8221; Monsef said.</p>\n<p>So. All Voices. Across our diverse society. Because the current system distorts the will of the electorate. To avoid pitting neighbour against neighbour. Because skewed partisan interests are not what this is about advancing.

Here was the second: &#8220;You\u2019ve got a committee with 10 members and I think you\u2019ve got six.&#8221; &#8220;You&#8221; in this sentence means the Liberals, which I suppose is true if you insist on taking a skewed partisan interest. &#8220;It looks like you hogged all the seats. So how is it not skewed?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Monsef: The committee &#8220;reflects the composition of the House of Commons.&#8221; With bonus added diversity, in the form of Bloc and Green MPs who will not have voting privileges but will be welcome to listen and talk.</p>\n<p>More questions from the surly gallery, this time in French, which were taken by Monsef&#8217;s colleague, the government House leader Dominic LeBlanc. One question was on referendums. &#8220;The referendum question is much like putting a cart before the horse,&#8221; Monsef said. &#8220;Right now our priority is hearing from a broad range of Canadians from across the country.\u00a0I\u2019m particularly interested in hearing from those Canadians who don\u2019t normally engage in the democratic process and don\u2019t normally vote.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This was\u00a0all Kabuki theatre. The party composition of the committee matters because the main parties have different ideas about how, or even whether, reform should happen. Justin Trudeau knows this. He even <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-apologizes-electoral-reform-1.3568632\" target=\"_blank\">apologized to the Commons last week</a> for suggesting his opponents&#8217; views have slowed down his government&#8217;s consultations.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related from <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em>:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/do-the-liberals-have-a-mandate-for-electoral-reform/\">Do the Liberals have a mandate for electoral reform?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Most Liberals like a preferential-ballot system, in which you rank your choices, because many voters who prefer\u00a0a specific party to the Liberals&#8217; left or right will list the Liberals as second choice. This would tend to encourage Liberal majorities built, in large measure, from shrugs and why-nots.</p>\n<p>The NDP, with a disproportionate number of support\u00a0from voters who would shrug and why-not the Liberals on their undercard, prefers a proportional system in which first choices would count and endure.</p>\n<p>The Conservatives, who won three elections on splits, the way elections are usually won in this country, don&#8217;t like any of this talk. They want the people to decide, in a referendum, essentially rediscovering the Reform Party&#8217;s taste for popular democracy after Stephen Harper low-bridged that element of his Conservative party&#8217;s heritage for a decade.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-quagmire-of-electoral-reform-and-the-hunt-for-political-legitimacy/\">The quagmire of electoral reform and the hunt for legitimacy</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, here&#8217;s the thing. <em>Each</em> of these positions <em>is legitimate</em>, in the sense that each position\u00a0protects some values while giving others short shrift. A ranked ballot would be simple but it&#8217;s bad at ensuring diverse opinions get represented in the House. (As long as you represent the big non-diverse opinion a ranked ballot tends to lift up, you <em>like</em> this result, and you view it as &#8220;not advancing a skewed partisan interest.&#8221;) Proportional representation lets a hundred flowers bloom but it can be hard to explain to bored or distracted voters (who are, incidentally, <em>allowed</em>, in a democracy, to be bored or distracted; and in any case are hard to excite or focus). Referendums do give each voter a voice, although that doesn&#8217;t make them perfect: they&#8217;re best only for simple choices, and by that same token they can exaggerate, and worsen, regional differences.</p>\n<p>It would be really excellent if Canada&#8217;s minister of democratic reform would demonstrate an understanding of these disputes. I promise you this one understands them very well. I&#8217;m not even <em>entirely</em> sure she has cooked this process to produce the Liberals&#8217; favourite outcome, although one notes that everything\u00a0in this process makes the Liberals&#8217; favourite outcome\u00a0the likeliest.</p>\n<p>But the minister&#8217;s determined insistence that there is (on one hand) a commonly accepted common interest and (on the other hand) no particular need to put that notion to a population-wide vote, produces a paradox: She seems so nice. And she is acting the way someone would act if she were trying to pull a fast one.</p>\n<p>Will she act on the committee&#8217;s recommendations or will the cabinet\u00a0do what it wants? &#8220;The feedback we receive from the committee will be invaluable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yes, but once the committee reports, who\u00a0will have the final say? &#8220;The final decision will be a decision made by 338 MPs in the House of Commons, and then Senate will have an opportunity to review the legislation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She wants to get this right. She said so three times. &#8220;We want to get this right.&#8221; Apparently we&#8217;ll have to trust her.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/on-electoral-reform-maryam-monsef-wants-to-get-this-right/\">On electoral reform, Maryam Monsef wants to &#8216;get this right&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/on-electoral-reform-maryam-monsef-wants-to-get-this-right/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>10</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>PKP: Farewell to the PQ&#8217;s last-chance man</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/pierre-karl-peladeau-farewell-to-the-pqs-last-chance-man/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/pierre-karl-peladeau-farewell-to-the-pqs-last-chance-man/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 20:08:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Pierre-Karl Peladeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Quebec]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=867031</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells on Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau's historically short, ill-suited leadership of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, and what comes next</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/pierre-karl-peladeau-farewell-to-the-pqs-last-chance-man/\">PKP: Farewell to the PQ&#8217;s last-chance man</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_867055\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-867055\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MAC19_PKP_POST.jpg\" alt=\"Parti Quebecois leader Pierre-Karl Peladeau announces his resignation at a news conference, Monday, May 2, 2016 in Montreal.

(Ryan Remiorz/CP)</p></div>\n<p>It will be super-interesting to speculate on Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau&#8217;s motives for leaving the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leadership and retiring from politics, two weeks short of the first anniversary of his elevation to the party&#8217;s top job. But whatever personal\u00a0motives he might have had, the PQ&#8217;s extended existential crisis would surely be reason enough to quit.</p>\n<p>Ten days ago a <a href=\"http://www.985fm.ca/actualites/nouvelles/sondage-crop-couillard-fait-mieux-que-charest-771830.html\" target=\"_blank\">CROP poll</a> put voter support for the PQ at 26 per cent. It has not won more than 40 per cent of the popular vote in a general election since 1998, the only election year in which Lucien Bouchard led the party. The Quebec Liberals also won more than 40 per cent on that night, and have done so three more times since. The PQ&#8217;s\u00a025.38 per cent of popular vote in the 2014 election under Pauline Marois&#8217;s leadership was, famously, its lowest in 44 years. Under P\u00e9ladeau, with the bloom rather seriously off the rose of Philippe Couillard&#8217;s Liberal government, the PQ remains within a point of that historic-low score.</p>\n<p>No elected PQ leader served a shorter time than P\u00e9ladeau. No elected leader in the party&#8217;s history (I&#8217;m keeping the distinction between elected and interim leaders) quit before his first general election campaign. P\u00e9ladeau&#8217;s speed record is healthy for the party: His short temper, inept public-speaking style, chaotic office management, delight in collecting\u00a0and prosecuting grudges, cruelly faulty\u00a0understanding of Quebec history and politics, spectacularly limited attention span and tabloid-fodder family life made him one of the most ill-suited party leaders I have ever seen in any party in any jurisdiction. The PQ is well rid of him.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>From Martin Patriquin:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/pierre-karl-peladeau-a-man-of-brash-impulses-gives-in-to-another/\" target=\"_blank\">P\u00e9ladeau exits politics as he arrived\u2014hastily</a><span id=\"more-867031\"></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>The surprise is that this was not obvious to the PQ. In fact, this simple and radiant bundle of self-evident facts about P\u00e9ladeau will continue to elude some members of the party, and we should look forward to hearing, forevermore after each successive PQ shortfall in this or that election or referendum, that &#8220;PKP could have done it.&#8221; Wishful thinking remains one of the strongest forces in politics. Not only in the PQ. Certainly in the PQ.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what will become of the Institute for Sovereignty P\u00e9ladeau wanted to set up, on his own dime, to churn out studies designed to prove that Quebec would be better off outside Confederation. I&#8217;m not sure who&#8217;ll replace P\u00e9ladeau. Former broadcaster Bernard Drainville, perhaps, whose Charter of Quebec Values helped drive the PQ to spectacular defeat in 2014. Author and former journalist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e, perhaps, though he seems to have established himself in a brief attempt to compete against P\u00e9ladeau as every anglophone&#8217;s favourite P\u00e9quiste. There are young candidates, including Alexandre Cloutier, a former Supreme Court of Canada law clerk who was intergovernmental affairs minister under Pauline Marois.</p>\n<p>The next leader, one of these or any other, will be helped by the Couillard government&#8217;s spotty record of achievement and the Liberal premier&#8217;s difficulty sustaining\u00a0any emotional bond with voters.\u00a0That&#8217;s the nicest thing I can say about the PQ today.</p>\n<p>The party&#8217;s nearly two-decade slump in voter support results from serious institutional divisions among parties representing the non-Liberal vote. Some of the PQ vote has gone to the soft-nationalist, centre-right CAQ party. Some has gone to the harder-nationalist, left-wing Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire. A lot of the PQ vote simply stays home on election nights. Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau didn&#8217;t invent those circumstances and they remain with his departure. The morning after he won the PQ leadership\u2014less than a year ago!\u2014P\u00e9ladeau woke to find a front-page column by Michel David in <em>Le Devoir</em> calling him <a href=\"http://www.ledevoir.com/politique/quebec/440302/l-homme-de-la-derniere-chance\" target=\"_blank\">the PQ&#8217;s last-chance man</a>.

Stephen Harper spoke to the group repeatedly, and used an early speech in 2003 to begin the process of uniting Canada&#8217;s conservative parties. As secret societies go, it&#8217;s not all that secret, really. But members are asked not to divulge one another&#8217;s identity publicly, or to share details of the conference program. But after I mentioned Civitas in <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/coming-soon-conservatives-attempt-harper-reimagining/\">my latest column</a>, I was sent the program for this year&#8217;s conference. (Note to Civitas disciplinarians: There&#8217;s no point guessing who sent it. You&#8217;ll guess wrong.)</p>\n<p>Highlights of this year&#8217;s conference include a debate over whether Harper was a success, with David Frum, the former speechwriter for George W.

I have friends who will attend, but because I am not reliably conservative I\u2019m not invited and my friends are keeping mum about what they\u2019ll discuss. Civitas\u2019s website bills the group as \u201ca non-partisan \u2018society where ideas meet\u2019 \u201d and specifies that the ideas in question are \u201cconservative, classical liberal and libertarian.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beyond that one is left to guess: without a log-in and password, you can\u2019t get any more information from the website. I\u2019m told Barbara Kay, the <em>National Post</em> columnist, will be there, and that Conrad Black generally attends. Its founding directors included Ted Byfield, Michael Coren and Ezra Levant, and the genesis of the group is generally attributed to author William Gairdner, who has been urging me politely to tell you about his new book, <em>The Great Divide: Why Liberals and Conservatives Will Never, Ever Agree</em>. Consider it done, Bill. On the Civitas website you can spot photos of Andrew Coyne, who used to work here, and Brian Lee Crowley, who runs an Ottawa think tank.</p>\n<p>Also <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/stephen-harper/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Harper</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2003, Harper used a speech to Civitas to launch his bid to reform Canadian conservatism. He was already the leader of the Canadian Alliance, but that was of no particular use to anyone, and he wasn\u2019t yet sure the rival Conservatives were worth a merger. But whichever party carried the standard for Canadian conservatives, Harper had strong opinions about what it should stand for.</p>\n<p>Harper\u2019s Civitas speech, published after the event, stands as a sort of manifesto for Harper conservatism. Let us look at what that entailed one more time, as the contenders to replace Harper as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada start to cobble together their own philosophies.</p>\n<p>Calling for tax cuts wasn\u2019t enough, Harper said in 2003, because any Liberal could cut taxes if backed into a corner. Jean Chr\u00e9tien had done just that in the most recent federal election. No, the Conservatives needed to make their stand on ground on which no other party would want to encroach.</p>\n<p>\u201cSerious conservative parties simply cannot shy away from values questions,\u201d Harper said. \u201cOn a wide range of public policy questions\u2014including foreign affairs and defence, criminal justice and corrections, family and child care, and health care and social services\u2014social values are increasingly the really big issues.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he talked about family, what did he mean? \u201cBanning child pornography, raising the age of sexual consent, providing choice in education and strengthening the institution of marriage. All of these items are key to a conservative agenda.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harper always believed that the positions that upset his critics the most were among the keys to his success. Chantal H\u00e9bert wrote in 2007 that while many people like to call themselves fiscal conservatives and social liberals, Harper\u2019s new government was fiscally liberal and socially conservative. It was a good line. But the inversion was no accident, it was the plan.</p>\n<p>The plan fell apart in the end. Harper used the majority he won in the 2011 election to spend four years indulging his worst instincts. His decade at 24 Sussex makes him the longest-serving Conservative prime minister since Sir John A. Macdonald, but his successors must reimagine the Conservative party for its next chapter, if there is to be one.</p>\n<p>Early progress has been shaky. <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/maxime-bernier-makes-conservative-party-leadership-bid-official/\" target=\"_blank\">Maxime Bernier</a>, who was once actually Canada\u2019s foreign minister, probably has the strongest brand identity in the early going. He is for the opposite of Harperism: socially laissez-faire, fiscally strongly libertarian. He leads a small, fervent faction in the party, too small to do him much good. He faces an uphill climb.</p>\n<p>But at least he has a philosophy. <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/behind-kellie-leitchs-sort-of-campaign-for-conservative-leader/\" target=\"_blank\">Kellie Leitch</a>, the Ontario pediatric surgeon, has an experienced campaign staff of Ontario Tories, no perceptible support in the federal caucus and a hard time explaining why she proposed a telephone tip line for \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d during last year\u2019s election campaign. She is now sorry she did it. It\u2019s not really a platform.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/Jason-Kenney/\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Kenney</a>, the architect of the Conservatives\u2019 ethnic outreach, had a bad 2015: his party did everything but drive immigrant voters to the polling station so they could vote Liberal. On Twitter you can see him test-driving elements of a new appeal: resentment at lefty media bias, nostalgia for a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the U.K., and persistent Ralph Klein hero-worship. That last should deliver Kenney most of the party\u2019s Alberta and Saskatchewan support. Kenney is at least trying to block off areas he can secure against other candidates.</p>\n<p>If anyone uses Civitas to test-drive leadership pitches, the rest of us won\u2019t hear about it. But no pretender to Harper\u2019s tarnished crown has much time. The party\u2019s national convention is in Vancouver at the end of May. The party will elect a new leader a year later. The next campaign against Justin Trudeau will be two years after that. If that seems like a long time to you, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t have to do it. To the one who does, every day of it will feel like a sprint.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/coming-soon-conservatives-attempt-harper-reimagining/\">Life after Harper: Reimagining the Conservatives</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/coming-soon-conservatives-attempt-harper-reimagining/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>37</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Paul Wells on Prince: A talent for genius</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/the-joy-in-repetition-princes-floods-of-genius/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/the-joy-in-repetition-princes-floods-of-genius/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 22:11:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Arts]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[prince]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=863479</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Virtuosic, inventive, and relentlessly prolific, Prince couldn't help himself from creating music, and we're all the better for it</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/the-joy-in-repetition-princes-floods-of-genius/\">Paul Wells on Prince: A talent for genius</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_863643\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-863643\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC18_PRINCE-OBIT_POST04.jpg\" alt=\"Prince performs live at the Fabulous Forum on February 19, 1985 in Inglewood, California.

(Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s striking how often the lyrics in Prince tunes depart from their own storyline to comment on the construction of the song as it&#8217;s happening. &#8220;Horns, stand please,&#8221; he commands in &#8220;Sexy M.F.&#8221;, just before the horn line plays. Or in &#8220;Joy in Repetition&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Up on the mic repeating two words, over and over again<br />\nWas this woman he had never noticed before he lost himself in the<br />\nArticulated manner in which she said them.<br />\nThese two words, a little bit behind the beat.<br />\nI mean just enough to turn you on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There have always been bandleaders with only a limited connection to the musicians backing them up, singers who didn&#8217;t know what key they were in, stars as comfortable with a recorded backup tape as with flesh-and-blood collaborators. Prince wasn&#8217;t one of those. His engagement with the structure and texture of the music around him was extraordinarily intense and sustained.\u00a0On his first few albums\u2014beginning with <em>For You</em> when he was 19 years old in 1978\u2014he plays every instrument. On any of the astounding number of albums that followed, it was never entirely clear which bass, keyboard, drum or guitar parts were played by members of his various bands\u2014the Revolution, the New Power Generation\u2014and\u00a0which by Prince.</p>\n<p>It is difficult\u00a0to attempt a definitive discography because it&#8217;s impossible to know where to stop counting: he so often turned up on colleagues&#8217; albums without credit that the extent of his contribution to albums by, say, Morris Day and The Time, or by saxophonist Eric Leeds&#8217; instrumental jazz/R&amp;B band Madhouse, remains a matter of speculation among fans. Suffice it to say, he was astonishingly prolific.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/how-prince-rock-musics-effortlessly-dangerous-superstar-changed-the-game/\" target=\"_blank\">How Prince, rock&#8217;s effortlessly dangerous superstar, changed the game</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The struggle over the copyright\u00a0to all that good music led to him spending years peddling his recordings\u00a0under the sign of an unpronounceable symbol\u2014those were the &#8220;Artist Formerly Known as Prince&#8221; years. And to some extent it led him to exhaust and outrun most of his audience. After paying him little attention for years, I bought two of his last albums when he released them simultaneously in 2014: the self-conscious\u00a0and unpersuasive <em>Art Official Age</em> and the loose, arena-rock-tinged\u00a0<em>Plectrumelectrum</em>, the latter recorded with a new all-female backing band, 3rdEyeGirl. I was unsurprised to be reminded, just now, that he kept releasing new work even after that, including the tight, pop-bright <em>HitnRun Phase One</em> and <em>Two </em>last autumn. One of the tracks on those albums is called &#8220;Ain&#8217;t About 2 Stop&#8221;; it&#8217;s safe to assume that if he&#8217;d lived to be 80 he&#8217;d have kept releasing four or so albums&#8217; worth of new material a year.</p>\n<p>This level of output does have parallels\u00a0in American popular music, but it far outstrips the leisurely productivity\u00a0to which most other artists have accustomed their audiences. Surely a lot of Prince admirers\u2014otherwise undeterred by his falsetto vocals, his unending\u00a0psychedelia, his cartoonish sexuality and the way he used 2 many symbolz until U h8ed him 4 it\u2014loved almost all the Prince they heard while simply wishing he would stop releasing so damned much. Most of the rest of the world simply stopped trying to keep up after a while.</p>\n<p>I doubt Prince cared much. Even though he was jealous about copyright, much of his behaviour suggests that for\u00a0him the main point of making music wasn&#8217;t to sell it, it was simply to keep recombining the fundamentals. &#8220;Joy in Repetition&#8221; was, like most of his other titles, largely autobiographical. I suspect he&#8217;d have kept making music if he&#8217;d been required to erase the files as he was going. He couldn&#8217;t help himself.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/why-the-2007-super-bowl-was-an-act-of-peak-prince/\" target=\"_blank\">The 2007 Super Bowl, a moment of peak Prince</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>One hardly knows where to begin charting the breadth of his output. That he could make a hit out of a song as odd as\u00a0&#8220;Kiss,&#8221; built from little more than bass drum, clavinet and blues falsetto, is amazing; that Tom Jones could cover the song and repeat the feat compounds the astonishment. The contrast with the lighter-waving ballad anthem &#8220;Purple Rain&#8221; is complete. For sheer density of invention and seriousness of purpose, perhaps nothing tops the 1987 double album <em>Sign O&#8217; The Times</em>, from its searing title track (&#8220;In September, my cousin tried reefer for the very first time/\u00a0Now he&#8217;s doing horse; it&#8217;s June&#8221;) to the\u00a0devotional anthem &#8220;The Cross,&#8221; I would put <em>Sign O&#8217; The Times</em> right up next to the best albums from, say, The Beatles and David Bowie for sustained creativity. At just about every turn, Prince makes you laugh at\u00a0his audacity. &#8220;I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man&#8221; is perhaps the only song in his discography that\u00a0describes\u00a0a young man <em>turning down</em> a sexual opportunity. His guitar solo on that track is a quarter-note rejection of the virtuosity in which he usually indulged. Here, as elsewhere, he tailored his work to the demands of the material at hand.</p>\n<p>Beyond the particulars of this or that song, Prince&#8217;s music fits solidly into a tradition of R&amp;B revues that made him the logical heir of Count Basie, Cab Calloway, James Brown and George Clinton.\u00a0In fact Prince&#8217;s instrumental virtuosity makes him a bit of an odd fit with those men, who made their mark as contractors and instigators of outside talent. But like them\u2014and especially like Clinton, who enjoyed a late-career revival when word spread that Prince&#8217;s sound came straight out of Clinton&#8217;s Parliament and Funkadelic collectives\u2014Prince bet big on variety, an emotional range that stretched from silly to profound, and especially on rhythmic drive from the first note to the last. Miles Davis came out of the same tradition and took it to starkly different ends, but nobody should have been surprised that Miles and Prince saw each other as kindred spirits and recorded together, briefly and to limited effect, late in Davis&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s not entirely sure where that lineage goes after Prince. To Kendrick Lamar, I sometimes think.</p>\n<p>Prince&#8217;s late concerts, usually played on short notice whenever the mood struck, were startling in their number, quality and in the large audiences that would drop everything to get to them. Like a fool, I missed a half-dozen chances in recent years to see him in Toronto or Montreal. He leaves so much compulsively produced music behind him that it&#8217;ll never really get old.

The Abadan oil refinery was under constant fire from the Iraqi air force during the Iran-Iraq conflict. (Henri Bureau/Sygma/Corbis)</p></div>\n<p>Few events in the 20th century were as large and remain as poorly understood by outsiders as the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq. From 1980 to 1988 the two countries, which share hundreds of miles of border, fought with ever-escalating desperation and brutality, at a combined cost of 680,000 killed or missing. The events of that war continue to have a profound effect nearly 30 years later, in a region where Canadian soldiers continue to play a little-understood role near active combat zones. But for most Westerners the Iran-Iraq war means nothing.</p>\n<p>Pierre Razoux was in Ottawa last week to receive a Distinguished Book Award from the Society for Military History. Razoux is the research director of the Institute for Strategic Research in Paris. His book <em>The Iran-Iraq War </em>shines extraordinary light on a war whose aftershocks still resonate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t understand the political situation in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East without understanding the Iran-Iraq war,\u201d Razoux told me. \u201cIt had the same impact in that region that the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/a-whole-new-picture-of-the-origins-of-the-great-war/\" target=\"_blank\">First World War</a> had on Europe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Why? As a military historian, Razoux found Iran-Iraq to be a grim candy shop of comparative tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s a replica in miniature of every 20th-century war. You find the trench warfare, the chemical warfare, the war of attrition, the mass offensives of the First World War. You also see the terrorist attacks, the armoured combat, the blitzkriegs of the Second World War. You see the wars of decolonization,\u201d including the mountain warfare of the Algerian war of independence and the various wars in Afghanistan, \u201cin <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/how-an-army-of-kurds-are-winning-against-islamic-state-against-the-odds/\" target=\"_blank\">Kurdistan</a>. The marsh war was like Vietnam. The air war was like the Arab-Israeli war with its advanced technology.\u201d</p>\n<p>But the end of the fighting didn\u2019t end the bloody war\u2019s repercussions. To the extent it had a winner, it was <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/in-the-shadow-of-911/\" target=\"_blank\">Saddam Hussein</a>, but to fight it he had incurred massive debt from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, who rather liked to watch him keep the Iranian regime busy for most of a decade. At the end of the 1980s he toured his creditors asking them to forgive his debts. The emir of Kuwait refused. So Saddam, his monumental ego inflated by victory over Iran, invaded Kuwait. The Americans had sided with Iraq in the late stages of the war; now the elder George Bush assembled an international coalition to push Iraq out of Kuwait. Even then, he left Saddam in power to avoid a vacuum Iran would rush to fill. His son would not be so careful.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/the-iranian-republic-we-dont-know/\" target=\"_blank\">The Iranian Republic we don&#8217;t know</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThroughout the Iran-Iraq war,\u201d Razoux said, \u201cthese were the Iranians\u2019 strategic goals: to depose Saddam Hussein; to instal Shias in power in Baghdad; and to break the Iraqi shield.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor years, Iraq had been used by the Saudis and by Turkey to create a Sunni shield state against the projection of Iranian power toward the Levant and the Mediterranean. To break the shield, you had to bring Saddam down, make the Ba\u2019ath party [the secular instrument of Saddam\u2019s power] fall, and establish a Shia regime in power in Baghdad. That\u2019s exactly what the Americans delivered on a golden platter in 2003. If I wanted to be just a little provocative, I\u2019d say the Iranians should erect a statue in George W. Bush\u2019s honour in the middle of Tehran.\u201d</p>\n<p>To tell his story, Razoux had access to an extraordinary stock of information that had eluded earlier Western investigators. Only two countries, France and Germany, kept embassies in Baghdad and Tehran running throughout the war. Razoux was able to consult memos from military attach\u00e9s in the French embassies in both capitals. But what was \u201ccolossal,\u201d he said, was his access to Saddam\u2019s office tapes. This is the first Western account of the war to make such extensive use of the materials from the Saddam audio archive.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_862919\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-862919\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST03.jpg\" alt=\"Tehran, Iran: Young schoollgirls in Islamic veils go through arms training as a Basijis (mobilized volunteer forces) while holding AK47 automatic assault rifles and standing in front of pictures of martyrs of Iran-Iraq conflict in a mosque in Tehran, 1988.

When the U.S. invaded Baghdad in 2003, Saddam\u2019s palace guard traded immunity for the tapes. The recordings showed Saddam authorizing the 1988 chemical-gas attack against Halabja, which killed up to 5,000 Iraqi Kurds. The evidence was key to the prosecution case that led to Saddam\u2019s execution, but afterward investigators kept transcribing, translating and cataloguing the tapes. They\u2019re still not done.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government gave Razoux access to thousands of pages of transcriptions. \u201cI had the feeling of being a fly on the wall, listening to all the most crucial meetings of the war. It\u2019s fascinating, because you hear another side of Saddam. Like a little boy, he keeps asking why. He had no military training. He never even did his military service. He finally asked his cousin, Adnan Khairallah, his war minister, to teach him the rudiments of warcraft. This was 18 months into the war.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/theres-a-way-to-beat-islamic-state-but-it-wont-be-pretty/\" target=\"_blank\">There\u2019s a way to beat Islamic State. But it won\u2019t be pretty.</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The war began in September 1980 with Iraqi air strikes against Iranian airbases. Saddam followed with a ground invasion. Razoux\u2019s account of the conflict\u2019s early days is a chronicle of military ineptitude on both sides. Bombers miss most of their targets, casualties are low\u2014this would not last \u2014 and neither side can gain early advantage. The Iraqi leader was astonished when Iran refused early offers to negotiate a peace. But both sides had their reasons for wanting this conflict, and both would be well into it before they started to worry about how it would end. Both regimes were new in 1980. Saddam had pushed aside his mentor, the ailing Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, to become Iraq\u2019s ruler. In Iran, an Islamist revolution had overthrown the American-backed shah. The swiftness of the Shia revolution terrified Saddam, a Sunni running a secular dictatorship in a majority-Shia country.</p>\n<p>On both sides of the border, \u201cthis was a war for internal consumption,\u201d Razoux said. Saddam wanted to warn Iran against exporting its revolution, and to establish himself as the most powerful leader in the Middle East. For Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini, the war offered a chance to break the secular parties and the various castes of <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/the-iranian-republic-we-dont-know/\" target=\"_blank\">Iranian society</a>, to rally all Iranians against Iran\u2019s traditional regional rival, Iraq.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone was wrong,\u201d Razoux said. \u201cFirst, Saddam Hussein thought his armoured divisions would be welcomed with open arms\u201d by the Arabic-speaking residents of the Khuzestan border region in southern Iran. \u201cBut they fought back. He had underestimated the power of Iranian nationalism, beyond religious divisions. That was a complete failure of calculation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Khomeini pursued the war long after he could have ended it at minimal cost, because he was sure that at some point Iraqi Shias would rise against Saddam. \u201cThere too he was completely wrong. The Iraqi Shias didn\u2019t rise up at all. Saddam had assigned the defence of key areas to Shia generals. He told them, \u2018It\u2019s your city, it\u2019s your population, it\u2019s your responsibility.\u2019 Implying it was their head that was at stake too.\u201d But the generals defended key cities like Basra fiercely, \u201cof course because their life was at stake, but also because it really was their city and it was out of the question to let it fall into the Persians\u2019 hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iraq should have lost the war. Smaller than Iran, with one-third the population, its major cities dangerously exposed\u2014Baghdad was six minutes by air from the border, Tehran much more securely protected by most of Iran\u2019s bulk\u2014its only hope depended on the advantage of surprise, which Saddam squandered. Razoux believes the key to Iran\u2019s defeat lay in events that eerily match the latest headlines today.</p>\n<p>\u201cI demonstrate that what hurt Iran most was the fall in the price of oil, between 1985 and 1988,\u201d he said. For years beginning in 1982, Ronald Reagan\u2019s vice-president, George H.W. Bush, and his CIA director, William Casey, had been travelling to Saudi Arabia to plead for increased oil production to bring the cost of a barrel of oil down. In 1985 the Saudis finally relented. A decline in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar exacerbated the effect of the plummeting oil price. Both Iran and Iraq saw their GDP fall by three-quarters.</p>\n<p>But Saddam had taken care to ensure he could fight his war on credit offered by the Gulf states, the Saudis, the Soviets and the U.S. The mullahs of Tehran had no such luck. \u201cNobody would give Iran a cent of credit.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_862915\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-862915\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Saddam Hussein with King Hussein of Jordan (Jean-Claude Francolon/Getty Images)\" width=\"822\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01-300x201.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01-768x515.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01-660x442.jpg 660w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01-680x456.jpg 680w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01-360x241.jpg 360w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01-510x342.jpg 510w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01-270x181.jpg 270w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01-537x360.jpg 537w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01-273x183.jpg 273w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01-650x436.jpg 650w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC17_WELLS_POST01.jpg 822w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Saddam Hussein with King Hussein of Jordan (Jean-Claude Francolon/Getty Images)</p></div>\n<p>Other analysts have long wondered whether the Reagan administration had something to do with the mid-\u201980s oil crash. Razoux gives the theory complete credence, on the basis of \u201ccredible sources\u201d he does not name. To some extent the Americans and Saudis were at cross purposes, he says: \u201cThe masterstroke of the Americans was to make the Saudis believe this strategy was about reining in Iran. Which was also true, but for the Americans it was a secondary concern. For them the real goal was to bring the Soviet Union to its knees.\u201d</p>\n<p>Here, perhaps, is the most eerie parallel to current events. \u201cExactly the same thing is happening today,\u201d Razoux said. A Saudi-driven oil glut has driven the price of oil down. Again he believes the Americans are behind it, with the same two targets in mind as in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe strategy is to soften Iran up for nuclear negotiations, by twisting their arm economically. And it\u2019s to punish Putin for his actions in Ukraine and Crimea. Putin played chess. Americans don\u2019t play chess, they play Monopoly. Putin moved his pieces and calculated his responses to any American move. \u2018If the Americans move against Kaliningrad, I\u2019ll do this, if they react in the Middle East I\u2019ll do that.\u2019 The Americans said, \u2018We won\u2019t play that game. We\u2019ll wage economic war.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p>This would help clear up certain enduring mysteries, if true\u2014including the reluctance of the Obama administration and its allies, including successive governments in Ottawa, to rile the oppressive <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/our-editorial-the-price-of-western-retreat-is-instability/\" target=\"_blank\">Saudi regime.</a> Razoux\u2019s analysis, and its resonance in the latest headlines, is haunting.

His answer was revealing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/multimedia/30692564.html\" target=\"_blank\">Then the local City TV guy asked Harper which vegetable he would like to be, given the choice.</a> The Conservative leader grinned, mumbled, looked down sheepishly, surveyed the vegetables behind him for an idea, and finally offered that he&#8217;d prefer to be a fruit, because then he could continue to be &#8220;sweet and colourful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This was not precisely\u00a0like the moment the other day in Waterloo, Ont., when Justin Trudeau <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-quantum-leap/\" target=\"_blank\">seized on a chance to display a basic understanding of quantum computing</a>. Harper, at least, was taken by surprise. <a href=\"http://www.jjmccullough.com/index.php/2016/04/16/the-north-koreanificiation-of-canadian-political-reporting/\" target=\"_blank\">As JJ McCullough has since pointed out,</a> Trudeau had announced to the scribes that he was hoping for a question about quantum computing, and the CP reporter quizzing him, Colin Perkel, had mentioned quantum only in passing, on his way to a Serious Question about Terrorism. Trudeau jumped on the question Perkel\u00a0hadn&#8217;t really asked\u00a0with evident glee, delivering a prepared but broadly accurate cereal-box summary of the basics of quantum computing. <a href=\"http://www.jjmccullough.com/index.php/2016/04/16/the-north-koreanificiation-of-canadian-political-reporting/\" target=\"_blank\">JJ sees this as evidence that democracy has died in Canada and the dogs of the press corps were spotted near the corpse</a>; his depiction of a monolithically complacent media party is helped along by his cheerful willingness to ignore <a href=\"http://www.chathamdailynews.ca/2016/04/15/dont-get-me-started-trudeau-delivers-impromptu-quantum-computing-lesson\" target=\"_blank\">the Canadian Press report from Perkel\u00a0himself, which described everything precisely as McCullough saw it</a>.</p>\n<p>But the issue isn&#8217;t only whether a question is set up. It is that, whenever a reporter doesn&#8217;t take a chance to force a politician into an embarrassing contradiction, that reporter is, beyond contradiction, making it a little easier for the politician to get through his day. Perkel&#8217;s\u00a0real question, about the so-called Islamic State, is a matter of public record, as is the answer Trudeau eventually gave. But I can&#8217;t tell you what either the question or the answer\u00a0was, because all I&#8217;ve heard out of Friday&#8217;s scrum was the wiffle ball on quantum computing. Trudeau&#8217;s entourage was not unhappy about this turn of events.</p>\n<p>Whenever the confrontation between politicians and reporters takes a detour into colourful anecdote, there is always a part of the audience that perceives a missed opportunity to <em>take that bastard down</em>. At that Winnipeg vegetable warehouse in 2008, Harper was making an important contribution to his highest\u00a0strategic imperative in that campaign, which was to focus attention on the dollar cost to consumers of St\u00e9phane Dion&#8217;s environmental policies. Harper&#8217;s policy edifice was rickety at best (the day&#8217;s\u00a0diesel-fuel promise would be the most expensive he made in that campaign, it made no sense at all, and after re-election he never lifted a finger to implement it). To anyone watching, and hoping he&#8217;d be taken down a peg, a goofy question about grocery-story produce must have been excruciating to watch. And of course you know Harper&#8217;s aw-shucks answer was on\u00a0every newscast that night. So Harper won the day.</p>\n<p>That was in 2008, when Harper had only been prime minister for\u00a02\u00bd years. By 2015 the tension was way higher. Joining Harper&#8217;s tour for several days just before Labour Day, I managed to put two questions to him in scrums, once in Vancouver and once in Whitehorse. The first time, I parroted the Liberal and NDP lines on deficits to him and invited him to tear their arguments apart like a Doberman, which he promptly did. On my\u00a0second turn at the microphone, I began by reminding Harper that this was my fifth time covering him in a national election campaign. He replied with some memories of his own, and there were a few seconds of banter back and forth.\u00a0It was, inevitably, a humanizing moment for a PM who had not often lately seemed very human.</p>\n<p>Such events are now routinely carried live on various Internet platforms. Both times I walked away from the microphone to find Twitter exploding with variations on, &#8220;My God, there&#8217;s Wells chatting with his buddy WHEN WILL THE MEDIA STOP PROPPING THIS GUY UP.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Perhaps, on such occasions, everyone could take a few minutes to breathe through the nose. Reporters at scrums are chasing a few different objectives, almost never in co-ordinated fashion.</p>\n<p>Some are hoping to catch a party leader in a contradiction or to force him to admit some situation is far worse than he has ever admitted before. These are the questions that begin with &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it&#8230;&#8221; Or &#8220;Why don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some have been working on an obscure story, ignored by colleagues, and it is now time to get the leader&#8217;s comment. Their questions will seem annoying but they will probably have many colleagues following them soon enough.</p>\n<p>Some reporters are simply desperate for the leader to say something fresh on a subject that hasn&#8217;t been done to death. Others have discovered that this week the only way to get any play for their stories is to pile onto a subject that <em>has</em> been done to death, even at the risk of doing it some more.</p>\n<p>Some are local reporters for whom nothing a leader says can\u00a0be as interesting as the mere fact of his presence in their community. They are likely to ask questions about vegetables or superheroes. (It is important not to generalize. Other local\u00a0reporters\u00a0will sometimes send a line drive right into the leader&#8217;s solar plexus, on shipping routes or grain prices or police budgets.)</p>\n<p>But on any given day, a scrum will probably not reduce a political leader to a quivering, weeping ruin of exposed incompetence, and to the extent that it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> deliver that result, it will frustrate viewers who were hoping for it.</p>\n<p>On the subject at hand, I do not believe anyone watching Trudeau&#8217;s scrum could reasonably conclude he is a leading thinker in the field of quantum physics. I do not believe <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-quantum-leap/\" target=\"_blank\">our coverage</a> would encourage that belief. (Full disclosure: My wife, Lisa Samson of StrategyCorp, counts the Institute for Quantum Computing among her clients. She had nothing to do with\u00a0our coverage of Trudeau&#8217;s visit.) He seemed to me like a guy who&#8217;d been briefed on the basics of the field, and had taken care to memorize the briefing, perhaps especially because it offered the chance to rebut the widespread notion that Justin Trudeau is a fool.</p>\n<p>Good for him that he takes a briefing. In 2005, speaking at the opening of the then-new Perimeter Institute building, Paul Martin waxed rhapsodic about the importance of scientific discovery while joking that he had no idea what Perimeter&#8217;s researchers were talking about. I always wished he had taken 20 minutes to get an idea. Trudeau studied for a few years after\u00a02002 at Montreal&#8217;s \u00c9cole polytechnique, where quantum mechanics is today the subject of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.polymtl.ca/etudes/cours/details.php?sigle=phs2108\" target=\"_blank\">an undergraduate course</a>, though he notes in his memoir that he dropped out after a couple of years, calling engineering &#8220;an intellectual indulgence.&#8221;\u00a0Perhaps some of it took, despite everything.</p>\n<p>I suspect Harry Truman didn&#8217;t know much about nuclear fission, or George W. Bush about the grammatical nuances\u00a0of Pashto, when they made\u00a0crucial decisions on subjects with important technical dimensions. I do not even buy the notion that such decisions are improved by having a full-time &#8220;science adviser.&#8221; I do know that, every time we take a light-hearted angle on any politician&#8217;s meeting with the press, some in our audience will mourn our culpable refusal to end that politician&#8217;s career right then and there.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/when-a-prime-minister-scrums-or-why-canadian-democracy-isnt-dead/\">When a Prime Minister scrums (Or: why democracy isn&#8217;t dead)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/when-a-prime-minister-scrums-or-why-canadian-democracy-isnt-dead/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>43</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Why the NDP&#8217;s past is never dead</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-the-ndps-past-is-never-dead/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-the-ndps-past-is-never-dead/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 16:52:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Maclean's Voices]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NDP convention 2016]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tom Mulciar]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=859961</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells on the NDP's fine balance of principles and political power</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-the-ndps-past-is-never-dead/\">Why the NDP&#8217;s past is never dead</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_860211\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-860211\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC16_WELLS_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Broadbent raises the arm of Audrey McLaughlin at the New Democratic Leadership Convention, December 1989.

(CP)</p></div>\n<p>Our text today is from William Faulkner: The past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past. The news from Edmonton is that the New Democratic Party struggled through the weekend to assay the competing claims of principle and power. But good luck finding any moment in the NDP\u2019s history when principle and power didn\u2019t define the party\u2019s main axis of division and self-doubt.</p>\n<p>In Edmonton, power was represented by the only woman in Canada who holds both an NDP card and a seat at the head of a cabinet table, <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-clash-of-memorable-speeches-first-notley-then-lewis/\" target=\"_blank\">Alberta Premier Rachel Notley</a>. (Greg Selinger in Manitoba has both of those too, but it will be a surprise if he keeps the good seat past next week\u2019s election.) She asked her party to stand for the rights of workers\u2014including those who produce fossil fuels, a notoriously legal and often valuable commodity\u2014to keep working. More broadly, she said what leaders of ideological parties always say after winning elections: that the good you can do from the sidelines is no match for the good you can do from the big chair.</p>\n<p>Principle, or at least a kind of yearning, was championed by the authors of the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-leap-manifesto-and-where-the-ndp-will-land/\" target=\"_blank\">Leap Manifesto</a>, which decries \u201cnew infrastructure projects that lock us into increased extraction decades into the future.\u201d The delegates listened to both sets of visitors and decided they want to hear more from the manifesto writers. Notley was not pleased.</p>\n<p>At some point amid the shouting, word spread that a man was down, a <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-ndp-free-at-last-to/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Thomas Mulcair</a> of Outremont, in Quebec. It was not entirely clear what he was even doing <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/the-ndps-canada-or-at-least-who-came-to-their-convention/\" target=\"_blank\">in Edmonton</a>. Some witnesses claimed that earlier he had delivered remarks to the convention, but on the central point of debate\u2014should New Democrats win elections, or should they say things that are true and beautiful, if only to one another?\u2014 his answers were not held to be useful. If you are for power, you should bring your movement closer to power. If you are for principle, you should say something memorable at least once. The crowd helped Mulcair to his feet, waited until the dazed man\u2019s senses had returned, then parted awkwardly to catch flights for home.</p>\n<p>It was all so familiar. In 1989 the NDP found itself without its leader of 14 years, Ed Broadbent. Dave Barrett, a former premier of British Columbia, ran to replace him as the candidate of power, more or less. Audrey McLaughlin ran in seeming defiance of any notion of power. She had been an MP for all of two years (twice as long, it must be said, as Barrett). She represented Yukon, a riding where coattails freeze: If she carried every seat in her home territory, the total number of seats she would carry would be one. All of this sounded wonderful to New Democrats. They made McLaughlin their leader. At the next election they won nine seats, including every seat in Yukon.</p>\n<p>Before Barrett and McLaughlin there was the Manifesto For an Independent Socialist Canada. This was in 1969 and the movement behind the manifesto was called \u201cthe Waffle,\u201d because the strangest things seemed funny in 1969. \u201cThe development of socialist consciousness\u201d must be the NDP\u2019s \u201cfirst priority,\u201d the Waffle manifesto said. By 1972 a young New Democrat named Stephen Lewis had been Ontario\u2019s provincial NDP leader for two years and was hoping to win an election. The Waffle people wouldn\u2019t stop nattering at him. He called them \u201can encumbrance around my neck.\u201d He finally ran the Waffle out of his party.</p>\n<p>These days Stephen Lewis is older and his family is at the centre of the Leap Manifesto. There is no real contradiction here. Pragmatism and principle, discipline and catharsis, contend in each of our hearts. That a man could be vexed by manifestos in his youth, only to help write them in his dotage, shows only that hope needn\u2019t wane as years pass.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/eleven-signs-that-tom-mulcair-wasnt-going-to-survive/\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Mulcair</a>, I learn, led the NDP into the 2015 federal election. At one point he ran Internet ads bragging about the party\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d to Canadians. What a peculiar word. Conspicuously mercantile: Here is the stock of goods and policies we will give you in return for your vote. Back your truck up to the loading dock. Hope dies in politics when leaders start talking about their offer. Somewhere in the middle of the mess, politics must contain a call, something that sounds like a yearning for a better world. What New Democrats said in Edmonton is that they will make compromises, absolutely, you bet. But not in return for nothing. The weekend\u2019s events amounted to an announcement that this party cannot give principles and power equal weight because it has known forever that it can live without one, and it is pretty sure it can\u2019t live without both.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-the-ndps-past-is-never-dead/\">Why the NDP&#8217;s past is never dead</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-the-ndps-past-is-never-dead/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The NDP, free at last to &#8230; ?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-ndp-free-at-last-to/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-ndp-free-at-last-to/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2016 23:29:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[leap manifesto]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NDP]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NDP convention 2016]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tom Mulcair]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=858529</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Tom Mulcair lost his party's support.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s good to aim high. In his only election as leader of the NDP, Tom Mulcair led the party to a higher share of the national popular vote than Tommy Douglas, David Lewis, Alexa McDonough and Audrey McLaughlin ever had, and higher than Jack Layton managed to win in the elections of 2004, 2006 and 2008. <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/ndp-votes-for-leadership-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Not good enough,</a> delegates to the NDP convention declared.</p>\n<p>Pack your bags, Tom: the party will reconvene in maybe two years to select a leader from among candidates Mulcair already beat in 2012, unless they prefer to pick a new leader with less experience in the federal NDP than Mulcair himself had.</p>\n<p>The new leader must be able to speak to a party with a still-relatively-large caucus of Quebec MPs, while growing its appeal where most NDP voters live, outside Quebec. The risk of getting\u00a0caught on a whipsaw of public opinion between the two language communities haunted Layton, who was born in Quebec and was wisely leery of\u00a0the debate over Quebec secession rules. The same split in allegiances finally broke Mulcair, on the question of Muslim headscarves. The next leader needs to be more agile than Layton and Mulcair were along that fault line. No candidate speaks both official languages anywhere nearly as well as Mulcair does; most aren&#8217;t close to Layton&#8217;s level of fluency.</p>\n<p>The NDP did a pretty good job of addressing the Quebec fault line this weekend by <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-leap-manifesto-and-where-the-ndp-will-land/\" target=\"_blank\">opening a new one around Alberta,</a> which contains what will be, <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/stephen-harpers-last-heroes/\" target=\"_blank\">by the spring,</a> the only provincial NDP government in the country. That government faces a jobs crisis caused by the collapse in the world price of\u00a0the commodity that got every out-of-town NDP delegate to Edmonton: Hydrocarbons. Rachel Notley would prefer that Albertans keep working. The extended Lewis family, visiting from Toronto and points south, has a better idea. Delegates did not endorse their Leap Manifesto as such, but voted to ensure the party continues to debate it while searching for a leader.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_858457\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-858457\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/11280526.jpg\" alt=\"Federal NDP Leader Tom Mulcair makes a speech during the 2016 NDP Federal Convention in Edmonton Alta, on Sunday, April 10, 2016.

(Jason Franson/CP)</p></div>\n<p>The manifesto crystallizes an eternal conflict in left-leaning parties between the right of workers to work and the right of highly educated urban literati to express their opinion about how everybody else should live. While he was leader, Layton sought to split the difference with his 2008 platform, which eschewed a broadly applied carbon tax in favour of regulation or cap-and-trade schemes that would hurt &#8220;corporations&#8221; but not their employees.</p>\n<p>A\u00a0week before last autumn&#8217;s election, a senior Mulcair adviser told me the campaign was satisfied at having neutralized the Leap Manifesto by offering as little comment on it as possible. Perhaps that was poor strategy. The NDP will now get to try it a different way.</p>\n<p>The choices the NDP made this weekend are legitimate. There is no point holding\u00a0a leadership vote and arguing that it is somehow morally wrong to vote one way or another. On policy, including Leap, the Ottawa pundit class\u2014including yours truly\u2014is the worst predictor of any idea&#8217;s electoral appeal. We are addicted to dubbing the recent consensus as &#8220;the centre&#8221; and predicting punishment for any deviation. By that measure, the victories of both Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau could not happen.</p>\n<p>So maybe alienating Rachel Notley while looking for a leader who can balance the regional tensions to which the NDP has always been prey is a <em>good</em> idea. We will soon get to find out. As will New Democrats. Their choices this weekend have the virtue of being real choices. They now need a new leader, and they have a new debate\u2014in the temporary absence of that leader\u2014that will open emotional rifts in the party membership. Making decisions is good.

That article inspired <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gmbutts/status/718059466462203905\" target=\"_blank\">vintage snark</a> from Justin Trudeau&#8217;s right hand. Now we know details of the program and they&#8217;re worth a look.</p>\n<p>The program is basically a quick-hit top-up to the money federal governments have continuously invested for nearly 20 years in university labs and fancy tech, ever since the Chr\u00e9tien government created the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI). The physical-plant revolution the CFI has wrought on campuses across the country is little short of breathtaking. Universities as dissimilar as the University of Ottawa and the University of British Columbia have been\u00a0unrecognizably transformed since 2000, as billions of dollars of your tax money have gone into new labs, conference halls, specialized technical equipment and so on.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related from macleans.ca: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/federal-budget-2016/\">Wall-to-wall coverage of the 2016 federal budget</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>As CP\u00a0reporterd, the SIF (as I&#8217;ll call this fund, for lack of a handier acronym) is designed to provide short-term economic boost by kicking that infrastructure spending into higher gear, and to provide longer-term productivity increases when those labs fill with smart people generating new ideas.</p>\n<p>On the whole, if a federal government is\u00a0looking around for ways to spend\u00a0billions of dollars, I think this is a decent place to spend them. I have long-term quibbles\u2014a lot of shiny labs have already been built, and one big question is how to pay the less-glamorous operating costs to keep\u00a0them full and productive. But a) Bill Morneau&#8217;s budget actually announced a year-long review to consider precisely such questions; and b) for institutions hoping to get some of that $2 billion, there are rather more pressing concerns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/051.nsf/eng/h_00002.html\" target=\"_blank\">Here is the program guide for SIF</a>. If you&#8217;re a research institution hoping for your share of $2 billion\u2014potentially tens of millions of taxpayer dollars you weren&#8217;t expecting before the budget came down\u2014this is your bible. Fun details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better hurry. The application deadline is May 9. That gives you four weeks to get your grant request in.</li>\n<li>You need to propose something that can be built by April 2018.</li>\n<li>Your proposal should give details on &#8220;Approval in principle by Governing Board of Institution,&#8221; which means you need to get onto the agenda of your university&#8217;s next Board of Governors meeting within, probably, the next several days; an &#8220;Engineering Design and Regulatory Approvals&#8221;; other sources of funding\u2014federal dollars will only be disbursed to institutions that can prove they have a line on $1 from somewhere else for each $1 from the feds\u2014&#8221;confirmed in writing&#8221;; an &#8220;Environmental Assessment in accordance with the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) or applicable provincial legislation&#8221;;\u00a0a detailed construction plan from the relevant contractor; and, oh, by the way, &#8220;Details, as needed, regarding Aboriginal consultations.&#8221;</li>\n<li>If all of that seems too easy, or a month sounds like way too much time to fill in these blanks, applicants are asked, as a bonus, to provide &#8220;any evidence that the project is accelerated or expanded relative to what would have occurred in the absence of SIF support.&#8221; In other words, to demonstrate that their share of the $2 billion will not simply pay for a project that would have happened anyway. Bonus marks are also offered for evidence that a proposed project will &#8220;advance Canada&#8217;s climate change and sustainability goals&#8221; or that it will &#8220;meet industry needs&#8221; or &#8220;benefit Aboriginal populations.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, again, that your application is due in a month.</p>\n<p>One final component to the fun: research institutes that &#8220;are affiliated or federated with an eligible institution&#8221; are also eligible for SIF. They were not eligible for the program the Conservatives launched in 2009 to boost university infrastructure building as part of a general economic-stimulus push by the Harper Conservatives.</p>\n<p>So. Large and unwieldy organizations that did not know this program was coming\u2014and were not, in some cases, eligible for its predecessor program and therefore could not have imagined they&#8217;d be eligible for this one\u2014have a month to make a plan, hire a contractor, woo a secondary funder, save the environment and get Indigenous blessing for some project they demonstrably were not already planning to do. If you know a research administrator at a Canadian university, polytechnic college or research park, send them a care package and be understanding if\u00a0they don&#8217;t return emails for a while.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/how-to-spend-2-billion-on-research-really-quickly/\">How to spend $2 billion on research really quickly</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/how-to-spend-2-billion-on-research-really-quickly/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Paul Wells: Europe&#8217;s breaking point</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/breaking-point-how-europe-can-still-save-itself/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/breaking-point-how-europe-can-still-save-itself/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2016 18:45:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[World]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Brussels attacks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[European Union]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Long Reads]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[longreads]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Paris attacks]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=856627</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Targeted by terror and overcome by waves of refugees\u2014a grand experiment is stumbling.

(Photograph by Timothy Fadek/Redux)</p></div>\n<p>As the list of deadly attacks grows longer, Europe\u2019s great cities have had to improvise an iconography of grief and wariness. A visitor arriving in Brussels last week, days after bombs at the airport and in the metro killed 32 people, was struck not so much by fear as by d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It was so much like Paris after the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/charlie-hebdo-then-terror-and-high-alert/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Charlie Hebdo</em> murders</a>. These things have a shape and a rhythm to them now.</p>\n<p>At the Bourse, the Belgian capital\u2019s stately old stock exchange, crowds of tourists were still laying flowers and hanging banners. Chalk inscriptions on sidewalks and on the building itself bore messages of hope or sadness or helpless banality. \u201cJust smile,\u201d said one. \u201cIt will make them angry.\u201d \u201cDiversity is Brussels and they won\u2019t take it away from us,\u201d said another.</p>\n<p>The subways were running for only 12 hours a day, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., under heavy security. As a train on the main line sped through Maelbeek station without stopping, floor-to-ceiling screens hid any view of the platforms. It was at Maelbeek that 14 people died in the second attack of March 22, an hour and 13 minutes after the bombs at the airport detonated.</p>\n<p>There were soldiers everywhere, usually working in pairs and carrying assault rifles. I passed two Belgian army regulars as I entered the Canadian Embassy on a cold spring afternoon, and it wasn\u2019t until later that I learned they were stationed there well before the latest attacks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been there since the Thalys incident,\u201d Dan Costello, Canada\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, told me. \u201cOh, no\u2014since the Verviers Ring was taken apart.\u201d</p>\n<p>It can be hard to keep up with the mayhem. Let\u2019s recap. The Thalys is a high-speed rail network that serves Brussels. On Aug. 21, 2015, a 25-year-old Moroccan, Ayoub El-Khazzani, was arrested after a man boarded the train at Brussels and began shooting and stabbing its occupants, none fatally. Four passengers, including two off-duty members of the U.S. armed forces, overpowered the assailant.</p>\n<p>Seven months earlier, on Jan. 15, 2015, Belgian police killed two men in a series of raids on houses in Verviers, in eastern Belgium, and across Brussels. The Verviers raids came eight days after gunmen in Paris killed 12 people at the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>. Police said the suspects in the raids were connected to the so-called Islamic State terror cult and that they were on the verge of planning new attacks. Investigators later said the Verviers group\u2019s ringleader, relaying orders by telephone from Athens, was Abdelhamid Abaaoud. Abaaoud remained free long enough to help organize the massive coordinated terror attack on Paris restaurants, bars and the city\u2019s main sports stadium on Nov. 11. He died in a bloody police raid in a Paris suburb a week later.</p>\n<p>Investigators believe the driver for the November Paris attacks was Salah Abdeslam, born in 1989 in Brussels to Moroccan parents. He escaped the dragnet around Paris last autumn. Police finally caught him in Molenbeek, an inner-city Brussels neighbourhood that is home to many Moroccan and Turkish immigrants. A manhunt across two countries ended on March 18 when police, alerted by a suspiciously large pizza order, raided Abdeslam\u2019s Molenbeek flat. His capture probably spurred his associates to carry out the Brussels airport and metro bombings four days later.</p>\n<p>The Verviers and Thalys incidents weren\u2019t even the beginning of Belgium\u2019s modern experience with Islamist terror, Costello reminded me. In May 2014, a gunman shot four people to death at the Jewish Museum in Brussels. Mehdi Nemmouche, an associate of the men who would later carry out the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/why-isis-is-more-dangerous-than-ever/\" target=\"_blank\">November 2015 Paris attacks</a>, was arrested after the museum attack.</p>\n<p>So just by playing connect-the-dots, in a few minutes, we had drawn links among six terror attacks in two countries that had killed more than 170 people in less than two years. No wonder there were <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/one-day-after-the-brussels-attacks-europes-new-tragic-normal-settles-in/\" target=\"_blank\">soldiers on the sidewalk</a>. \u201cI keep telling friends, this is not the Europe of our backpacking days,\u201d Costello said. \u201cThis is a new normal.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_856729\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-856729\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC15_EUROPE_POST05.jpg\" alt=\"Daily Life In Brussels After Terror Attacks.

The <em>New York Times</em> reported last week that ISIS has been operating a separate external-operations wing for two years whose plan was to carry out attacks of growing complexity and violence, in Europe, Turkey, and wherever Westerners gather around the world. At least 21 terrorists trained in Syria and returned to Europe, French intelligence sources told the <em>Times</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s a factory over there,\u201d in Syria, the <em>Times</em> quoted one arrested terror suspect, Reda Hame, a Parisian computer technician who trained in Syria with Abdelhamid Abaaoud. \u201cThey are doing everything possible to strike France, or else Europe.\u201d</p>\n<p>As you hand a shopping bag to be searched by a soldier toting an automatic rifle and wearing a scarf over half his face, wondering when or whether it will all end, it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that Europe is under siege. And it\u2019s not as though the old continent didn\u2019t have anything else to worry about. More than a million asylum seekers poured into Europe from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and the surrounding region in 2015. Early indications are that, despite increasingly frantic efforts by the European Union to discourage the exodus, more will come in 2016.</p>\n<p>Most of the newcomers are on the move precisely because they fear and loathe the destruction ISIS has caused as much as Westerners do. But many in Europe are disinclined to draw fine distinctions: the continent\u2019s ability to absorb the newcomers is under unprecedented assault, just as ISIS steps up its efforts to export the slaughter. A generally morose continental economy adds to the stress. In France, the United Kingdom and Germany, euroskeptic parties that tap into the mounting frustration have been gaining in the polls.</p>\n<p>On its eastern border, Europe faces more pressure from Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Putin. He has effectively annexed parts of Ukraine and Georgia. His air force routinely runs fake bombing raids whose flight paths seem to suggest they are rehearsals for nuclear attacks against Sweden, Estonia and other countries. And the Russian air force is pursuing inscrutable ends in Syria. Far from targeting ISIS in Syria, Russia has done a \u201cgreat deal to bolster\u201d the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad, Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, the supreme allied commander of Europe, told the House armed services committee in Washington on Feb. 25.</p>\n<p>Instead of containing or limiting the threat from ISIS, Russia has \u201cwildly exacerbated the problem,\u201d Breedlove said. Then NATO\u2019s top soldier in Europe pushed his analysis one wild step further: \u201cRussia and the Assad regime are deliberately weaponizing migration from Syria,\u201d he said, \u201cin an attempt to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>It is an extraordinary charge: that Putin is deliberately increasing the chaos in Syria to <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/charity-towards-refugees-sinks-in-the-tide-of-humanity/\" target=\"_blank\">drive waves of refugees northward</a> to break Europe. Over breakfast at a caf\u00e9 in Brussels, I put Breedlove\u2019s analysis to James Appathurai, the most senior Canadian in NATO\u2019s civilian apparatus.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s put it this way,\u201d Appathurai, a Torontonian who has been at NATO for 18 years, said. \u201cI think there are many people who would say that Putin is not necessarily interested in a strong, unified EU. And so if this has an effect of sort of confusing and weakening the European Union, or dividing it, well, that might be well in what Russia perceives to be its interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I have seen is, clearly, Russia\u2019s military activities in Syria have not been, even in the majority, directed against the Islamic State.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/syrians-fleeing-military-service-terrified-they-will-be-forced-to-return/\" target=\"_blank\">The definition of &#8216;refugee&#8217; narrows</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>So this is Europe in 2016: deliberately targeted by teams of fanatic mass murderers. Certain there will be more such attacks. Scrambling to accommodate waves of refugees. Wearied by a crisis of faith in a continent-wide experiment, the European Union, whose principles of open markets and open borders are contested by populist parties in every major European democracy. And prodded from the east and perhaps the south by Putin, whose nostalgia for the old Soviet Union is matched only by his inventiveness in coming up with new ways to torment Europe.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_856727\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-856727\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC15_EUROPE_POST04.jpg\" alt=\"Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with French Senate President Gerard Larcher (not pictured) in the Kremlin on April 5, 2016 in Moscow, Russia.

He emphasized that on this question, he wasn\u2019t talking in any formal capacity as a NATO spokesman but simply as a long-time resident of Brussels. \u201cWhat I hear everyone saying, except for hard-core europhiles, is average people say maybe we need to give open borders a break.\u201d In public opinion polls in a handful of countries, majorities favour limits on the so-called Schengen Agreement, which allows anyone to travel anywhere within continental Europe without stopping at border crossings. \u201cSo, Schengen, it was nice, maybe one day again, but now we need to control our borders.\u201d</p>\n<p>The second effect Appathurai described is the rise of all those far-right parties: France\u2019s National Front, the UK Independence Party, the Alternative for Germany, and so on. Basically all of those parties favour freezes on immigration, national control over borders, and a slam on the brakes of the EU\u2019s 50-year project of ever-closer integration among member states. In an unlucky coincidence, a series of votes over the next year will give voters a series of chances to cast judgment on the EU\u2019s fate.</p>\n<p>The first big test will be on June 23, when the United Kingdom will hold a referendum on whether to stay in the EU. The vote was Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s brainchild, a re-election campaign commitment in 2015. He is campaigning for a No vote that would keep Britain in the EU. But his Conservative party is divided on the question, and recent polls make it far from clear which side will win. A victory for the anti-EU forces would cripple Cameron\u2019s career and boost the fortunes of Nigel Farage and his anti-immigration UKIP.</p>\n<p>Next up will be national elections in Germany and France in 2017. France\u2019s Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is a dithering nonentity who tried his best to step up to the challenge of statecraft after the Paris terror attacks of January and November last year. But he falls consistently behind Marine Le Pen of the National Front in most presidential election polls, which means that in a three-way race against Le Pen and a centre-right candidate, he wouldn\u2019t even make it to the second round of voting for his own re-election.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_856723\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-856723\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC15_EUROPE_POST02.jpg\" alt=\"French President Francois Hollande (R) welcomes German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L) prior a meeting with Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (unseen) during an European Union leaders summit over migration in Brussels, Belgium, March 17, 2016.

(Stephane de Sakutin/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>In Germany it is hard to imagine national politics without <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/merkel-sticks-to-migrant-course-after-german-state-elections/\" target=\"_blank\">Angela Merkel</a>. She hasn\u2019t yet announced whether she will seek a fourth term as chancellor next year. But her electoral support has grown shaky. She is closely identified with her government\u2019s generous attitude toward welcoming migrants. Her reputation was badly hurt by a string of New Year\u2019s Eve sexual attacks against women in Cologne. Police said the 58 men who were arrested were mostly of Algerian, Moroccan or Tunisian descent, although only three were recent immigrants. Whether she runs again or not, the 2017 German election seems sure to be a referendum on Merkel\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p>Squat and boring, Brussels is a perfect petri dish for all of these pathologies. I have visited the city often over the years, never for longer than necessary. As Belgium\u2019s capital it expresses, in a hundred ways, the uneasy alliance of mutual suspicion between residents of the country\u2019s two largest communities, the French-speaking Wallonia and the Dutch-speaking Flanders.</p>\n<p>Belgian governments are notoriously delicate things, rickety alliances of conflicting personalities from many wee regional parties. In 2010 and 2011 the country went 589 days with no national government at all. Every few weeks somebody would visit the King with some harebrained scheme and be sent back to the drawing board. Nobody paid the extended crisis any particular mind. It is illegal for the police to raid anyone\u2019s house between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m., more or less because each language community has always been sure the other side would invade their houses. The massive office buildings of the EU have, in stages over the last half-century, simply been plopped down onto central Brussels. Much of it was built by waves of immigrant labour from the Mediterranean\u2014Italians at first, then Moroccans and Turks.</p>\n<p>They all live together in zones and layers of mutual incomprehension. The rules and fractured jurisdictions certainly slowed down police as they attempted to find the Paris attackers in Brussels.</p>\n<p>Late last year, Belgium\u2019s justice minister said Salah Abdeslam escaped a police raid in Brussels two days after the November Paris massacres because of the archaic night-raid ban. Police were sure they had Abdeslam when they knocked off for the night, but when they returned the next morning, he was gone.</p>\n<p>The eventual arrest of Abdeslam didn\u2019t help police foil the attacks by his accomplices four days later. Two cabinet ministers offered their resignations over the mess. Charles Michel, who has managed to hang on as prime minister for almost 18 months, rejected the resignations. Tim King, a British journalist who wrote a widely read article last year calling Belgium a \u201cfailed state,\u201d told me that nobody may resign from a Belgian government because the layers of faction make it almost impossible to replace anyone. \u201cIf somebody resigns, it just messes up the whole maths of the federal government.\u201d</p>\n<p>After the March 22 attacks, American television news cameras descended on Molenbeek, where Abdeslam was arrested, and depicted it as a den of Islamist fundamentalism where outsiders tread in fear. In fact it\u2019s a mostly unremarkable working-class neighbourhood, densely populated, notoriously prone to petty crime. The largest building near the main square is a police station. Molenbeek is, in fact, more like the rest of Brussels than unlike it: everybody minds their own business. \u201cYou don\u2019t squeal on the neighbours,\u201d King told me. \u201cYou keep yourself to yourself.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_856731\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-856731\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC15_EUROPE_POST06.jpg\" alt=\"Daily Life In Brussels After Terror Attacks.

(Photograph by Timothy Fadek/Redux)</p></div>\n<p>The Belgian police need to get their act together. The EU needs to improve its intelligence-gathering. But the kind of pop sociology that would pin blame for the Brussels attacks on Belgian federalism misses an important point, which is that ISIS and its lone-wolf disciples have struck in a growing number of very different countries: France, whose police have taken Islamist terrorism seriously for 30 years. Tunisia. Turkey. The United States, where neither border controls beyond the wildest dreams of euroskeptic parties nor all the wiles of the FBI could stop Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a U.S. citizen and a permanent resident, from killing 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., before police shot them dead last December.</p>\n<p>Arnaud Danjean is a fast-rising young centre-right French politician, a member of the European Parliament who was on a metro train that rode through Maelbeek station only a few minutes before the bomb on another train exploded on March 22. In an interview, he politely refused an invitation to be introspective about his near miss, pointing out that dozens of others were not so fortunate. Before he was a politician he was a member of France\u2019s security services, with stints in the Balkans and Afghanistan to his credit.</p>\n<p>He told me Belgium suffers from \u201ca less than optimal functioning\u201d of its security apparatus, pausing to chuckle at his own understatement. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to condemn Belgium, because no European state has a system that\u2019s infallible. Take France\u2019s case. It seems to me that France doesn\u2019t do enough self-criticism. France has too quickly blamed Belgium, and there\u2019s something to that, but France can\u2019t spare itself some self-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p>I thought Danjean might be arguing, as I have in the past, that entire communities of long-term immigrants are shut out of the mainstream culture and economy of many countries, France certainly included. He wasn\u2019t buying the argument. His answer made me reconsider. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should exaggerate the social character of this phenomenon. In France, among radicalized people, we find that 40 per cent are converts. So that relativizes the social approach, if you will.\u201d</p>\n<p>It sure does. Why do people with a stake in European civil society convert, in many cases not to any mainstream Islam but to the desolate and murderous strain of Wahhabism advertised by ISIS? Conversely, why do the vast majority of Muslims in the Paris <em>banlieues</em> and in <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/how-brussels-became-europes-extremist-haven/\" target=\"_blank\">Molenbeek</a> continue to lead peaceable lives?</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/after-paris-the-new-war-on-terror/\" target=\"_blank\">After Paris comes the new war on terror</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The best answer I have seen lately comes from Olivier Roy, a French political scientist. After 2015\u2019s second massacre in Paris he published an article in <em>Le Monde</em> arguing that Islamist terror \u201cis the only thing on the market of radical rebellion.\u201d Earlier generations killed for anarchy, or Communism. \u201cThe rallying cry of these youth is opportunistic,\u201d Roy wrote. \u201cToday it is the Islamic State; yesterday, they were with al-Qaeda; before that, in 1995, they were subcontractors for the Algerian Armed Islamic Group, or they practiced the nomadism of personal jihad, from Bosnia to Afghanistan, by way of Chechnya. Tomorrow they will fight under another banner, so long as combat death, age, or disillusion do not empty their ranks.\u201d</p>\n<p>The great thing about ISIS, besides its licence to kill, is its very limited homework requirement, Roy wrote. The young fighters who move to Syria are under no obligation to meet the neighbours, learn any history, or do anything but train to perpetuate the jihad. \u201cIn Syria, they only fight war; none integrate or interest themselves in civil society. And if they take sexual slaves or recruit young women on the Internet to become the wives of future martyrs, it\u2019s because they are in no way socially integrated in the Muslim societies that they claim to defend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not, then, the radicalization of Islam,\u201d Roy wrote, \u201cbut the Islamization of radicalism.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_853629\" style=\"width: 883px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-853629\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MAC14_LETTERFROMEUROPE_POST02_b.jpg\" alt=\"Two men in the Molenbeek district, a neglected inner-city area of Brussels in economic decline, Jan. 25, 2015.

(Andrew Testa/The New York Times)</p></div>\n<p>All of which suggests, to me, that the long-term solution to the urban terror of ISIS is not to shut down borders, banish newcomers, bulk up the surveillance state and out-tough the murderers. Certainly there is a market for that prescription. On a Monday night several days after the Brussels bombings, a gang of thick-necked soccer hooligans descended on the square in front of the Bourse, tearing down peacenik banners and picking fights with passersby who seemed, in the eye of the roving strongmen, excessively eager to make nice with Islamists. The police finally saw the counterprotesters off with water cannon. There will be plenty of politicians offering the marchers their brand of tough medicine in the next election, in Belgium and across Europe. There have been for decades.</p>\n<p>But if Islamism is vying for the attention and affection of distracted and dissolute kids, whether second-generation rebel sons of moderate Muslims or slapdash converts from Christianity or atheism, then it is not in the West\u2019s long-term interest to try to out-tough the killers. Rather it is to sap the appeal of terror and murder by ensuring, consistently over the long term, that another way of life really does look better.</p>\n<p>On that score, I daresay that Europe, for all its strains and its frequent inanity, is doing well. On a bad day you could almost sell the notion that EU and ISIS are funhouse-mirror images of each other: polyglot, border-skipping multinational operations that operate in defiance of history, logic or human nature. But the comparison flatters ISIS and cheats Europe. The foreign fighters who have streamed to Raqqa to join the jihad have as often recoiled in horror as they have been embraced as useful recruits. The murders of innocent dozens in Paris, including Muslims, have badly undercut the appeal of ISIS in the French-speaking world. C\u00e9dric Mas, a French analyst, has pointed out that the latest issue of <em>Dar al-Islam</em>, the French-language ISIS propaganda magazine, devotes an unprecedented amount of space to defensive arguments for its terror attacks in Europe\u2014and contains no long-term forecasts about the organization\u2019s future. It is as if, at the moment of its apparent triumph, ISIS has found itself thrown on the back foot among its own clientele.</p>\n<p>Europe, meanwhile, is Europe, revelling in its history and culture, refining its admittedly clumsy policing, learning from error. And not incidentally, living as a rich, compelling community\u2014richer in many places, in important ways, than Brussels.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/with-the-attacks-on-brussels-europes-crisis-of-competence-boils-over/\" target=\"_blank\">Europe&#8217;s crisis of competence boils over</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>On Monday at a conference organized by the European Policy Centre think tank, Thomas Fabian, the deputy mayor of Leipzig, described the policies his German city of 500,000 people has adopted to integrate the more than 5,000 migrants who moved there last year. The newcomers are distributed throughout the city, including in affluent neighbourhoods, instead of being left in ghettos, Fabian said. The newcomers are obliged to take German lessons. Each family is assigned a city social worker to check in now and again, but for the most part newcomers are encouraged to leave their homes to visit doctors and other services, to strengthen their personal responsibility and self-reliance. The goal of it all, Fabian said, is to make sure the newcomers join Leipzig\u2019s broader community, a community whose residents, 300 years ago, included Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>\n<p>This is a better way to act. It is more fulfilling and will, over time, be more attractive. By coincidence I arrived in Brussels on the same Thalys train route, from Amsterdam through Brussels to Paris, on which three vacationing Americans subdued Ayoub El-Khazzani eight months ago. No guard rifled through my bag as I boarded, and the train did not stop at the border between the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>\n<p>In my car was an American family. The mother read aloud to her three sons from a <em>Harry Potter</em> book for the duration of the two-hour trip. A society where family, community, technology and security can co-exist that well\u2014most of the time, never perfectly\u2014is stronger than it looks. Stronger than it has been made to feel this year. In the long-term battle between Europe and its assorted tormenters, keep betting on Europe.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/breaking-point-how-europe-can-still-save-itself/\">Paul Wells: Europe&#8217;s breaking point</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/breaking-point-how-europe-can-still-save-itself/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>7</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The case for nasty, dirty, evil deficits</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-case-for-nasty-dirty-evil-deficits/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-case-for-nasty-dirty-evil-deficits/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2016 18:48:33 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Economic analysis]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill Morneau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[federal budget 2016]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[liberal party of canada]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=853429</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells explains why budget debate should not be about spending alone</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-case-for-nasty-dirty-evil-deficits/\">The case for nasty, dirty, evil deficits</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_851079\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-851079\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/BUDGET_POST04.jpg\" alt=\"Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (L) and Finance Minister Bill Morneau walk to the House of Commons to deliver the budget on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, March 22, 2016.

(Patrick Doyle,\u00a0Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>We are having to get used to some new ideas in Ottawa. Bill Morneau brought down the first <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/federal-budget-2016/\">budget</a> of the second, cuddlier Trudeau era the other day, and\u2014wait, is this the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/from-one-trudeau-budget-to-another/\">second</a> Trudeau era? Perhaps it\u2019s the third. After all, Joe Clark\u2019s nine months in office divided Pierre Trudeau\u2019s tenure into a first, long stint, from 1968 to 1979, and a shorter burst from 1980 to 1984. That sequel was all killer, no filler: it included victory in the first Quebec secession referendum, a rewritten Constitution and a world peace tour. (Actual world peace came later. In fact we\u2019re still waiting. But the Cold War ended six years after Pierre Trudeau\u2019s peace tour, so, you know, there you have it.)</p>\n<p>But I digress. The broad outlines of <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sunny-ways-half-measures/\">the first Morneau budget</a> are well known: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/business/welcome-back-to-the-age-of-big-government-in-canada/\">Billions</a> for public infrastructure, billions for health and education in Indigenous communities, taxes down over here but up over there, and <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/canada-is-adrift-without-a-fiscal-anchor/\">a whopping deficit.</a> To be followed by years of more whopping deficits in years to come. Those deficits, and the context in which they are being incurred, are <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/how-the-liberals-could-balance-the-budget-if-they-have-the-will/\">one of the big stories</a> out of this budget.</p>\n<p>But another is subtler, and seems healthy. Two of the big programs in a budget full of big programs are strongly means-tested, which means you get more benefit the lower your income. This is true for <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/what-students-should-know-about-the-federal-budget/\">aid to students,</a> because enhanced Canada Student Grants will go, disproportionately, to the lowest-income students; and because a new income cutoff will ensure that no graduate who isn\u2019t earning at least $25,000 a year will be required to repay student loans.</p>\n<p>More significantly, it\u2019s true of the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/child-care-benefit-as-promised/\">Canada Child Benefit,</a> which pays sharply declining amounts as incomes climb beyond what could reasonably be called middle-class. If your income is high enough you don\u2019t get any benefit at all.</p>\n<p>This program design breaks a taboo that never made sense to me. It\u2019s often argued that social programs must be universal because the rich won\u2019t pay, through their taxes, for programs that don\u2019t benefit them. So for years I\u2019ve heard arguments for lower university tuition. Even though plenty of people can afford to pay any price for university. Even though their money would help improve access for others. And when Trudeau argued against a universal child benefit, both Stephen Harper and Tom Mulcair criticized him.</p>\n<p>Now we will see if support for family benefits collapses now that not every family gets a benefit. I suspect it won\u2019t.</p>\n<p>The budget\u2019s big deficits\u2014nearly $30 billion this year, falling to $14 billion at the end of the Liberals\u2019 mandate, assuming they don\u2019t come up with any new spending ideas\u2014received much more attention. The size of the deficits blows a Liberal campaign promise to shreds, as does the news that Trudeau has no intention of balancing the budget before he faces the voters again. This is what many people, including Stephen Harper, said would happen: that when Justin Trudeau promised a more active government and, eventually, a balanced budget, he really only meant the first part.</p>\n<p>The early budget coverage suggested a string of deficits will lead where strings of deficits led in the \u201980s and \u201990s: to an accumulated debt that, if it had continued snowballing, would have been unsustainable. It took a few days for observers, including the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/we-are-not-heading-to-fiscal-crisis/\">University of British Columbia economist Kevin Milligan,</a> to do the math. Federal government debt as a fraction of the economy is <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/the-truth-about-slippery-slopes-debt-bombs-and-deficit-hawks/\">half of what it used to be.</a> Interest rates, which increase the cost of carrying debt, are comically low. (Provincial debt isn\u2019t cause for immediate concern either: where it\u2019s highest, in Quebec and Ontario, it\u2019s finally started to decline.) Deficits on the scale of Trudeau\u2019s are sustainable for many years to come\u2014unless interest rates spike, in which case we\u2019ll be into the soup again, but let us not borrow trouble.</p>\n<p>The whole point of balancing the budget in the \u201990s was that politics, understood as a debate over the cost and ambition of government, had become impossible. The kind of government many Liberals wanted was unaffordable because the cost of servicing that jumbo debt crowded out other uses. The goal of those first epic Paul Martin budgets was to get back to a point where the role of government could be the subject of healthy debate, because both a leaner government and a more active government were at least feasible. The debate could be on the merits.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the situation Justin Trudeau has inherited. Gushers of new spending will offer both benefits\u2014better roads, cleaner water\u2014and dangers. The sponsorship scandal of the late Chr\u00e9tien years was possible because it was obvious to every scoundrel with Liberal friends that spending on national unity would not receive close scrutiny from a government that was desperate to be seen doing something on the file. A government that considers the scale of its spending to be proof of its virtue is an easy mark for hucksters and worse.</p>\n<p>So a more active government won\u2019t always be wise. But its activism is sustainable. Which means the political debate will have to be over the wisdom of all this spending, not the mere fact of it. It\u2019s a new time.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-case-for-nasty-dirty-evil-deficits/\">The case for nasty, dirty, evil deficits</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-case-for-nasty-dirty-evil-deficits/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>15</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Sunny ways, half measures</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sunny-ways-half-measures/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sunny-ways-half-measures/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2016 20:12:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill Morneau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[federal budget 2016]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[liberal party of canada]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=850111</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells on the work not done in the 2016 federal budget </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sunny-ways-half-measures/\">Sunny ways, half measures</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\n        <meta itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"PT1M22S\" />\n        <meta itemprop=\"thumbnailUrl\" content=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/tile-wells-150x150.jpg\" />\n        <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Sunny ways, half measures\" />\n        <meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Paul Wells on the work not done in the 2016 federal budget \" />\n        <meta itemprop=\"uploadDate\" content=\"2016-03-22T16:12:54+00:00\" />\n    \n    <div style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//admin.brightcove.com/js/api/SmartPlayerAPI.js\"></script>\n\n    <object id=\"myExperience4812772386001\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\">\n        <param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" />\n        <param name=\"width\" value=\"822\" />\n        <param name=\"height\" value=\"462\" />\n        <param name=\"playerID\" value=\"781201057001\" />\n        <param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAAAyz2WOE~,aVUQ6mHrguBSuSrVFuMzlGsPf_mMTNMB\" />\n        <param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"onTemplateLoad\" />\n        <param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"onTemplateReady\" />\n        <param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4812772386001\" />\n                <param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&amp;iu=%2F7326%2Frogers.publishing%2Fmacleans.CPGBusiness%2Fvideos&amp;ciu_szs=728x90%2C300x250&amp;impl=s&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;env=vp&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;ad_rule=1&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;cmsid=1464\" />\n                <param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sunny-ways-half-measures/\" />\n        <param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" />\n    </object>\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    brightcove.createExperiences();\n</script>\n\n<p>You know, the longer Stephen Harper isn\u2019t prime minister, the longer he isn\u2019t prime minister. Every new government cheerfully consigns some of its predecessor\u2019s work to the memory hole; the Trudeau Liberals, persuaded that the work of Harper\u2019s life was to bury their party and its works, have set about returning the favour. Farewell then, Children\u2019s Fitness Tax Credit and Children\u2019s Arts Tax Credit. Bye-bye, cuts to veterans\u2019 benefits. Hello again, Court Challenges Program and Katimavik.</p>\n<p>I ran into a CBC employee who was amazed by the scale of new taxpayer investment in his shop ($150 million a year, $675 million over the budget\u2019s five-year horizon). If you hate the CBC, there\u2019ll be lots more to hate under Justin Trudeau. But then, you probably voted Conservative, so we don\u2019t hear you, <em>neener neener neener.</em></p>\n<p>Stephen Harper didn\u2019t talk to the provinces? Trudeau and his ministers will talk their faces off with the provinces. I borrowed an electronic copy of the budget on a USB stick and ran a text search; this budget commits Team Trudeau to \u201cwork with provinces and territories\u201d on Canada Student Grants; on a flat-rate student contribution; on labour-market training; on labour-market information; on green infrastructure; on a national housing strategy; on an early learning and childcare framework; on an innovation agenda; on a Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund; on a \u201cCluster Mapping portal\u201d; on a \u201cFramework on Clean Growth and Climate Change\u201d; on infrastructure for alternative transport fuels; on an enhanced Canada Pension Plan; on a multi-year health accord; on gang violence (they\u2019re against it, or at least the feds are, I mean, I don\u2019t want to presume anything before the talks with the provinces start); on heavy urban search and rescue; and on some other stuff. You get the picture. Federalism: More, please.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/is-trudeaus-honeymoon-over-the-budgets-grim-economic-vision/\" target=\"_blank\">John Geddes on the budget sting after Trudeau&#8217;s honeymoon</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Taken piece by piece, there are not a lot of surprises here. Trudeau campaigned, and has governed, in a way that left little room for surprises. There was a lot of stuff in his platform. Each minister received detailed orders to deliver on a share of those plans, in the form of specific instructions in public mandate letters. The budget allocates dollars to tick off those boxes. Because there were a lot of boxes, there are a lot of dollars. The biggest-ticket items\u2014about $10 billion over two years for an enhanced Canada Child Benefit and a comparable amount for infrastructure spending\u2014are no surprise at all.</p>\n<p>What is more of a surprise is the abandonment of any pretense of restraint in the box-ticking. The spending taps are wide open, and what\u2019s your problem? Trudeau ran last fall against two glum budget-balancers, Harper and Tom Mulcair. He alone promised deficits\u2014wee ones, $10 billion a year, vanishing by the time he would face voters again. And he won the election.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take Trudeau long after the election to jettison that pesky $10-billion cap, given the daunting magnitude of the challenges facing the nation. But as recently as his year-end town hall meeting with <em>Maclean\u2019s</em> in December, he was still adamant that he\u2019d reduce the deficit to zero by the time he next faced the electorate, probably in 2019. Besides, he said, hefty doses of \u201cstimulus\u201d are sustainable as long as the size of the accumulated federal debt continues to decline as a fraction of the total economy.</p>\n<p>Trudeau came out of the election, to sum up, with three tests of fiscal virtue: a $10-billion total annual deficit cap; a return to balanced budgets before the next election; and a constantly declining debt-to-GDP ratio. He didn\u2019t take long at all to dump the first condition. With this budget he has now abandoned the second, and the third hangs by a thread. Never mind the $29.4-billion deficit Bill Morneau predicts for this year; what\u2019s daunting is the $17.8-billion deficit he projects for 2019-20, the next election year. No wonder the word \u201cdeficit\u201d does not appear at any point in Morneau\u2019s budget speech. It\u2019s hard to know how to say some things.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/business/welcome-back-to-the-age-of-big-government-in-canada/\" target=\"_blank\">Welcome back to the age of big government in Canada</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Ah, but the debt-to-GDP ratio. It ends, in Morneau\u2019s little chart, at 30.9 per cent of GDP in 2020-21, having begun at 31 per cent\u00a0in 2014-15. That\u2019s a decline. It\u2019s totally a decline. But the number goes on a little journey on its way to that smaller-by-a-sliver end point. It peaks at 32.6 per cent\u00a0in 2016-17 and doesn\u2019t fall back below its starting point for another four years. By 2021, Morneau projects the Trudeau government will have added $113 billion to the federal debt. That\u2019s almost as much as Harper added, but Harper was in office for twice as long.</p>\n<p>I am conscious of being a spoilsport. Why all this navel-gazing over debt? Big-city mayors, university presidents, provincial premiers and Aboriginal leaders will be beaming with delight at this budget\u2019s largesse. In a few narrow domains I keep an eye on, there is much to admire. Post-secondary student aid is targeted at the neediest recipients, not wasted on the rich. New money for science research granting councils is un-targeted, and there\u2019s a promise to spend the next year \u201cexamin[ing] the rationale for current targeting\u201d of federal science funding. It\u2019s possible to hope for a future in which scientists spend more time doing science and less writing grant applications. I don\u2019t even mind all that consulting with the provinces on all those other files I listed above: it\u2019s usually a good idea for different levels of government to check each other\u2019s work.</p>\n<p>But this budget is built a little wonky because, precisely by the assumptions Justin Trudeau is bringing into government, it leaves work undone. If your goal is to undo the Harper legacy, you can\u2019t undo only half of it. Morneau projects much higher spending than Harper at unchanged revenue levels. He\u2019s hoping economic growth will pick up enough to cover the gap. If it does, no harm done, and it\u2019s reasonable to expect a second term for this government after the next election.</p>\n<p>But I\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t order up a growth boom the way you call for a pizza, which means that at some point those deficits and that debt will start to look like a problem. Then Bill Morneau or his successor will need those missing revenues. At that point, reversing one more element of the Harper legacy will be nearly unavoidable.

REUTERS/Michalis Karagiannis</p></div>\n<p>\u201cIt might be nice if [the U.S.] paid a little more attention to the world,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the other day <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/five-takeaways-from-justin-trudeaus-60-minutes-segment/\" target=\"_blank\">on </a><em><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/five-takeaways-from-justin-trudeaus-60-minutes-segment/\" target=\"_blank\">60 Minutes</a>. </em>\u201cHaving a little more of an awareness of what\u2019s going on in the rest of the world, I think is, is what many Canadians would hope for Americans.\u201d</p>\n<p>In that spirit, let\u2019s you and I pay a little more attention to the world.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s concentrate on Europe, which is in some danger of bursting over the influx of refugees from <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/michael-ignatieff-gets-it-very-wrong-on-syria/\" target=\"_blank\">Syria</a> and other countries. The numbers involved are staggering, and can at times be difficult to hear over the sound of self-congratulation on this side of the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>Yes, Canada has<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/john-mccallum-marks-arrival-of-25000-syrian-refugees/\" target=\"_blank\"> accepted more than 26,000 refugees</a>. It has been a compelling display of Canada\u2019s generosity and openness. I have met no European official who has anything but praise for Canada\u2019s effort. Meanwhile there are three million refugees in Turkey. In January alone, about 70,000 migrants entered Greece along the so-called eastern Mediterranean route. In 2015, about 885,000 people entered the European Union along that route. Most of them continued northward from Greece and into the rest of the continent.</p>\n<p>For much of last year, Europe was divided between advocates of openness and welcome, and proponents of a harder line. The leader of the former group was Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany. An important ally was Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who is now the president of the European Council and therefore, perhaps, the most important unelected official in the European Union. I use the past tense here because the advocates of openness are close to giving up. It is hard to impose a moral judgment on this choice; the crush of human numbers has done the work.</p>\n<p>Last September, the day after little <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/inside-the-tragedy-that-woke-up-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Kurdi</a>\u2019s corpse washed up on a Greek beach, Hungary\u2019s populist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, published an op-ed in a German newspaper calling for Europe to defend itself against the waves of migrants. \u201cMost of them are not Christians, but Muslims,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIs it not worrying in itself that European Christianity is now barely able to keep Europe Christian?\u201d</p>\n<p>That same day, Tusk met with Orb\u00e1n in Brussels. Standing next to Orb\u00e1n as they met reporters, Tusk lectured his guest on the meaning of Christian charity. \u201cChristianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice. For a Christian it shouldn\u2019t matter what race, religion and nationality the person in need represents.\u201d</p>\n<p>I was very much #TeamTusk in that dispute, so it has been fascinating to watch the Pole as he realizes Europe is failing to resettle migrants in large numbers. Last spring, as it became clear 2015 would be the biggest year ever for migrant arrivals in Europe, the European Council hatched a plan to send 40,000 migrants from Italy and Greece to other European Union member states. By September it was obvious this was far too small a number, and the target was quadrupled to 160,000. Some of the relocated migrants would come from Hungary, to take pressure off and calm Orb\u00e1n.</p>\n<p>Six months later, 660 migrants have been moved out of Italy, Greece and Hungary to the rest of Europe. Bulgaria has taken two, Spain 18. The relocation program isn\u2019t working.</p>\n<p>Hence the recent change in Tusk\u2019s tone. \u201cI want to appeal to all potential illegal economic migrants, wherever you are from: Do not come to Europe,\u201d he said in Athens at the beginning of this month. \u201cDo not risk your lives and your money. It is all for nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now, it\u2019s worth noting that he intended this message only for people who enter Europe looking for better jobs. Most of the migrants are legitimate refugees fleeing for their lives. But it can be hard, under the crush of numbers, to tell the difference. And the rules are quickly changing for everyone.</p>\n<p>Lately Tusk has hoped to buy peace by sending tens of thousands of migrants back to Turkey\u2014outside the EU\u2019s borders\u2014in return for billions of euros in EU resettlement funding. The Turks have no trouble spotting a desperate customer. This week, Ahmet Davutoglu, the country\u2019s prime minister, upped the ante. He wants $8.8 billion for resettlement, double the previous offer. He wants the EU to be a visa-free zone for Turks by June. And he wants Turkey\u2019s application to join the EU fast-tracked. Taken together it would be sweet reward for a regime that, only last week, seized control of Turkey\u2019s largest newspaper, replaced its critical staff with lapdogs, and pelted protesters with rubber bullets and tear gas. Normally the EU frowns on such behaviour. This month it hasn\u2019t the luxury.</p>\n<p>The lead negotiator on the EU side for the deal with Turkey was Angela Merkel. Last year she staked her career on keeping Europe open to newcomers. This year she is <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/merkels-party-calls-for-stricter-laws-on-asylum-seekers/\" target=\"_blank\">trying to save her skin</a>, and Europe\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Canadian officials have had little to say about any of this. Last month, Foreign Affairs Minister St\u00e9phane Dion was in Turkey, hoping his hosts might be in the mood to buy Bombardier C-series jetliners. Perhaps the Turks found the distraction amusing.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/charity-towards-refugees-sinks-in-the-tide-of-humanity/\">Charity towards refugees sinks in the tide of humanity</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/charity-towards-refugees-sinks-in-the-tide-of-humanity/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Justin Trudeau takes Ottawa&#8217;s debates to Washington</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-takes-ottawas-debates-to-washington/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-takes-ottawas-debates-to-washington/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2016 20:52:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Trudeau in Washington 2016]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=846283</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>'It\u2019s me sitting here as Prime Minister of Canada, not Stephen Harper.'</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-takes-ottawas-debates-to-washington/\">Justin Trudeau takes Ottawa&#8217;s debates to Washington</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_846299\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-846299\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MAC13_MARCH11_TRUDEAUDC_WELLS_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at the Canada 2020 and the Center for American Progress luncheon gathering in Washington, Friday, March 11, 2016.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)</p></div>\n<p>Critics of Justin Trudeau\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/trudeau-in-washington-2016/\">three-day trip to Washington</a> have an obvious point: the Prime Minister didn\u2019t make much of a dent in the wall-to-wall coverage of the U.S. presidential primaries, and especially of Donald Trump\u2019s amazing candidacy. But often during this trip, it seemed Trudeau\u2019s admirers also had a hard time viewing him through any lens but the primaries.</p>\n<p>Every time <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/for-the-record-wheres-the-stanley-cup-right-now/\">Trudeau took questions</a>\u2014from reporters on Thursday in the White House Rose Garden, Friday from preternaturally well-briefed students at the American University\u2014he was asked specifically about Trump. Usually the questions were awkwardly jokey, and more than once they were about the notion that Americans might flee northward at the prospect of a Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>(President Barack Obama jumped on that question the first time it was asked, before Trudeau could speak, and reminded everyone that the that-does-it-I\u2019m-moving-to-Canada folktale had featured in commentary around his own election in 2008, and indeed in most recent presidential contests. By Friday, Trudeau was giving a version of the same argument himself.)</p>\n<p>But more generally, Trudeau\u2019s assorted gentle interrogators often seemed to value him because he offers evidence that voters won\u2019t always select the angriest candidate or the one who shouts the loudest. At American University, whose school for international service was founded in response to an Eisenhower speech urging Americans to \u201cwage peace,\u201d most of the questions were variations on: &#8220;You\u2019re so cool. How did you get to be so cool?&#8221; The presence of Indigenous MPs and Sikhs in his cabinet was lauded, as was his commitment to gender parity, his policy of accepting 25,000 Syrian refugees, and other policies that would perhaps not normally be endorsed by a president Trump.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related from macleans.ca: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-washington-lobby-day/\">Justin Trudeau&#8217;s lobby day in Washington</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Trudeau was eager to second these emotions, and to offer up a succession of sometimes shopworn odes to inclusiveness. But twice at a lunch organized by the very Liberal-friendly Ottawa think tank Canada 2020 and by its Washington counterpart, the Center for American Progress, I thought Trudeau pushed the argument to intriguing lengths.</p>\n<p>First, on the Syrian refugees. Welcoming all those newcomers isn\u2019t only \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d Trudeau said. It\u2019s also in Canada\u2019s longer-term self-interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s also about strengthening our communities,\u201d he said. \u201cBringing over families who will get jobs and build and create and contribute and create better futures for their kids than they could have anywhere else in the world, or certainly than they could have back home. And therefore with their hard work, with their delight at the opportunities we\u2019re handing them, they\u2019re going to boost our economy as well, and remind us and give us a better perspective on the world that will be very useful in the coming years. Canadians got that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Indeed, even the Conservatives\u2014whom Trudeau insisted on calling \u201cour right wing\u201d throughout his remarks, perhaps to spare American listeners the burden of remembering more than one party label\u2014did not offer significant resistance to Trudeau\u2019s refugee policy after the election. \u201cI have to say, even our right wing hasn\u2019t been overly fear-generating around this or opposed to it,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey highlighted concerns around security that aren\u2019t unreasonable, certainly concerns that we shared &#8230; We had a very positive response to [the refugees] right across the country because Canadians felt they could be part of this narrative that was going to, not just remind us of the kind of country we are, but contribute to a positive step for our communities in the coming years. Because the story of our country\u2014the story of this country\u2014is one of people seeking better opportunities for themselves and their children by crossing oceans and starting anew. That work\u2019s not finished yet.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_845339\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-845339\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TRUDEAU-school.jpg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau listens to a question from a student at American University, Friday, March 11, 2016 in Washington.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson</p></div>\n<p>The other striking moment came when Trudeau raised, by himself, his decision to repeal the provisions in the Conservatives\u2019 \u201cStrengthening Canadian Citizenship Act,\u201d C-24, that stripped some convicted terrorists of their Canadian citizenships.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the things the right wing had done was put forward a bill that took away the citizenship of convicted terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cA number of countries have done that around the world. It seems like a fairly obvious thing to try and do. If someone\u2019s gonna commit an act of war, an act of terrorism against the country, they probably shouldn\u2019t deserve to keep Canadian citizenship if they\u2019re doing that.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is indeed a decent paraphrase of the arguments Conservatives made in support of C-24. Trudeau said his opponents \u201cfelt they were on very, very safe ground\u201d with their policy.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe problem is, as you scratch into that a little deeper, you realize it only really applies to citizens who have, or could have, a dual nationality. So a kid who was born in Canada, and only has a Canadian citizenship\u2014but whose parents were born, for example, in Pakistan\u2014could lose his citizenship if he committed an act of terror, [whereas] a kid who was tenth-generation Canadian homegrown terrorist could never lose his citizenship. Suddenly we\u2019d made citizenship conditional on good behaviour. Or on non-heinous behaviour, which comes down to the same thing. And that devalues the citizenship: two classes of citizen.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>More from macleans.ca: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/state-dinner-essentials-7-things-you-should-know/\">Seven things you need to know about the state dinner</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Trudeau\u2019s tone suggested he knew this was not, on the face of it, a winning issue for him. \u201cIt came to the point where, in one of our largest debates, I was standing on stage against the former prime minister. He was telling people that I was willing to stand up and restore the citizenship of the one Canadian who, under this law, had had his citizenship taken away.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe knew he had me on that one. I\u2019m actually standing there defending the right of a Canadian\u2014stripped of his citizenship for terrorism\u2014to become, once again, a Canadian citizen. I stood there, and <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/did-you-miss-munkdebate-watch-our-six-key-moments/\">I defended that principle</a>, that you should not be able to take away citizenship from anyone. Our government would be, because we\u2019d reverse that law, restoring the citizenship of someone who was convicted of terrorism in Canada.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a perfect narrative for the politics of fear and aggression. Yet it\u2019s me sitting here as Prime Minister of Canada, not Stephen Harper.\u201d</p>\n<p>The story was, of course, catnip for Trudeau\u2019s centre-left audience. But it also suggests the depth of the gulf separating Trudeau from\u2014well, from vintage-2015 Stephen Harper; it will be up to the Conservative party to decide how it wants to litigate such debates in the future. All politics is local, as Tip O\u2019Neill liked to say. A Canadian prime minister visits Washington, where the locals regard him as a rebuttal to a presidential candidate, and every story he tells them recalls last year\u2019s debates, or sets up next year\u2019s.</p>\n<h4>Listen to Paul Wells report from Washington</h4>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/251387018&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-takes-ottawas-debates-to-washington/\">Justin Trudeau takes Ottawa&#8217;s debates to Washington</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-takes-ottawas-debates-to-washington/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Video: Paul Wells on Justin Trudeau&#8217;s Washington lobby day</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-washington-lobby-day/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-washington-lobby-day/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2016 00:32:31 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Barack Obama]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[state dinner]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Trudeau in Washington 2016]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[White House]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=845077</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Justin Trudeau's Washington-wide blitz produced a broad array of agreements and promises.

Both of these men were elected over the objections of less photogenic opponents who believed, and for the most part still believe, that their victories were fakery. Both men still like a good photo.

On terrorism, the two agreed &#8220;to share more information\u2014including with respect to our no-fly lists and full implementation of our entry/exit system.\u201d They will hurry to &#8220;bring down methane emissions in the oil and gas sectors in both of our countries.&#8221; They announced\u00a0&#8220;a new climate and science partnership to protect the Arctic and its people.&#8221;\u00a0To that end, Canada will send its ministers later this year to a &#8220;White House Science Ministerial on the Arctic.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>Listen to Paul Wells assess Trudeau&#8217;s visit to D.C.</h4>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/251387018&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Trudeau, Obama said, had expressed his support for a &#8220;new chapter of engagement with the Cuban people.&#8221; The two countries will &#8220;help Colombia achieve peace and remove the deadly legacy of landmines there.&#8221; Their scientists will\u00a0&#8220;prevent the spread of <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/health/zika-the-new-global-health-terror/\" target=\"_blank\">the Zika virus.</a>&#8221; \u00a0They are &#8220;urgently working to help Ethiopia deal with the worst drought in half a century.&#8221; Canada will join Obama&#8217;s\u00a0Power Africa initiative &#8220;to bring electricity\u2014including renewable energy\u2014to homes and businesses across the continent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Trudeau will be back in Washington, as was already widely known, for Obama&#8217;s Nuclear Security Summit in a few weeks. And Obama will be in Canada by the summer, as was widely surmised, for the latest so-called Three Amigos summit that Stephen Harper inexplicably postponed when it was his turn to play host a year ago.</p>\n<p>Other Canadian prime ministers have had announcements of greater depth to make when visiting their U.S. counterparts, but I don&#8217;t recall an agenda of such breadth. There&#8217;s homework here for most of Trudeau&#8217;s cabinet. &#8220;There&#8217;s something about a summit that speeds up decisions on a bunch of files,&#8221; a Canadian government official travelling with the Prime Minister told me as we were getting ready to leave Ottawa. David McNaughton, Trudeau&#8217;s\u00a0new ambassador in Washington, said\u00a0the approach of this visit pushed the tempo of his get-acquainted tour of the capital into warp drive. The results were in Obama&#8217;s Rose Garden list.

class=\"rest-of-gallery\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-washington-lobby-day/\">\n    Check out the rest of the gallery\n</a>\n\n<p>From the White House, Trudeau and his senior ministers\u2014St\u00e9phane Dion, Catherine McKenna, <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/harjit-sajjan-the-secret-weapons-of-trudeaus-commando-in-chief/\" target=\"_blank\">Harjit Sajjan,</a> Chrystia Freeland\u2014went to the State Department, where they were joined by others\u2014Marie-Claude Bibeau, Navdeep Bains\u2014for a lunch hosted by John Kerry. Then Trudeau continued on to meetings with nearly a dozen Senators, half of them Republicans, and onward to call on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Thursday night&#8217;s State Dinner still lay ahead, as did Friday&#8217;s question-and-answer session with students at the American University.</p>\n<p>It was a blitz. In Ottawa now and then, associations representing real-estate dealers or cheesemakers or research scientists sometimes organize &#8220;lobby days,&#8221; where they descend on Parliament Hill by the dozen and meet Members of Parliament in groups of four or five to plead their case on their pet issues. The goal is to accomplish through sheer force of number what\u00a0is normally hard to do: to imprint a group&#8217;s hopes or worries on the capital&#8217;s\u00a0entire legislative class. This was Justin Trudeau&#8217;s lobby day in Washington.</p>\n<p>It was striking because it was so rare.\u00a0Perhaps somebody from Brian Mulroney&#8217;s entourage can be found to remind everyone that he practiced this sort of full-court, Washington-wide press when he wanted to get Canada&#8217;s message out in Washington. With that possible exception, which was before my time, I&#8217;ve never seen a Canadian government work Washington so thoroughly at such a high level.</p>\n<p>Jean Chr\u00e9tien leaned rather too heavily on his friendship with Bill Clinton, which by the end of the Clinton years was no longer getting him very far in Congress or across the partisan divide. Chr\u00e9tien urged his ministers to reach out to their opposite numbers in the Bush administration as early\u00a0as possible, but he did not follow through with this sort of cross-Washington blitz. And though Stephen Harper was quick to lecture Chr\u00e9tien on failing to build alliances across Washington, he was too worried about seeming cozy with a Republican when Bush was in the White House, and too ambivalent about Obama at best, to risk\u00a0such an extended visit.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/trudeau-in-washington-2016\" target=\"_blank\">Read more\u00a0coverage of Trudeau&#8217;s official\u00a0visit here</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The first promise Trudeau should make to himself, if not to the public, is that he&#8217;ll be back in Washington in a year to repeat this blitz, no matter what choices a new President makes about visiting Ottawa. By then, one supposes some of Trudeau&#8217;s novelty will have worn off, but it cannot hurt for Congress and for both parties to get used to visits from a Canadian prime minister.</p>\n<p>There was speculation among the reporters travelling with Trudeau that all this work is for naught because Obama is a lame-duck president who will be gone by January. My colleague Emmanuelle Latraverse from Radio-Canada asked Obama about it. His answer is worth quoting at length, because I think it&#8217;s basically the right answer.\u00a0&#8220;As somebody who came in after an administration that, politically, obviously saw things very differently than I did,&#8221; Obama said, &#8220;what you discover is that for all the differences you may have in your political parties, when you\u2019re actually in charge, then you have to be practical. And you do what is needed to be done and what\u2019s in front of you. And one of the things that is important for the United States, or for Canada, or for any leading power in the world, is to live up to its commitments and to provide continuing momentum on efforts, even if they didn\u2019t start under your administration.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once in the Oval Office, Obama discovered he could get behind some of George W. Bush&#8217;s work, &#8220;like PEPFAR, that has saved millions of lives and prevented HIV/AIDS, or provided vital drugs to those already infected with HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world.&#8221; In areas where he was less enthusiastic about Bush&#8217;s legacy, he said, &#8220;I might have tweaked it.&#8221; But even then, &#8220;you\u2019re always concerned about making sure that the credibility of the United States is sustained, or the credibility of Canada is sustained &#8212; which is why when there\u2019s turnover in governments, the work that\u2019s been done continues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For precisely that reason, and especially after a long period of instability in relations between the heads of Canadian and U.S. governments\u2014after Bush and Chr\u00e9tien, and Bush and Martin, and even Bush and Harper and certainly after Harper and Obama\u2014a broad and sustained effort to get Washington used to visitors from Ottawa would be handy. Not just so the two could saw away at border issues, the only issues that ever seem to capture the imagination of the tiny cadre of professional cross-border specialists. But also so that Canada and the United States can once again get used to relying on each other as both seek to do good work in the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s so much spectacle when the Trudeaus travel, at least for now and, one presumes, probably until Hadrien Trudeau graduates from high school, that effects beyond the fizzy and temporary are hard to imagine. But the best news about Justin Trudeau&#8217;s day in Washington is that it may have served as a template for much serious work to come.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-washington-lobby-day/\">Video: Paul Wells on Justin Trudeau&#8217;s Washington lobby day</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-washington-lobby-day/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Follow along as the Trudeaus visit Washington</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-latest-the-trudeaus-visit-washington/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-latest-the-trudeaus-visit-washington/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2016 14:45:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Washington]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Trudeau in Washington 2016]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=844293</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Watch this rolling blog for updates on the Prime Minister's day</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-latest-the-trudeaus-visit-washington/\">Follow along as the Trudeaus visit Washington</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_844295\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-844295\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TRUDEAU-822.jpeg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, stand for the playing of national anthems during an arrival ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Thursday, March 10, 2016.

business\u2014meeting at the White House, meeting at the State Department, the pomp of a state dinner\u2014but Wednesday night in Washington was like old home week for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>\n<p>Fresh from his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base, Trudeau and Sophie Gr\u00e9goire-Trudeau attended a reception at the Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s Renwick Gallery, a block from the White House. The 300-odd guests were, overwhelmingly, Canadian, invited by the Ottawa-based Canada 2020 think tank, whose president, Tom Pitfield, grew up on Parliament Hill with Justin Trudeau when Pitfield&#8217;s father, Michael, was working as clerk of the Privy Council for Trudeau&#8217;s father, Pierre. Many of the guests had travelled to Washington from as far away as Vancouver for this week&#8217;s events. Most are\u00a0Liberal, if they have any party affiliation, although I did spot Mulroney-era cabinet minister Perrin Beatty. The Americans were, for the most part, current (Bruce Heyman) or former (David Wilkins, Gordon Giffin) U.S. ambassadors to Ottawa. The finger-food menu included sliders and smoked meat.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/the-state-of-affairs-of-state-dinners-a-look-at-past-white-house-galas/\" target=\"_blank\">A peek at state dinners of the past</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>In brief impromptu remarks to the crowd, Trudeau discussed &#8220;t<span class=\"s1\">he very real challenges&#8221; facing the world. His list included &#8220;climate change, a stalling middle class&#8221; and &#8220;wrapping our minds around the globalization that is both extremely challenging and rife with opportunities.&#8221; When the going gets rough, he said, &#8220;it becomes easy to become fearful. It becomes easy to turn in on ourselves. But we know from history that it\u2019s much more important to turn outward and to draw out the best of each other.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>There might be people in Washington who&#8217;ve seen recent news reports about Canada&#8217;s new federal government &#8220;and thought, &#8216;That was it,&#8217; &#8221; Trudeau added, tongue in cheek. &#8221; &#8216;Canada\u2019s a happy place and everyone\u2019s progressive and everyone\u2019s a feminist and everyone hugs pandas all day.&#8217; But we have real challenges just like every other country around the world. We have good days and bad days.

Bush&#8217;s White House on Feb. 5, 2001,\u00a0an observer would have been forgiven for spotting signs of a formidable new era in Canada-U.S. relations. Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, White House chief of staff Andy Card and U.S. trade representative Bob Zoellick were on hand. When Chr\u00e9tien&#8217;s foreign minister, John Manley, and Chr\u00e9tien&#8217;s main foreign-policy adviser, Claude Laverdure, lingered\u00a0after the meeting and missed the Canadian motorcade&#8217;s departure, they found themselves briefly entertained by a sweatshirt-clad, cigar-chomping Bush until another ride could come to take them away.</p>\n<p>It was at once a high-calibre and a down-home\u00a0greeting. But even though Chr\u00e9tien and Bush remained on decent personal terms long afterward\u2014Laverdure would recall later that they could always build a conversation around baseball gossip, even after other subjects became tense\u2014their divergences on Bush&#8217;s Iraq war eventually poisoned the whole relationship.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related from Wells: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeaus-isis-policy-gets-an-assist-from-obama-and-harper/\">Trudeau\u2019s ISIS policy gets an assist from Obama\u2014and Harper</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps Stephen Harper and Barack Obama had no realistic hope of a better relationship, stranded as they were, like Bush and Chr\u00e9tien, on opposite sides of an ideological fence. But Harper blew his opening hand, preparing no substantive agenda for Obama&#8217;s first Ottawa visit on Feb. 19, 2009. There was a tour of the Centre Block and some handshaking at a Byward Market bakery. A President struggling with a global financial crisis and a historic expansion of health-insurance coverage left Ottawa with the impression that nothing pressing needed his attention there. When the environmental lobby captured his attention on Keystone XL, there was no strong north-south relationship to restrain him from listening to them.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Justin Trudeau gets his turn to recast the Canada-U.S. relationship. He has advantages: an ideologically compatible president, the first time a Liberal has met with a Democrat since Chr\u00e9tien and Bill Clinton were leading their governments; the pomp of a full-blown state dinner, only the ninth of the Obama presidency and the first any president has thrown for\u00a0a Canadian in 19 years. But the timing is not ideal: Obama is nearing the end of his presidency, and the bizarre presidential primary season has thrown doubt on the future, not only of Canada-U.S. relations but of all U.S. politics, after Obama leaves office.</p>\n<p>Like Chr\u00e9tien, Trudeau is relying on his team to make an impact beyond his one-on-one relationship with Obama. Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland are among the five cabinet members who&#8217;ll travel with Trudeau for the duration of the visit. Freeland probably knows more people in Washington than any of them; as a foreign correspondent for Reuters and the <em>Financial Times</em> before her political career, she was a regular on the U.S. political talk-show circuit.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related from macleans.ca: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/justin-trudeau-takes-on-donald-trump/\">Justin Trudeau takes on Donald Trump</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Canadian delegation&#8217;s goal will be to build relationships across the administration that will last well past this week, and could even last into the next presidency, at least if a Democrat wins in November.

Bernstein/Getty Images)</p></div>\n<p>Donald Trump\u2019s political success is \u201cthe greatest present threat to the prosperity and security of the United States,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/01/larry-summers-donald-trump-is-a-serious-threat-to-american-democracy/\" target=\"_blank\">Lawrence Summers wrote on Monday in the <em>Washington Post.</em></a></p>\n<p>Summers is the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard as well as a former treasury secretary (under president Bill Clinton) and director of the National Economic Council (under President Barack Obama). He is vexed by Trump\u2019s progress toward the Republican presidential nomination. Trump\u2019s election as president, Summers wrote, would \u201crisk grave damage to the American project.\u201d It would \u201cthreaten our democracy.\u201d The mere prospect of a Trump election win, even if the event itself never comes to pass, could \u201ctip a fragile U.S. economy into recession.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/inside-the-unprecedented-illogical-incredible-rise-of-donald-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">Inside the unprecedented rise of Donald Trump</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps it is possible to agree with much of Summers\u2019 argument while noting the response it provoked. Journalists warn one another never to read online comment boards, infested as they are with five-alarm nutjobs. But what the heck. Sometimes the people have a point. The comments under Summers\u2019 article were full of contempt\u2014not for Trump but for Summers. \u201cHey look, another 1%\u2019er coming out trying to protect the 1% ruling class,\u201d one reader wrote. \u201cQuintessential evidence why the elites are completely detached from reality,\u201d another added. \u201cMore likely is the reality that the worst thing that did happen to the U.S. was the foundation of the Harvard Business School,\u201d wrote a third.</p>\n<p>Now, I\u2019m going to go along with the <em>Washington Post</em>\u2019s comment board only so far. Nothing Summers ever did justifies Trump\u2019s casual thuggery, the constant menace of violence at his rallies, the blanket slurs against Hispanic immigrants, Muslims, women, journalists and on and on. But if the American polity has grown so palsied it is vulnerable to Trump\u2019s limited charms, the best ideas of Summers and his associates have had something to do with it.</p>\n<p>Between 2006 and 2008, Summers made $5 million at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. while picking up another $2.8 million in speaking fees from firms that included Goldman Sachs and CitiGroup. Shaw survived all right when the U.S. economy more or less imploded at the end of 2008. Goldman Sachs and CitiGroup did much worse. But both firms were rescued, to the tune of billions of taxpayer dollars. The taxpayers themselves received no such rescue. Behold the fairness of what it pleases Summers to call \u201cthe American project.\u201d</p>\n<p>Summers then returned to the White House to help design many of Barack Obama\u2019s economic policies. And while from the comfortable distance of Ottawa it\u2019s easy enough for me to say they did a decent job, on the ground in the United States, the view is bleaker. Long-term unemployment spiked and remains high. Obstructionist Republicans in Congress\u2014including some of the very people now running against Trump\u2014ensured that Washington remained more or less broken as a vehicle for improving the lives of ordinary Americans, while continuing to function quite well as a deliverer of low taxes for the rich.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/how-bad-could-a-president-trump-really-be/\" target=\"_blank\">What would a Trump presidency look like?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>This helps explain why, according to a RAND Corporation large-sample Internet survey, Trump performs much better than his establishment rival Ted Cruz among likely GOP primary voters who agree that the rich should pay higher taxes and among those who think highly of labour unions. And RAND found that respondents were 86 per cent likelier to support Trump if they agreed with the statement that \u201cpeople like me don\u2019t have any say about what the government does.\u201d Today\u2019s GOP exists to cut taxes for the wealthy; bust labour unions, to the extent there are any left; and ensure that nobody has any say in what the government does because Congress is dedicated to ensuring the government doesn\u2019t do anything.</p>\n<p>Across the West in recent years, rejection of the creaky status quo has been a dominant political theme. It helps explain weird new governments in Hungary and Poland; the very different populist brinksmanship of Greece\u2019s Tsipras government; and the looming referendum on British membership of the EU. In Canada, it helps explain how Rob Ford became Toronto\u2019s mayor. For decades Republicans have valued simplistic solutions, and here comes one now to reward them. \u201cI should sooner live in a society governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston telephone directory,\u201d William F. Buckley once wrote, \u201cthan in a society governed by the 2,000 faculty members of Harvard University.\u201d Lately, the Boston phone book has been doing pretty well by Trump.

(Adrian Wyld/CP)</p></div>\n<p>It\u2019s going well, as Justin Trudeau heads toward a meeting with provincial and territorial premiers in Vancouver on March 3.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had to peel Quebec off the ceiling after the first federal memo went around,\u201d a source in another province told me.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour sources are good,\u201d an adviser to Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard said. \u201cBut not only Quebec. They also surprised Ontario and other provinces\u2014B.C. and even Alberta.\u201d</p>\n<p>Why was the spatula needed for some remedial ceiling work? \u201cIt\u2019s the old Liberal federal reflex,\u201d my Quebec source said. \u201cCentralization. We can criticize [Stephen] Harper a lot for not wanting to look after the environment, but on the other hand, when the provinces wanted to look after the environment, he wasn\u2019t getting into their jurisdictions.\u201d</p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the thing. As this Quebec government source (anonymous like all my other sources this week; sue me) recounted the Trudeau government\u2019s first clumsy attempts to herd the provinces toward a climate-change strategy everyone could sign in Vancouver next week, his tone was more amused than outraged. The early problems were being fixed, he said.</p>\n<p>Philippe Couillard feels that a key ally in making the whole process more province-friendly has been Justin Trudeau. <em>Le fils de l\u2019autre.</em> Will wonders never cease.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/at-the-first-ministers-summit-the-meeting-is-the-message-for-trudeau/\" target=\"_blank\">At the First Ministers&#8217; summit, the meeting was the message</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The main sin of \u201cthe federal machine,\u201d this Quebec source said\u2014in comments that were echoed in another conversation by a senior adviser to Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne\u2014was to forget that the provinces have been working, alone and in concert, to reduce their carbon emissions for a decade. Suddenly the feds show up and at first it was as if they thought they\u2019d invented the notion.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re proposing working groups on different subjects,\u201d the Quebec adviser said. \u201cMitigation, clean technology, climate resiliency, \u2018Let\u2019s sit together with the Indigenous people, with the public in general\u2019\u2014it\u2019s very Trudeauesque, <em>l\u00e0</em>. \u2018And we\u2019ll reach agreement.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Attends une minute, l\u00e0</em>. Life isn\u2019t like that. The provinces have their jurisdictions, there are committees, there are groups. The provinces have done a lot of consultations over the last 10 years. The provinces have their goals, they\u2019ve done things. Now the feds come along as if nothing has been done before in Canada. There\u2019s been nothing done by the federal government, I agree. But that\u2019s not the same as saying nothing has been done in Canada.\u201d</p>\n<p>This apple-cheeked, \u201cHey-kids-let\u2019s-put-on-a-show\u201d approach was similarly amusing to the Ontario government, which has been deep in the emission-reduction trenches for years. Ontario closed all of its coal-powered energy stations, producing almost all of the emissions reductions Canada-wide. Processes to recreate processes were not super welcome.</p>\n<p>But Wynne\u2019s office didn\u2019t even bother to reply to the early federal proposals, because they knew other provinces would complain and Ottawa would adjust. Indeed this seems to be what has happened.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you two things about Mr. Trudeau: Openness and sincerity,\u201d the Couillard adviser said. \u201cWhen the premier talks to him, he feels like he\u2019s being listened to, and that when Mr. Trudeau has bought into the argument, his commitments are sincere and he makes things happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>The surprise is that anyone is talking this way about a Liberal prime minister named Trudeau in Quebec City. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s more of a Sinclair than a Trudeau,\u201d my interlocutor said. The reference is to Jimmy Sinclair, the avuncular Vancouver Liberal who was the Prime Minister\u2019s maternal grandfather.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_799227\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-799227\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NOV24_WHERRY_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall speaks to reporters before a meeting with premiers hosted by the Council of The Federation in Ottawa on Monday, Nov. 23, 2015.

(Justin Tang/CP)</p></div>\n<p>Not everyone is writing glowing reviews of the meeting before it happens. Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall is in the newspapers announcing that he will never accept a carbon tax. He may be pushing on an open door. \u201cThe truth is, that region\u2019s got a lot of issues we\u2019ve got to deal with,\u201d a Trudeau adviser said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get into a fight with premiers. You guys spill a lot of ink, everybody gets angry, and nothing happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>The feds, freshly admonished in the merits of flexibility, say there are many ways to cut carbon emissions. My federal source listed four. There\u2019s \u201cthe built environment everywhere\u201d\u2014mostly old buildings that could be retrofitted with greener equipment. There\u2019s transport, from cars to public transit, heavily concentrated in the country\u2019s largest cities. There\u2019s \u201cextractive activities in the natural resource sector\u201d\u2014the huge amount of energy and carbon dioxide used to get valuable stuff, from oil to minerals to liquefied natural gas. And there\u2019s carbon pricing, which would constrain the use of carbon-emitting technology anywhere a tax is levied or a cap-and-trade scheme imposed.</p>\n<p>Any action by any government that tends to reduce emissions will be welcomed and, the Trudeau crew hopes, encouraged under a flexible set of policies whose nature will be the object of federal-provincial discussions long after the final gavel in Vancouver. If Wall doesn\u2019t want a carbon tax, he can find another mechanism. (Besides, an official in another provincial capital said, \u201cHe\u2019s usually quite different in the room than he is in the press beforehand.\u201d)</p>\n<p>There are many ways to skin this cat. Anything that works helps. \u201cPeople always take their theology texts to these things,\u201d the Trudeau adviser said, \u201cbut it\u2019s really math class.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_837641\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-837641\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Catherine-McKenna-1024x648.jpg\" alt=\"Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna walks to a meeting with her provincial counterparts Friday January 29, 2016 in Ottawa.

(Adrian Wyld/CP)</p></div>\n<p>Everyone will be staying after school to study. Catherine McKenna, the federal environment minister, has already been saying there\u2019ll be no final agreement in Vancouver. Instead, four federal-provincial \u201cwork streams\u201d will coordinate, from their respective capitals after the Vancouver meeting ends, on different projects. One group will try to identify job opportunities in expanding green-technology markets. A second will try to find some carbon-pricing mechanism that will be broadly acceptable. A third will look at all those emission-reduction strategies that aren\u2019t about a carbon price. A fourth will accept that by now some climate change is happening despite all these meetings to try to stop it, and identify strategies for helping populations adapt as floods, extreme storms, coastal erosion and Arctic warming progress.</p>\n<p>At least, that\u2019s what an adviser to McKenna told me. This person cheerfully acknowledged that in advance of the Vancouver meeting, prep work in Ottawa is being led by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. And, as the provinces have been careful to remind the Trudeau crew, everything is open to amendment in Vancouver, based on work the provinces were already doing before Trudeau even led the federal Liberals.</p>\n<p>The Vancouver meeting, then, stands somewhere near the midpoint of a process. This may be the emerging model for second-generation Trudeau federalism: low on confrontation and brinksmanship, high on consultation. It\u2019s not dramatic. We\u2019ll find out soon whether it works.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-insiders-perspective-on-trudeau-federalism-2-0/\">The insiders&#8217; perspective on Trudeau federalism 2.0</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-insiders-perspective-on-trudeau-federalism-2-0/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>16</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Meet Sir Michael Barber, the political delivery man</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/meet-sir-michael-barber-the-political-delivery-man/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/meet-sir-michael-barber-the-political-delivery-man/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2016 16:57:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[liberal party of canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Michael Barber]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=835405</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Governments have a spotty record on keeping their promises.

(Photograph by Samir Hussein)</p></div>\n<p>Nothing is obvious, not even the things that should probably be obvious. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that Sir Michael Barber makes a living helping governments do what they promised to do. There is a steady demand for his work, because in the normal course of things, governments often wind up doing something else entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince time immemorial \u2014 certainly since the institutions of democracy in the 20th century\u2014governments make commitments, get elected, and then struggle to deliver on their promises,\u201d Barber said in an interview recently. \u201cAnd that is a challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a challenge that has changed Barber\u2019s life. In 2001 Tony Blair managed to get re-elected as prime minister of the U.K., despite wildly uneven results in his first term. Blair noticed that his education minister, a steely blind Labour lifer named David Blunkett, had actually managed to make good progress against campaign commitments on literacy, higher-education attainment, and other areas. Blair poached Blunkett\u2019s main adviser, Barber, and put him in charge of something called the Prime Minister\u2019s Delivery Unit. Its goal was simple: Ensure the Blair government deliver on its promises.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I discovered with others in the Blair administration was that you could put in place some basic approaches that, if you followed them through, would make it much more likely that you\u2019d deliver what you\u2019d promised than otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_709903\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-709903\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MAC17_NEWSMAKERS_DRINKING2.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Tony Blair holds up half-pints of &quot;Blair Brew&quot;, a beer made especially for the election.

(Ian Waldie/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>Since he left the Blair government, Barber has honed these ideas into what he calls \u201cdeliverology,\u201d the art of ensuring governments meet their goals.

November 4, 2015. (Prime Minister&#8217;s Office)</p></div>\n<p>The obstacles facing any new government are well-known. First, the usual constant barrage of unforeseen events. Second, the pressure to come up with new ideas rather than checking to see how the old plans are working out. Tony Blair was a sucker for a new idea. In his new book <em>How to Run a Government</em>, Barber calls Blair\u2019s first-term administrative style \u201cgovernment by spasm.\u201d</p>\n<p>The alternative to spasm is an attempt to install a routine. A new government asks itself a series of basic questions. \u201cOne is: What are the priorities?\u201d Barber asks. \u201cThe second is: If you succeeded in delivering a given priority, how would you know? What would success look like in 2019, at the end of this mandate?\u201d The third question is, \u201cHow would you know at any given moment you\u2019re making progress toward your goals?\u201d This leads a delivery-oriented government to develop a set of indicators\u2014usually publicly available and thus, if they\u2019re heading in the wrong direction, acutely uncomfortable for the government. How many kilometres of roads have been paved to date, how many megatonnes of carbon went into the atmosphere, that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not tremendously exciting, but it\u2019s really important, getting the priorities, the definitions of success, the trajectories, the data, the routines to monitor progress, and then the ability to solve problems as they arise,\u201d Barber said. \u201cBecause however good you are at planning, you\u2019re not going to get it right. The real world never works out exactly as you anticipate. So having routines to correct and adjust the plan all the time is important.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-first-100-days/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Wells on Justin Trudeau&#8217;s first 100 days</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>One element that helped bring Barber and Trudeau together is a common sense that ambition should not be a bad word in government. \u201cThere are times when doing little seems to work, and underpromising and overdelivering seems a good option,\u201d Barber said. \u201cBut that\u2019s certainly not the analysis of the Trudeau government, and certainly not the prospectus that they put to the Canadian people during the election. They said, \u2018Actually, Canada needs big change, we want to build an inclusive, diverse Canada, we want some renewal of faith in democratic institutions, we want to reduce climate change, we need a big infrastructure upgrade.\u2019 These are big challenges.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/meet-sir-michael-barber-the-political-delivery-man/\">Meet Sir Michael Barber, the political delivery man</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/meet-sir-michael-barber-the-political-delivery-man/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>7</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Michael Ignatieff gets it very wrong on Syria</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/michael-ignatieff-gets-it-very-wrong-on-syria/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/michael-ignatieff-gets-it-very-wrong-on-syria/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2016 12:14:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[World]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bashar al-Assad]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Maclean's Voices]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Michael Ignateiff]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Syria]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=835133</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Ignatieff's latest writings on the Syria situation make him very difficult to take seriously</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/michael-ignatieff-gets-it-very-wrong-on-syria/\">Michael Ignatieff gets it very wrong on Syria</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_573103\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-573103\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAC27_IGNATIEFF_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Deborah Baic/The Globe and Mail/CP\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAC27_IGNATIEFF_POST01-660x370.jpg 660w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAC27_IGNATIEFF_POST01-680x382.jpg 680w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAC27_IGNATIEFF_POST01-360x202.jpg 360w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAC27_IGNATIEFF_POST01-510x286.jpg 510w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAC27_IGNATIEFF_POST01-640x360.jpg 640w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAC27_IGNATIEFF_POST01-123x69.jpg 123w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAC27_IGNATIEFF_POST01-273x153.jpg 273w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAC27_IGNATIEFF_POST01-650x365.jpg 650w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAC27_IGNATIEFF_POST01.jpg 822w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Deborah Baic/The Globe and Mail/CP</p></div>\n<p>Michael Ignatieff is writing again about foreign policy, which poses a challenge to those of us who would like to take him seriously, if only for old times\u2019 sake.</p>\n<p>The former federal Liberal leader, now back at Harvard, is certainly writing about a grave matter: the advance on the Syrian rebel stronghold of Aleppo by <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/assad-says-his-troops-are-advancing-thanks-to-russian-airstrikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Bashar Al-Assad loyalists</a> and Russian special forces. His arguments are appearing so often and in such lofty precincts\u2014the <em>Washington Post</em> on Feb. 9, then in the <em>Financial Times</em> six days later\u2014that he clearly wants to be noticed.</p>\n<p>What is his argument? Well, it\u2019s a bit of a moving target. On his first outing in the <em>Washington Post</em>, writing with Leon Wieseltier, Ignatieff decried \u201cthe truly incredible possibility that as the Syrian dictator and his ruthless backers close in on Aleppo, the government of the United States, in the name of the struggle against the Islamic State, will simply stand by while Russia, Assad and Iran destroy their opponents at whatever human cost.\u201d</p>\n<p>This policy, Ignatieff and Wieseltier add, \u201cis shameful.\u201d The remedy? \u201cA perfectly realistic path that would honour our highest ideals,\u201d they write. \u201cOperating under a NATO umbrella, the United States could use its naval and air assets in the region to establish a no-fly zone from Aleppo to the Turkish border,\u201d they write. That\u2019s a swath of Syria measuring about 150 km to the north and west of Aleppo. Clearing the skies there would \u201cprevent the continued bombardment of civilians and <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/saving-family-no-417/\" target=\"_blank\">refugees</a> by any party, including the Russians.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeaus-isis-policy-gets-an-assist-from-obama-and-harper/\" target=\"_blank\">Trudeau\u2019s ISIS policy gets an assist from Obama\u2014and Harper</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps it would also upset the Russians. On this, Ignatieff and Wieseltier were implacable. \u201cIf the Russians and Syrians sought to prevent humanitarian protection\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they would face the military consequences.\u201d The authors did hope that \u201cconstant contact with the Russian leadership\u201d could avert \u201ca great-power confrontation.\u201d Another word for great-power confrontation is war between the world\u2019s two largest nuclear-armed military powers. Oh well: \u201cRisk is no excuse for doing nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>This sort of talk is often hailed as \u201cmuscular\u201d at <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/michael-ignatieff-goes-home/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard, where Ignatieff is the Edward R. Murrow Professor of Practice</a>, and the Brookings Institution, where Wieseltier is the Isaiah Berlin Senior Fellow in Culture and Policy. So muscular that by this week Ignatieff, writing alone in the <em>Financial Times</em>, was toning it down. He rhetorically downgraded the no-fly zone to an \u201caerial protection zone,\u201d a distinction with no difference I can find. More significantly, he now said clearing the skies over northwestern Syria would be a \u201cfinal resort.\u201d Further economic sanctions on Moscow could come first, followed by \u201crapid\u201d supply of anti-aircraft and anti-missile equipment to \u201ctrusted\u201d rebel forces.</p>\n<p>One spots difficulties with this chain of argument, even as amended. Two years of harsh sanctions, along with the coincidental but happy collapse in world oil prices, has not noticeably cramped Vladimir Putin\u2019s style. A week of harsher sanctions wouldn\u2019t do much more. Nor is it clear how rapid the deployment of Patriot or shoulder-launched missiles could be. What is clear is that such munitions rarely stay in trusted hands for long, whether because the weapons prove slippery or the trust is misplaced. So soon enough, Ignatieff\u2019s modi\ufb01ed argument defaults to his first: Force the air forces of Russia and Syria from the Syrian skies.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe risks of accident, miscalculation or escalation are not small,\u201d Ignatieff admits. But they are \u201cjustified because the stakes are nothing less than the credibility of the NATO alliance, the survival of Europe as a union and the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.\u201d</p>\n<p>So damn the cost, he is saying. Except he also claims there wouldn\u2019t be much cost. The likelihood of escalation (recall that this is a euphemism for war with Russia) \u201ccan be reduced\u201d by \u201chourly contact with the Russian military to manage \u2018deconfliction.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_233430\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-233430\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Iggy_Dion_slide.jpg\" alt=\"Stephane Dion, right, waves to delegates as he takes the stage with Michael Igantieff after winning the Liberal leadership Saturday, Dec. 2, 2006 in Montreal.

(CP PHOTO/Ryan Remiorz) Canada</p></div>\n<p>Here I\u2019m afraid I move from skepticism to dismay. The cause is this word \u201cdeconfliction.\u201d Despite appearances, it has a plain meaning. The<em> Guardian</em> newspaper says it describes \u201cattempts to ensure that U.S. and Russian air forces don\u2019t shoot at each other while they conduct overlapping air campaigns.\u201d The <em>Guardian</em> \ufb01rst offered a de\ufb01nition for deconfliction in 1991: \u201ctrying not to have so many planes in the air that they collide.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deconfliction, in other words, means constant coordination between two or more air forces whose goals are not identical but whose motives are not overtly antagonistic. While they continue to fly in the same airspace. To avoid combat no side wants.</p>\n<p>Which is to say that in the context of a no-fly zone enforced by one side over the others, with the stated goal of making the others face \u201cmilitary consequences\u201d if they launch their aircraft, deconfliction is a perfectly meaningless word. It is a word you must not use if your goal is to convey meaning. Its use betrays the absence of meaning. It actually sucks meaning out of the rest of the sentence in which it appears.</p>\n<p>This is where it becomes very difficult to discuss Ignatieff as though he were a serious person: Because he has already warned people not to do that when he is writing as a Harvard academic.</p>\n<p>In 2003, at the apex of the Bush administration\u2019s hubris between the apparent easy win in Afghanistan and the prospect of an <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canada-in-iraq-the-chretien-precedent/\" target=\"_blank\">easy win in Iraq</a>, Ignatieff wrote in the <em>New York Times</em> about how awesome the American empire was. Those are his own words: \u201cWhat word but \u2018empire\u2019 describes the awesome thing that America is becoming?\u201d</p>\n<p>This was <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/smart-guy-eh/\" target=\"_blank\">Ignatieff\u2019s justification for invading Iraq.</a> At the time he had plenty of company. \u201cTimidity is not prudence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a confession of weakness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Four years later, when Iraq had turned out badly and Ignatieff had become a Liberal MP, he had a different sort of confession to make. This was his famous \u201cGetting Iraq wrong\u201d article, also in the <em>New York Times</em>. He had to explain, not only that he had been wrong to urge war in Iraq, but how such wrongness had been possible. He decided to disown his past life, on the apparent assumption that he would not return to it.</p>\n<p>Politicians, he wrote, \u201ccan\u2019t afford the luxury of entertaining ideas that are merely interesting. They have to work with the small number of ideas that happen to be true and the even smaller number that happen to be applicable to real life. In academic life, false ideas are merely false and useless ones can be fun to play with.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a pretty harsh indictment of academics. Was Ignatieff really saying academics could discard the true and the applicable in favour of the merely false? Well, as he wrote with a chuckle, \u201cAs a former denizen of Harvard, I\u2019ve had to learn that a sense of reality doesn\u2019t always flourish in elite institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now he is the Edward R. Murrow Chair of Practice, which apparently does not make perfect. Mocking him would be pointless. And it would leave unanswered the question he at least tries to answer: What is to be done about Syria, a crossroads for many different kinds of the world\u2019s worst people, a slaughterhouse from which millions flee?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know. I try to stick as closely as possible to what is true and applicable even when it is no fun to play with. I\u2019m not sure how much a no-fly zone would help, when so much of <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-trudeau-is-lost-on-the-middle-east/\" target=\"_blank\">Syria\u2019s slaughter is happening on the ground</a>. Even if a no-fly zone could be enforced. Even if it wouldn\u2019t escalate to some shambolic approximation of a world war. I think Barack Obama will be haunted to his grave by doubts about how Syria got where it is.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick</p></div>\n<p>To say Justin Trudeau <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/liberals-dodge-bullet-as-u-s-applauds-canadas-new-mission-against-isil\" target=\"_blank\">dodged a bullet</a> when the Obama administration said nice things about his new ISIS/Syria/Iraq policy is to understate things.</p>\n<p>The Prime Minister didn&#8217;t just\u00a0escape harm inflicted by a jilted ally\u00a0(though he still must remain nervous about domestic Canadian political reaction, which naturally will parse these things differently from the way any foreign power does). He received a positive boost from a choreographed succession of American political figures. It was objectively harder for the Conservative Opposition to criticize Trudeau at the end of the day than it had been at the beginning.</p>\n<p>First up was Peter Cook, the Pentagon spokesman and stand-in\u00a0for Defence Secretary Ashton Carter, who has been portrayed as the bad cop to Secretary of State John Kerry&#8217;s Trudeau-hugging good-cop softie on the Canada file. What&#8217;s significant is that Cook didn&#8217;t just shrug and accept Trudeau&#8217;s training-and-relief-but-no-fighters stance, he flagged it as a model for other U.S. allies to emulate. &#8220;The\u00a0Canadian announcement is the kind of response the secretary\u2019s been looking for from coalition members,&#8221; Cook said at the daily Pentagon briefing, &#8220;as the United States and coalition partners push to accelerate the campaign against ISIL.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After that, remarks from U.S. ambassador Bruce Heyman (&#8220;<a href=\"http://canada.usembassy.gov/news-events/2016-news-and-events/february-2016/8-february-2016-ambassador-heyman-on-announcement-of-canadas-contributions-to-the-counter-daesh-coalition.html\" target=\"_blank\">I was pleased</a>&#8220;) and, in a paraphrased readout of a phone conversation with Trudeau, from Obama himself (&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/08/readout-presidents-call-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-canada\" target=\"_blank\">The President welcomed Canada&#8217;s current and new contributions</a>&#8220;) were gravy.</p>\n<p>How are such things possible?</p>\n<p>One possible interpretation, which I suspect you will find represented in the comment section below this post soon enough, is that the Obama crowd are so thoroughly unable to\u00a0find their own hindquarters\u00a0with a map and a flashlight that they don&#8217;t even know when they have been hung out to dry\u00a0by quislings. But I&#8217;ve since been struck by another possibility: that the Harper government&#8217;s contribution to the fight against the Islamic State was so slight it is hard to find anyone who&#8217;ll mourn its passing.</p>\n<p>This interpretation is seriously off-brand for the Conservatives, and I don&#8217;t imagine it&#8217;ll find many takers, but I&#8217;m stuck with the facts. Canada&#8217;s six fighters performed fewer than three per cent of all coalition strikes against so-called Islamic State targets. <a href=\"http://www.680news.com/2015/10/02/fewer-canadian-bombs-dropping-on-iraq-syria-since-election-call-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">Last September they struck 10 times.</a> In a month.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canada-in-iraq-the-chretien-precedent/\" target=\"_blank\">Compare that with the effort</a> the notorious Ritz Bar dilettante Brian Mulroney mustered a generation earlier when Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait: 24 CF-18 fighters and a force of nearly 2,000 soldiers, stationed in the Gulf theatre on two destroyers and a supply ship, in a naval HQ in Bahrain and an impromptu airbase in Qatar.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty robust. It was such serious business that the Liberal caucus of then-rookie leader Jean Chr\u00e9tien was seriously divided over whether it should stay when fighting broke out. Chr\u00e9tien reversed himself entirely, first calling for the deployment to be cancelled, then voting \u2014 with most but not all of his caucus \u2014 to let it stay and fight. There was certainly no room for Chr\u00e9tien to do the kind of this-but-not-that hairsplitting Trudeau indulged on Monday by tripling training while recalling jet fighters, because Mulroney&#8217;s was an all-hands-on-deck effort that could not be realistically exceeded in any of its particulars.</p>\n<p>And Iraq &#8217;91 in no way represented the existential peril to Canada that Stephen Harper believed Islamic terrorism might pose today. In <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/general/how-he-sees-canadas-role-in-the-world-and-where-he-wants-to-take-the-country-2/\" target=\"_blank\">an interview with <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> soon after the 2011 election</a> \u2014 one I have quoted many times because I believe it offers important insight into Harper&#8217;s thinking \u2014 he compared\u00a0the fight against terrorism to the 20th-century fights against Hitler and Stalin, &#8220;those big conflicts where everything\u2019s at stake and where you take a side and show you can contribute to the right side.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So one question that could have been asked to Harper at the time was: If everything&#8217;s at stake, what the hell are you doing sending only six fighters?</p>\n<p>The result is before us today. &#8220;Your CF-18s, we don&#8217;t need them,&#8221; a diplomat from a European country with serious skin in the anti-ISIS game told several reporters at a private lunch recently. &#8220;We don&#8217;t need them.&#8221; The Harper training effort was so rudimentary it is possible for Trudeau to triple it. The troop commitment was so modest it is possible to exceed it. The bar was set so low it is possible for Ash Carter, the toughest guy on the Obama block, to announce Trudeau has raised it.</p>\n<p>This is becoming a problem for the Harper legacy. For, say, half a decade after 2010, Conservatives kept asking one another, nervously, precisely when Harper Conservatism would start to serve up the occasional head rush, as Thatcher and Reagan and Mike Harris Conservatism had sometimes done. The answer, from Harper and his staff and the occasional author, was that Harper was going about it another way: cautiously, incrementally, a wee bit at a time, the longer he was prime minister.</p>\n<p>What has been striking, with gusts to breathtaking, is how easily this young Liberal Prime Minister has begun\u00a0dismantling even those elements of a Harper legacy that are easy to discern: the criminal-justice stuff, the long-form census, the commitment to minimal government, which could only work if Harper succeeded in bullying\u00a0his successor into maintaining balanced budgets. Now the fight against terrorism. A Trudeau retreat would have been plainer for all to see, if only there had been much from which to retreat.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeaus-isis-policy-gets-an-assist-from-obama-and-harper/\">Trudeau&#8217;s ISIS policy gets an assist from Obama\u2014and Harper</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeaus-isis-policy-gets-an-assist-from-obama-and-harper/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>83</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>How Ottawa got its groove on.

(Devcore)</p></div>\n<p>Much of what makes Ottawa annoying is on its way to being fixed. The city, I mean: if you\u2019re annoyed by Ottawa as a set of ideas about how Canada should be governed, I can\u2019t offer much hope. But as a place to live and visit, lately each year is better than the last.</p>\n<p>Sparks Street had long been a forest of construction cranes. It\u2019s looking good, its government buildings buffed and its private commerce more energetic. Parliament\u2019s West Block, a dingy heap of stonemasonry when I moved to Ottawa, has been polished until it would make you proud. Soon a glass dome will cover its courtyard so MPs can debate there, while work crews renovate the stately Centre Block itself. Over the same period, senators will move across Wellington, to the long-abandoned train station, to do whatever it is they do.</p>\n<p>Grotty Rideau Street is being repaved in stages. The big mall there is completing a <a href=\"http://www.pcl.com/projects-that-inspire/pages/rideau-centre-retail-expansion.aspx\">quarter-billion-dollar improvement</a>. Ground will be broken next week on a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/national-arts-centre-in-ottawa-gets-110m-for-makeover-1.2866949\">$110-million facelift</a> for the National Arts Centre. Light rail stations are going up across the city. Any day now the mayor, Jim Watson, will visit the long-abandoned old U.S. Embassy, with three ministers from the Trudeau government, to brainstorm a <a href=\"https://catherinemckenna.liberal.ca/catherine-mckenna-calls-for-repurposing-of-former-u-s-embassy-building-to-support-tourism-and-job-creation/\">new cultural vocation</a> for an elegant old building that has been dormant for 16 years.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/world-class-whine-why-ottawas-haters-are-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Wells takes on Ottawa&#8217;s haters</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Taken together, it\u2019s a modest renaissance for a modest city. There remains one big mess: a huge barren field only a few blocks west of Parliament. This is the grandly named <a href=\"http://www.ncc-ccn.gc.ca/planning/master-plans/lebreton-flats\">LeBreton Flats</a>. It was the industrial heart of dirty old Ottawa. For 40 years it has been nothing much. The ground is contaminated from the heavy industry that used to be situated there, and from the mountains of snow that city crews dumped there later.</p>\n<p>In the last decade, civilization has begun creeping back. Results are mixed. A big and well-run Canadian War Museum opened in 2005. Condominium towers have gone up at the flats\u2019 east end, but no business or pedestrian traffic enlivens the neighbourhood. Most of the field is still just field.</p>\n<p>Now the National Capital Commission, the often inscrutable federal agency that controls this real estate, is running a competition to see who will get to build on this land, so blighted and so full of potential, a stone\u2019s throw from the parts of Ottawa the tour groups visit.</p>\n<p>Six groups of developers entered the competition. Only two have stayed in through the bid process. Their proposals were unveiled to the public last month. As almost always happens when people are invited to discuss the future of their community, the debate has become one of the city\u2019s most animated public conversations.</p>\n<p>One bidder is, essentially, the Ottawa Senators. The NHL team has played for nearly 20 years in an arena in Kanata, more than a half-hour\u2019s drive from downtown Ottawa. That was a mistake the Sens want to fix, and, under the name <a href=\"http://www.ncc-ccn.gc.ca/planning/master-plans/lebreton-flats/rendezvous-lebreton-group\">RendezVous LeBreton Group</a>, they propose a new arena at LeBreton Flats, surrounded by sleek condominium towers.</p>\n<p>The other group, composed of developers from Ontario and Quebec who are using the name <a href=\"http://www.ncc-ccn.gc.ca/planning/master-plans/lebreton-flats/devcore-canderel-dls-group\">LeBreton Re-Imagined</a>, surprised many observers by announcing they want to build an arena too. But their proposal also includes a bandshell much like the one at Chicago\u2019s Millennium Park, along with a handful of new museums and a central boulevard that the group\u2019s architect, Richard Brisbin, describes as a \u201cmash-up\u201d of ceremonial boulevards in New York City (the new High Line park), Paris (the Tuileries Garden) and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>I gave Brisbin a call because I\u2019ve long admired his work. I like the LeBreton Re-Imagined bid, which keeps most of its condos across the street from its grander public spaces. But much of the conversation in Ottawa assumes this bid is the underdog, because Sens owner Eugene Melnyk is adamant he won\u2019t run his hockey club out of their arena if they beat him. If you want hockey downtown, the easiest way to do it is to let Melnyk win.</p>\n<p>This kind of talk drives Brisbin politely mad. \u201cHockey couldn\u2019t be in better hands. If Mr. Melnyk wins, hallelujah. If Mr. Melnyk doesn\u2019t win, hallelujah. There\u2019s a team here, we\u2019re ready to sit down with them.\u201d Melnyk\u2019s competitors are even willing to buy the Sens, if it comes to that. Melnyk insists they\u2019re not for sale.</p>\n<p>But hockey, meanwhile, is only \u201c41 nights a year,\u201d Brisbin says. For the rest of the year, he\u2019s taken his cues from what the NCC asked for in its request for proposals: \u201ca memorable capital landmark development\u2009&#8230;\u2009[with the] highest quality of architecture and sustainable design.\u201d</p>\n<p>Brisbin believes he\u2019s delivered. \u201cOur first phase has an elementary school, it\u2019s got a YMCA, it\u2019s got a seniors\u2019 development, a daycare. It has some of the most successful Ottawa businesspeople, retail and otherwise, as ground-floor tenants. It\u2019s got a little farmers\u2019 march\u00e9 and piazza.\u201d The big stuff\u2014the arena, the bandshell\u2014would come later, but that\u2019s a sturdy anchor to start.</p>\n<p>The NCC has retained Jack Diamond, the fiercely demanding Toronto architect, to help evaluate the bids. We should know who\u2019s won by year\u2019s end.

Jim Young / Reuters</p></div>\n<p>There have been times, as the Justin Trudeau era in Canadian politics approaches its 100th day, that the new Prime Minister has resembled Wile E. Coyote in the old Warner Brothers cartoons: two metres out from the edge of a cliff, eyes locked on a tantalizing prize just out of reach, suspended in mid-air, managing somehow not to falagl. Not yet.</p>\n<p>That wee milestone, by the way, falls on Wednesday, Jan. 27: One hundred days since Trudeau\u2019s Liberals won 184 seats in the election of Oct. 19, 2015, a victory that gave the Liberals a solid majority in the House of Commons. (If you count, instead, from the sunny November day when Trudeau and his cabinet strode up the highway to Rideau Hall to swear in the new government, then the 100-day mark won\u2019t come until Feb. 12. But already some patterns have been set, so why wait?)</p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/inside-justin-trudeaus-turbo-zen-army/\">Inside Trudeau&#8217;s &#8216;turbo-Zen&#8217; army\u00a0</a></strong></p>\n<p>Like the cartoon coyote, Trudeau has had some luck defying gravity. He has so far had to face the House of Commons only briefly and without sustaining serious damage. Reviews by overseas observers of his early forays into international summitry have been good. Poll support for the Liberals is strong: 17 points ahead of the second-place <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/conservative-caucus-unrest-mounts/\" target=\"_blank\">Conservatives</a> in a nationwide Nanos poll Jan. 14; 30 points up on the second-place NDP in a CROP poll of Quebecers.</p>\n<p>But there is trouble all around. Canadian CF-18 fighters are in near-daily bombing runs against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, even though Trudeau has said they should not be there. The Alberta economy is in its worst shape in a generation, dragging the value of the loonie and much of Canada\u2019s economic health down with it. Trade deals and pipeline projects are causing conflict among people who would otherwise be natural Trudeau allies, like Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, who supports the Energy East project, and Montreal Mayor <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/big-cities-little-respect-why-the-pipeline-problem-is-a-proxy-for-a-bigger-issue/\" target=\"_blank\">Denis Coderre, who wants it stopped</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Trudeau: &#8216;It&#8217;s about substance&#8217;</h3>\n\n        <meta itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"PT2M11S\" />\n        <meta itemprop=\"thumbnailUrl\" content=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MAC46_CABINET_FEATURE01-150x150.jpg\" />\n        <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Justin Trudeau&amp;#8217;s first 100 days\" />\n        <meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"From free-falling oil to terrorism, the Liberal government has already had its share of woes\" />\n        <meta itemprop=\"uploadDate\" content=\"2016-01-27T06:40:42-05:00\" />\n    \n    <div style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//admin.brightcove.com/js/api/SmartPlayerAPI.js\"></script>\n\n    <object id=\"myExperience4664167199001\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\">\n        <param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" />\n        <param name=\"width\" value=\"822\" />\n        <param name=\"height\" value=\"462\" />\n        <param name=\"playerID\" value=\"781201057001\" />\n        <param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAAAyz2WOE~,aVUQ6mHrguBSuSrVFuMzlGsPf_mMTNMB\" />\n        <param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"onTemplateLoad\" />\n        <param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"onTemplateReady\" />\n        <param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4664167199001\" />\n                <param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&amp;iu=%2F7326%2Frogers.publishing%2Fmacleans.CPGBusiness%2Fvideos&amp;ciu_szs=728x90%2C300x250&amp;impl=s&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;env=vp&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;ad_rule=1&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;cmsid=1464\" />\n                <param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-first-100-days/\" />\n        <param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" />\n    </object>\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    brightcove.createExperiences();\n</script>\n\n<hr />\n<p>In Trudeau\u2019s entourage, there is relief at a decent start, and the certainty that their luck won\u2019t hold out forever.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we underestimated the reserve of pent-up animosity, frustration, whatever you want to call it, with Mr. [Stephen] Harper,\u201d one senior cabinet minister said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe tonal change alone has generated a lot of goodwill. You walk through the front door, if you\u2019re the PM, instead of sneaking in the back. You come down the stairs, say hello to people. It won\u2019t be eternal, it won\u2019t work miracles, but people appreciate the difference.\u201d</p>\n<p>Events both planned and surprising last week showed the busy pace Trudeau continues to set for himself\u2014and some of the storm clouds gathering around the government. At a <del datetime=\"2016-02-10T16:44:43+00:00\">Fairmont</del>[UPDATE: The resort has not been a Fairmont property since 2012. Sorry for my mistake &#8211; pw] resort hotel in St. Andrews, N.B., Trudeau\u2019s young and largely inexperienced cabinet wrapped up a three-day retreat devoted entirely to professional development. Sir Michael Barber, an international management consultant who served as chief adviser on delivery to former U.K. prime minister Tony Blair, led three days of seminars on \u201cdeliverology,\u201d his term for a set of mechanisms designed to ensure that governments actually meet the goals they set for themselves.</p>\n<p>Governments often frustrate their own supporters by talking about change without delivering any. Trudeau is determined not to do that. The St. Andrews retreat was boot camp.</p>\n<p>On the first evening, Barber described his philosophy of government in general terms. The next day was devoted to workshops on three actual Trudeau priorities: greenhouse-gas reduction, infrastructure funding, and the celebrations surrounding the 150th anniversary of Confederation in 2017. Sitting at tables of five or six, ministers brainstormed objectives they wanted to reach in each area, mechanisms for reaching those goals, and ways to measure progress or the lack of it. On the third day, Barber discussed how ministers could incorporate these techniques into their own office and ministries.</p>\n<p>But during a break from the brainstorming on Monday, Trudeau was reminded that the world doesn\u2019t always wait for plans. Six Quebecers had been <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/deaths-of-quebecers-strengthen-resolve-in-terrorism-fight-couillard/\" target=\"_blank\">murdered in Burkina Faso</a> by al-Qaeda terrorists. Trudeau telephoned their families, a day later than Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard had done. When the Prime Minister called Yves Richard, whose wife Maude Carrier was one of the victims, the conversation took a nasty turn. Speaking later to a radio host, Richard dismissed Trudeau\u2019s condolences as \u201cpolitical babble\u201d and bragged, \u201cI hung up in his face, and it felt good.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next day Trudeau and a half-dozen cabinet ministers departed for the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/chrystia-freeland-unveils-harpers-future-in-davos/\" target=\"_blank\">World Economic Forum in Davos</a>. There would be beer and selfies with Bono and Kevin Spacey, and more staid meetings with top executives from Royal Dutch Shell, Microsoft, General Motors and Facebook. Did Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, give him the gears over threatening to pull those fighters out of Syria? Not the way Stoltenberg tells it. \u201cGreat meeting @JustinTrudeau,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cSo many issues that we agree on, from security to the vital role of men as feminists.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_824539\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/TRUDEAU-Davos-story.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-824539\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/TRUDEAU-Davos-story.jpg\" alt=\"Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gestures as he speaks during a panel&quot;The Canadian Opportunity&quot;at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2016.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler)</p></div>\n<p>While he was in Davos, Trudeau announced by news release that he was replacing his clerk of the Privy Council, the top civil servant in the bureaucracy. Janice Charette, who had held the job for barely 15 months, was out, without warning. Michael Wernick, a former deputy minister of Aboriginal affairs who had never met Trudeau before last Oct. 19, was the new guy. Wernick had some advance notice, sources say, but not a lot: he rushed off to attend the cabinet retreat in New Brunswick with the PM at the last minute.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/because-its-2016-talking-gender-parity-in-davos/\">Because it&#8217;s 2016: Talking gender parity in\u00a0Davos\u00a0</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Is Wernick a placeholder while some handpicked successor is groomed? Maybe. Any clerk serves at the boss\u2019s pleasure. Matthew Mendelsohn, a former provincial deputy minister from Ontario who is well-liked by the Trudeau crew, has moved to Ottawa to take up the \u201cdeliverology\u201d role in the civil service that Michael Barber pioneered in the U.K. Some observers suspect he\u2019ll be Trudeau\u2019s real right hand when he\u2019s ready. In the meantime, Wernick\u2019s role has not been limited in time or scope. He has a mandate from the PM to make any changes he deems necessary as the bureaucracy revs into overdrive after a decade of uneasy doldrums under the Harper Conservatives.</p>\n<p>The abrupt switch from Charette to Wernick has put noses out of joint among Parliament Hill lifers who are certain they know the proper form in such matters. In this, it resembles Trudeau\u2019s astonishing decision, almost exactly two years earlier, to expel every senator from the Liberal caucus. Then as now, the people directly affected were not told of his plan until he executed it. This is a Prime Minister who can deliver surprising change quickly, at least within a kilometre of the Peace Tower.</p>\n<p>He will soon need to expand his blast radius. \u201cSo far we\u2019ve basically been implementing fairly non-controversial parts of our platform,\u201d the senior cabinet minister said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no internal debate.\u201d But <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-ottawa-should-resist-the-urge-to-be-helpful/\" target=\"_blank\">politics will come crashing back</a>, \u201cand the budget will probably be the cold shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>The big problem is the utter\u2014and apparently sustained\u2014collapse of resource revenues. Its effects are felt in Newfoundland and Labrador and in Saskatchewan, but its <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/life-at-20-dollar-oil-nation-divided/\" target=\"_blank\">epicentre is Alberta</a>. Trudeau sent Gerald Butts, his principal secretary and most trusted factotum, to Calgary and Edmonton two weeks ago to gauge the scale of the damage. Butts met with senior oil and gas executives. He visited Alberta Premier Rachel Notley\u2019s chief of staff, Brian Topp, and the province\u2019s top bureaucrat, Richard Dicerni. And he met with social service agencies, including the YWCA, to estimate the human cost of layoffs that already outnumber the worst of the job losses after the 2008 market crash.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related reading: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/life-at-20-dollar-oil-nation-divided/\">Life at $20 a barrel</a></strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_806163\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-806163\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DEC_7_MORNEAU_POST.jpg\" alt=\"Finance Minister Bill Morneau speaks during an announcement in Ottawa, Monday, December 7, 2015.

But Morneau is new to politics, and one would be wise to put more stock in his presence than his remarks. The March budget is quickly turning into a massive first-aid kit for Canada\u2019s resource-producing regions.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to come up with an infrastructure policy that\u2019s a vote of confidence in the future of the Alberta economy,\u201d one Trudeau adviser said. \u201cAll budgets are tricky communications exercises. But in this case we\u2019ve got to communicate the opportunity that\u2019s available to us and the confidence we have in the future of the economy\u2014while responding to a very grave situation in commodity-producing provinces.\u201d</p>\n<p>To tee up the budget, Trudeau and several ministers will transform a little-noticed West Coast clean-technology conference into a domestic sequel to Davos. The Globe Series conferences, devoted to environmentally friendly businesses, have been happening in Vancouver every two years for a quarter-century. The Harper government came close to ignoring them. Trudeau, Environment Minister <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/canada-earns-fossil-tag-at-paris-climate-talks/\" target=\"_blank\">Catherine McKenna</a>, and Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains will head a large federal delegation at this year\u2019s Globe Series conference March 2-4. Several sources say Trudeau will also host a first ministers meeting in Vancouver during the conference. The goal is to showcase government initiatives in innovation and the environment, and frankly to rely on a lot of visiting global talent to help determine what those initiatives should be.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, Trudeau is considering a Team Canada trade mission to China and India, an echo of his predecessor Jean Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s frequent trips to both destinations, and a sign of renewed focus on emerging markets.</p>\n<p>And he will keep working through the ramifications of decisions he has already made. Kicking all those senators out of the Liberal caucus means there is no government representative in Parliament\u2019s upper house. The Liberals have offered to send a cabinet minister from the House of Commons into the Senate, once a week, to take questions from senators on government policy. It\u2019s procedurally tricky\u2014the Senate would have to sit as a \u201ccommittee of the whole\u201d to welcome this outsider in their midst\u2014but such hurdles will very soon be the least of Trudeau\u2019s problems.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_695389\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-695389\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/110_13_PearsonAndKids1-1024x719.jpg\" alt=\"Lester Pearson.

(Winnipeg Free Press)</p></div>\n<p>The practice of counting out from election day to an arbitrary deadline was invented, and immediately doomed, by advisers to Lester Pearson when he led the Liberal opposition in 1963. Pearson\u2019s opponent, the Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, had earned a reputation as a ditherer, especially on whether Canada should arm with nuclear warheads in the depths of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>Somebody suggested Pearson promise \u201csixty days of decision.\u201d He did, and he won.</p>\n<p>Pearson\u2019s problem was that he was not much better at deciding things than Diefenbaker was, and his sixty days were a mess. On the 59th day his finance minister, Walter Gordon, submitted his resignation. (Pearson declined to accept it.)</p>\n<p>In his memoirs, Pearson recounts that a year after his sixty days were up, he welcomed the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, for lunch at 24 Sussex Drive. The big fancy promises had only gotten him in trouble, Pearson lamented. Wilson \u201cdisagreed,\u201d Pearson wrote.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe pointed out that you can make no decisions unless you are the government and that it was, as he saw it, our unqualified, confident stand that won the election for us. Present difficulties, he asserted, were a small price to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Trudeau resisted the urge to put any timeline on his promises. As the trouble gets deeper and the headaches pile up, he will perhaps console himself with Wilson\u2019s advice to Pearson: Win first. Worry later. This young Prime Minister has hundreds of days to worry ahead of him.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-first-100-days/\">Justin Trudeau&#8217;s first 100 days</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-first-100-days/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>55</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Paul Wells: Everything I know about leadership</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/paul-wells-everything-i-know-about-leadership/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/paul-wells-everything-i-know-about-leadership/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2016 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[conservative party of canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kevin O'Leary]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[liberal party of canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[New Democratic Party]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=825371</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Advice for a party seeking a leader, from Maclean's Political Editor</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/paul-wells-everything-i-know-about-leadership/\">Paul Wells: Everything I know about leadership</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_760511\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MACBULLDOG_SEP24_GEDDES_POST01.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-760511\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MACBULLDOG_SEP24_GEDDES_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"A technician cleans the set in preparation for Thursday night's French language leaders debate  Wednesday, September 23, 2015 in Montreal.

If anyone in Canadian politics had a formula for making or bottling successful leaders, they\u2019d be rich. What makes a person able to win and succeed in politics? What is it that attracts loyal followers? Can it be taught?</p>\n<p><strong>Related reading: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/paul-wells-lessons-from-a-one-time-debate-moderator/\">Lessons from a one-time debate moderator</a></strong></p>\n<p>Here is everything I know about political leadership.</p>\n<p>Mostly I\u2019ve learned there isn\u2019t one formula. If you have a picture in your head of an ideal leader, you will eventually watch your preferred leader get beaten by somebody who doesn\u2019t match your image at all.</p>\n<p>One Saturday morning in 2002 I ran a column in the <em>National Post</em> endorsing Jim Flaherty as the successor to Mike Harris at the top of the Ontario Progressive Conservative party. That night I went to the victory party for the man who\u2019d beaten Flaherty to become Ontario\u2019s new Conservative premier, Ernie Eves.</p>\n<p>Eves\u2019s supporters couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d been more impressed by someone else. Wasn\u2019t Ernie eloquent? (Not particularly.) Wasn\u2019t he charismatic? (Nope.) Didn\u2019t he have real-world business experience? (Not a huge amount.) A prevailing line of speculation at the Eves victory party held that I must have endorsed Flaherty because my paper\u2019s Liberal owners wanted to sabotage the Progressive Conservatives. When I swore I was sincere, more than one Eves volunteer sought to shut down the conversation by saying, \u201cYeah, sure, whatever. But come on: Premier Dalton McGuinty?\u201d</p>\n<p>McGuinty\u2014younger than Eves, all knees and elbows, not profound\u2014was a joke in their mind, and would be seen by the voters to be one. And that would be that. But of course McGuinty did beat Eves, and 12 years later Ontario is still in the grip of a Liberal dynasty.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Cet homme ne sera jamais premier ministre du Qu\u00e9bec</em>,\u201d Lucien Bouchard once said of Jean Charest. \u201c<em>Il n\u2019en est pas digne</em>!\u201d (This man will never be Quebec\u2019s premier. He\u2019s not worthy.) But of course, that choice was not Bouchard\u2019s to make. Quebecers disagreed with him, and Charest ended up serving as premier for twice as long as Bouchard had. You see this pattern all the time. A leader written off by his opponents ends up beating them. It happened to Jean Chr\u00e9tien (\u201cIs this a prime minister?\u201d his opponent\u2019s ad said, incredulously), and to Stephen Harper, and to Justin Trudeau. Each seemed custom-built for his opponents\u2019 mockery, until he beat them.</p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/wellss-rules-annotated/\">Wells&#8217;s rules, annotated\u00a0</a></strong></p>\n<p>So never hurry to write someone off.</p>\n<p>But just as it\u2019s possible to underestimate certain leaders, it\u2019s possible to overestimate others. I think that\u2019s likeliest to happen when dealing with a leader who enjoyed great success in some other line of work. Politics is its own set of skills. Just because you owned a hockey team (like <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/general/former-edmonton-oilers-owner-peter-pocklington-sentenced-to-prison-in-california/\">Peter Pocklington, the Edmonton Oilers</a> owner who took a pasting at the hands of Brian Mulroney in the 1983 Progressive Conservative leadership race), or just because you used to play on one (the great Habs goalie Ken Dryden) doesn\u2019t mean you have any kind of future in politics. In fact it\u2019s probably a hindrance, because heavyweights from the real world don\u2019t normally come to politics with the abject humility they\u2019ll need to learn the ropes. Yes, this is one of many reasons why <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/is-kevin-oleary-really-going-to-run-for-conservative-leader/\">Kevin O\u2019Leary</a> should probably keep his day job.</p>\n<p>What does work? Strong opinions and an absolutely mammoth ego. Moderation, an eagerness to round edges, and a need to be liked are all overrated. Too many people won\u2019t like you. It works best if you enjoy it. Exhibit A here is the contrast between Joe Clark, whom everyone liked for decades after he stopped winning, and Stephen Harper, whom almost nobody liked during the decade he was unbeatable. It also helps to have some kind of big idea about what you\u2019re in politics to do. A love of the process for its own sake dooms you to life as a strategist. You really have to want to do something with your time in politics.</p>\n<p>After I had covered politics for many years, I decided it\u2019s also best if a prospective leader has already lost, badly, at least once. Politics deals all its practitioners the occasional crushing disappointment. An ability to bounce back is handy. <a href=\"http://site.macleans.ca/longform/trudeau/\">How, then, to explain a Justin Trudeau?</a> Perhaps it\u2019s that he\u2019s lost more often than we usually reckon. His parents\u2019 marriage fell apart. His brother Michel died young. He\u2019s popular, for now, but maybe popularity isn\u2019t what drives him. Maybe it\u2019s not on the list of things he needs.</p>\n<p>None of this adds up to dependable advice for a party seeking a leader. Trust your gut. If you pick a leader you can\u2019t stand, and then discover voters can\u2019t either, nobody wins. Pick a leader you want to follow. Ideally not Kevin O\u2019Leary.</p>\n<h3>Related viewing</h3>\n\n        <meta itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"PT2M12S\" />\n        <meta itemprop=\"thumbnailUrl\"

/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick</p></div>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a surprise from the Polish newspaper <em>Rzeczpospolita</em> (I read &#8217;em all): An <a href=\"http://www.rp.pl/Wywiady/301139814-Polska-zyska-na-wolnym-handlu.html?template=restricted\">interview with Steve Verheul</a>, Canada&#8217;s lead negotiator for the Canada-EU trade treaty known as CETA. There were many signing ceremonies for this treaty over the last months of Stephen Harper&#8217;s tenure as prime minister, but there&#8217;s been less news about the treaty&#8217;s fate since all the pomp and circumstance faded.</p>\n<p>Verheul&#8217;s interview suggests not everything is hunky-dory. At issue, as anyone could have predicted (and <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/canada-eu-trade-deal-faces-more-tinkering/\">did</a> 10 months ago), is the so-called &#8220;investor-state dispute settlement&#8221; (ISDS) provisions in the trade deal. <a href=\"http://canadians.org/blog/will-new-canada-efta-agreement-also-include-isds-provision\">Here&#8217;s</a> a random blog post from the nationalist Council of Canadians on ISDS provisions. Such concerns have been raised in mirror fashion by any number of trade-skeptical NGOs in Europe.</p>\n<p>Canada&#8217;s embassy in Warsaw was kind enough to have Verheul&#8217;s\u00a0interview <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SdB_dip/status/689823255838998528\">translated</a>; <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CZK-l6UW0AAsLdz.png:large\" target=\"_blank\">here it is</a>, large enough to read. And here&#8217;s what stands out from Verheul&#8217;s comments:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We do not think the agreement needs to be renegotiated. We would like to avoid this. However, we are aware of the fact that ISDS is being debated in Europe. We are open to dialogue on this matter, including some amendments to the contents of CETA, provided that this does not cause the ratification process to be considerably delayed.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Verheul also says the so-called &#8220;legal scrubbing&#8221; to ensure the treaty&#8217;s legal text matches negotiated positions is taking &#8220;a bit longer than assumed.&#8221; But scrubbing&#8217;s nearly done, and will be followed by translation into all the EU&#8217;s many official languages, and then by ratification, first at the community level, and then by national parliaments.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where this ISDS business could cause real trouble. Benefits from enhanced trade are diffuse and not always easy for citizens to notice. Concerns about national sovereignty are localized and easy for NGOs to provoke.

With a little luck, there&#8217;ll be $10 billion in projects listed on Convergence (whose website is <a href=\"https://www.convergence.finance/about?tab=press\">here</a>) over the next five years.</p>\n<p>Convergence reflects a few epiphanies about development assistance that have been rather long coming: that what developing countries want most isn&#8217;t charitable donations, it&#8217;s investment; that private investors in Canada would divert\u00a0at least some of their money to these fast-growing markets if opportunities were made clearer and mechanisms simpler; and that everyone can gain from increasing activity at the intersection of investment and development.</p>\n<p>I know all of this because I started reading about it when it was the Conservative government&#8217;s plan, nearly a year ago. Joe Oliver&#8217;s spring 2015 budget allocated money for the project. <a href=\"https://assets.contentful.com/bbfdx7vx8x8r/4GI9wGJAmsSqAU8CGowi0i/f6d8a153585c4a67124119126a0462ca/Convergence-News-Release-FINAL.pdf\">Here&#8217;s</a> a news release from last July with every element of today&#8217;s announcement: the name, the rationale, the steering committee.</p>\n<p>This is all good, unless you cling to the notion that filthy lucre must not stain the virtue of Africa, in which case I am here to tell you that horse has been\u00a0out of the barn for some time now. It&#8217;s good that Christian Paradis was able to make some yards on this project before he saw the writing on the Conservative Party of Canada&#8217;s wall and decided not to run again. It&#8217;s good that Freeland and Bibeau resisted the urge to cancel this project just because it was on their desks when they got here. It&#8217;s good that international partners as influential as Dalberg, Mastercard and the Gates Foundation see some continuity in Canadian policy.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/chrystia-freeland-unveils-harpers-future-in-davos/\">Chrystia Freeland unveils Harper&#8217;s future in Davos</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/chrystia-freeland-unveils-harpers-future-in-davos/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>3</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The case for keeping Tom Mulcair</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-case-for-keeping-tom-mulcair/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-case-for-keeping-tom-mulcair/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 15:28:29 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Maclean's Voices]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NDP]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NDP leadership]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tom Mulcair]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=821697</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Many NDP insiders want Mulcair to step aside.

I cheated a bit there by taking out the 103-seat breakthrough of 2011, but maybe I should leave it out, as a fluke. The 2011 surprise aside, the party\u2019s rise looks steady and perhaps even inexorable.</p>\n<p>The New Democrats achieved much of that result by sticking with a leader even after disappointments. Jack Layton tasted disappointing results three times before 2011. Each time his party had hoped for a much greater breakthrough than what it got. If he had walked away earlier, he would simply have left another rookie leader to start over again. In Canadian politics, incumbency is usually a greater virtue than novelty. (You will say: But what about Justin Trudeau? I reply: A guy named Trudeau is a poor argument for the winning power of novelty.)</p>\n<p>The NDP does not, today, have an obvious leader-in-waiting who could replace Mulcair. The party\u2019s largest provincial caucus is still in Quebec: which successor from outside the province could speak to those voters? Its deepest traditions of electoral success lie outside Quebec: Which Quebecer could tap into those wellsprings?</p>\n<p>So: an electoral result that\u2019s solidly in line with three of Jack Layton\u2019s four tallies. A leader who has (surely) (I\u2019m guessing here) (but surely) (well, I mean, you\u2019d think) learned from defeat and can apply those lessons. A party that\u2019s hard to govern without perfect command of two official languages, and no active campaign to find that replacement leader.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the case for keeping Mulcair. I\u2019ve made it before, in pieces here and there. The case for replacing him is the one I keep hearing from New Democrats. Unlike me, <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/five-things-to-watch-in-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">they\u2019ll get a vote</a> when the party decides in April whether to call a leadership convention.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/thomas-mulcair-how-hes-ready-to-spar-in-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Mulcair on being ready to spar in 2016\u2014including for his job</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s sort of this hope that he does the right thing,\u201d one prominent New Democrat told me when I called to ask about <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/thomas-mulcair-guarantees-he-will-remain-ndp-leader-in-the-next-election/\" target=\"_blank\">Mulcair\u2019s future</a>. \u201cRight thing,\u201d in this context, means that Mulcair would stand down as leader before April and call for members to elect a new leader at their next opportunity.</p>\n<p>\u201cMembership is pissed,\u201d another New Democrat wrote me in an email.</p>\n<p>A third\u2014and I know I\u2019m not giving you any names; that was the condition for each of my interlocutors to speak freely\u2014admitted to fearing the party will passively accept Mulcair as leader because \u201cNew Democrats don\u2019t like to win.\u201d</p>\n<p>Back to my first anonymous source. \u201cThere are a few angry, angry, angry people,\u201d this person said, \u201cwho I would say are concentrated among the MPs. They\u2019re pinning everything on Mulcair.\u201d This person thinks it\u2019s harsh to blame Mulcair entirely for the loss of 51 seats last October. Justin Trudeau also had something to do with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I would say there\u2019s a growing consensus that Mulcair needs to step aside,\u201d this person continued. \u201cBut there\u2019s no organizing or campaigning going on.\u201d</p>\n<p>The constitutionally mandated leadership review after an election is a simple matter. Delegates to a national convention vote on whether there should be a new leadership convention. In any party, dissatisfaction with the leader is unlikely to crystallize unless there\u2019s a present and available alternative. As of this week the NDP has none. There\u2019s some talk about Alexandre Boulerice, the svelte and bearded MP for Montreal\u2019s Rosemont\u2013La Petite-Patrie riding. He has zero name recognition outside Quebec, and something very close to zero inside. But he is a veritable Kardashian compared to another name put to me: Ryan Meili, an amicable and bearded physician from Saskatoon, who twice finished in second place behind other candidates for the Saskatchewan NDP leadership. So yes, I\u2019m aware that his power base is in Saskatchewan and that he\u2019s never won there. Also I\u2019m aware that everyone I\u2019ve mentioned so far has beards. You have something against beards? Meanwhile, neither of these two is even campaigning; they are somebody else\u2019s idea of potential Mulcair replacements.</p>\n<p>It would be nice if no replacement were needed. With three months to secure his job, <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/how-tom-mulcair-plans-to-oppose-trudeaus-liberals/\" target=\"_blank\">Mulcair</a> should be making friends as fast as he can. How\u2019s that going? \u201cHe\u2019s not romancing anyone, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d my chattiest source said. \u201cThe most natural constituency is his caucus. And he\u2019s being a dick [to them].\u201d How so? \u201cWe had a big caucus after 2011, and the organization was pretty hierarchical. Now it\u2019s far smaller, but he\u2019s still doing that hierarchical thing. Not asking for opinions. Still having that small circle around him. Not treating you like you matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe Mulcair will launch his charm offensive when the House returns at the end of January. Maybe he has no need to charm anyone. With no credible replacement, his opponents may well fold their tents. That\u2019s not an ideal campaign slogan for 2019, but you make do with what you\u2019ve got.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-case-for-keeping-tom-mulcair/\">The case for keeping Tom Mulcair</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-case-for-keeping-tom-mulcair/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>20</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>World-class whine: Why Ottawa&#8217;s haters are wrong</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/world-class-whine-why-ottawas-haters-are-wrong/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/world-class-whine-why-ottawas-haters-are-wrong/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2016 21:07:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Andrew Cohen]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=822717</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>If Ottawa isn't like other capitals, writes Paul Wells, it's because Canada isn't like other countries</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/world-class-whine-why-ottawas-haters-are-wrong/\">World-class whine: Why Ottawa&#8217;s haters are wrong</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-738501\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080.jpg\" alt=\"13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-660x371.jpg 660w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-680x383.jpg 680w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-360x203.jpg 360w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-510x287.jpg 510w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-270x152.jpg 270w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-640x360.jpg 640w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-123x69.jpg 123w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-273x154.jpg 273w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080-650x366.jpg 650w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13639244001_4306770221001_FINAL-RideauSkate-1920x1080.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></a></p>\n<p>My friend Andrew Cohen is vexed that the city of Ottawa will not widen the airport parkway, as we call the two-lane road out to the airport. Sorely vexed, ladies and gentlemen! The <em>Ottawa Citizen</em> columnist\u2014former <em>Globe</em> editorialist, award-winning author, one-time resident of Washington and Berlin\u2014gets vexed about Ottawa every several months, and this latest failure to widen the \u201cheavily congested\u201d parkway, a \u201ccritical, clogged artery,\u201d has set him off once again.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor its lack of ambition and absence of imagination, Ottawa is the worst capital in the G7,\u201d Cohen wrote in <a href=\"http://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/cohen-ottawa-is-the-worst-capital-city-in-the-g7\" target=\"_blank\">what quickly became the most-read article in the <em>Citizen</em> this week</a>. \u201cIt is unable to get anything done very quickly, whether repairing a ceremonial thoroughfare like Sussex Drive or building light rail, which will arrive decades after other cities.\u201d</p>\n<p>By this point, longtime Cohen readers can more or less sing along. \u201cFor mediocrity, there\u2019s Lansdowne Park,\u201d Cohen writes. \u201cA (nice) stadium, shops, restaurants and condos, with a park and a wading pool as consolation.\u201d Doesn\u2019t sound tragic, although there is in fact <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/lansdowne-park-water-feature-still-confuses-some-despite-new-signs-1.3180778\">no wading pool</a>. \u201cIt replaces a sea of cracked asphalt and a crumbling stadium, and for contented Ottawans, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Ah. Good. Yes?</p>\n<p>No. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not interesting, let alone innovative.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah. \u201cAnd we squandered a once-in-a-century chance to remake Ottawa\u2019s image, for example to do for our city what the Guggenheim Museum did for Bilbao, Spain.\u201d Here one hears the far-off plaintive call of logic, as one so often does when reading an Andrew Cohen rant about Ottawa, because I am pretty sure Bilbao is not a G7 capital. But <em>passons</em>. There are the obligatory to-be-sure paragraphs, in which Cohen allows a few scraps of hope to drift into his readers\u2019 minds\u2014\u201cLight rail is coming, though it won\u2019t stop in Confederation Square. The brutalist National Arts Centre is getting a new glass facade, and will no longer look like a Stalinist detention centre\u201d\u2014before crushing the hope with a summary graf.</p>\n<p>Like this: Whatever else Ottawa may be, he writes, it sure isn\u2019t \u201ca modern, progressive capital, a repository of history and culture, a reflection of our achievements and dreams as a nation.\u201d So weep for the critical arteries, Ottawans!</p>\n<p>It is good to be consistent. This week\u2019s rant follows many, many previous columns from the Cohen pen, including \u201c<a href=\"http://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/andrew-cohen-a-library-renovation-passes-for-vision-in-ottawa\">What passes for vision in Ottawa is simply complacent creativity</a>,\u201d from Oct. 15, 2014 (\u201cWe do not know how to make the Ottawa River and the Rideau Canal more interesting\u201d); \u201cOttawa a capital in name only,\u201d from Sept. 1, 2013 (\u201cA toy capital pretending to be a real one\u201d); \u201cCanadians don&#8217;t love Ottawa,\u201d from Nov. 29, 2011 (\u201cEncourage innovative street vendors and different street food\u201d); \u201cThe trouble with Ottawa is Ottawans,\u201d from Aug. 18, 2011 (\u201cOttawa wouldn\u2019t know a new idea\u2014let alone a big idea\u2014if it was accosted by one\u201d); \u201cA city waiting to grow up,\u201d from Oct. 26, 2010 (\u201cthe ByWard Market remains uncovered\u201d); \u201cA city that has given up,\u201d from May 10, 2007 (\u201cMoney marts patronized by drifters\u201d); \u201cThe capital of condescension,\u201d from Feb. 14, 2006 (\u201ca town without climax\u201d); and \u201cA great city if only it tried,\u201d from May 17, 2005 (\u201cSomething about giving up and not bothering\u201d).</p>\n<p>It is hard to avoid repetition. Cohen wrote that\u00a0the National Arts Centre resembles \u201ca Stalinist interrogation centre,\u201d in those words precisely, in five separate columns published in 2007, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2016. I worry about taste. Here\u2019s what happened in Stalinist interrogation centres: people were tortured to death. Pretty frequently. Tonight at\u00a0the NAC, the family of a former prime minister will hear a <a href=\"http://nac-cna.ca/en/event/11258\">bold new composition</a> by a Canadian composer whose music is widely performed outside Canada, following a <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/macleans-live-truth-reconciliation-and-arts-ability-to-heal/\">panel discussion on reconciliation</a> with First Nations attended by author Joseph Boyden and Sophie Gr\u00e9goire-Trudeau. The pageantry is almost secondary to the work <a href=\"http://alexandershelley.com/\">Alexander Shelley</a>, the best young British orchestral conductor of his generation, has done to revitalize what was already a fantastic orchestra. Increasingly these days, if you\u2019re not at the NAC on a school night, that\u2019s your problem. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening in Rome tonight, but I don\u2019t feel particularly cheated.</p>\n<p>Cohen has a larger theme, which I\u2019ll get to. But words matter, and the awesome pettiness of his whinging is breathtaking to behold. It is true the new light-rail network, being built on time and on budget under the guidance of\u00a0a mayor who has consistently been beneath Cohen\u2019s contempt, will not stop at Confederation Square. It will stop 600 m west of Confederation Square. Then it will stop again, 300 m east of Confederation Square. This will make Confederation Square nearly impossible to reach by any LRT rider who is encased in an iron lung. Cohen wonders why Ottawa \u201ccannot produce better, more reasonable restaurants.\u201d How do greater cities produce such marvels? Do they excrete them? Better restaurants generally cost more, and I\u2019m not sure readers outside Ottawa will shed a tear at the news that when I eat at such dynamite Ottawa venues as <a href=\"http://frasercafe.ca/\">Fraser Caf\u00e9</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thewhalesbone.com/\">Whalesbone</a>, <a href=\"http://www.beckta.com/\">Beckta</a> or <a href=\"http://www.gezelligdining.ca/\">Gezellig</a>, I am generally asked to pay before leaving. Meanwhile, if we\u2019re being honest, a lot of Paris bistros are horror shows. A lunch of wilted sushi in London will set you back half a week\u2019s pay. You want to eat well in Washington, you pay K Street prices. Now, Washington does have better jazz clubs, but the last time I was at Twins Jazz on U Street somebody was getting shot in the discotheque downstairs. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re even having this conversation.</p>\n<p>But of course the real complaint of most people who find Ottawa disappointing is not that it refuses to build a train station within six feet of a specified\u00a0bullseye, or that it has not yet slipped the surly bonds of\u00a0basic restaurant economics. It is that Ottawa\u00a0has no Champs Elys\u00e9es, no British Museum, no Lincoln Memorial, no Coliseum ruins. It does not have a very large number of the sort of things that make one feel impressed with oneself when one realizes one resides in a Place that Matters.</p>\n<p>There are reasons for this. They are obvious. They are the sort of thing one might finally bother to acknowledge, when taking one\u2019s 40th\u00a0run at the same topic.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-724909\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439.jpg\" alt=\"Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439\" width=\"660\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439.jpg 660w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439-360x239.jpg 360w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439-120x80.jpg 120w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439-510x339.jpg 510w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439-270x180.jpg 270w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439-541x360.jpg 541w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439-123x82.jpg 123w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439-273x182.jpg 273w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ottawa-Getty-Images-Michele-Falzone-660x439-650x432.jpg 650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" /></p>\n<p>Ottawa does not have wide boulevards because the capitals that do were built by autocratic rulers who hoped at some point to march a victorious army down those boulevards. Paris, London, Rome and Berlin (!) have all, at many points in their very long histories, been war capitals. Washington was designed at a time when Americans were not yet entirely sure whether they wanted to shun imperialist European models or copy\u00a0them. Tokyo and Berlin were relatively easy to rebuild along impressive lines because they were shattered at brutal human cost as the price of launching a world war. On a single March night in 1945, <a href=\"http://time.com/3718981/tokyo-firebombing-1945/\">700,000 firebombs</a> fell on Tokyo, killing untold tens of thousands and levelling an area much larger than that of present-day Ottawa. This is an actual thing that happened. It directly influenced Tokyo\u2019s development for decades to come. I\u2019m OK with a capital that still adheres to the humble grid of its lumber-town origins.</p>\n<p>Cohen worries that Ottawa is not innovative in \u201crecovered green space.\u201d It depends where you look. Gatineau Park is 105 times the size of Central Park in Manhattan and 172 times the size of Berlin\u2019s Grosser Tiergarten. I suppose if it were only triple their size he might have a point. Wait, no he wouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Onward. Unlike almost every other G7 capital, Ottawa is not the capital of a unitary state that spent decades under an authoritarian ruler who extorted\u00a0tithes from the hinterland to build monuments to his greater glory. Napoleon, Bismarck (to pick the most polite of available German options), the Caesars, the Windsors: Handy when you\u2019re building a tourist hotspot of the future. Ottawa is the capital of a federation, as are such sleepy burgs as Canberra, Brasilia, Bonn\u2014because for decades, Bonn was West Germany\u2019s capital\u2014and, indeed, Washington in the years before lobby money started to sluice down that city\u2019s streets.</p>\n<p>To say that Ottawa is a federal capital and shouldn\u2019t be home to most of the country\u2019s class or prestige is not to make an excuse for a weakness, it is to give a name to a strength. I know federalism is tiresome for people who find a two-block walk to Confederation Square daunting, but there is a reason why federations are over-represented among the world\u2019s most prosperous countries, and I really don\u2019t feel cheated, as an Ottawan, when I visit the Winnipeg Art Gallery or the Art Gallery of Ontario or the Citadelle in Quebec City or the Ship Pub in St. John\u2019s. We built our Canada where Canadians live, and since they live all over, we built it all over. It was one of \u201cour achievements and dreams as a nation,\u201d to coin a phrase, to do precisely\u00a0that.</p>\n<p>Canada is also a country with, by and large, a long and profound attachment to the liberal European idea that the state needn\u2019t build monuments to itself because it would prefer to invest in citizens\u2019 human capital when it is not simply letting them keep more of the money they earned.</p>\n<p>Paris is the ancient capital of Jacobin central planners, dotted with museums and cultural landmarks built, in many cases, not as odes to France\u2019s genius but as mementoes from presidents nearing their term limits. Many are white elephants, like the Bastille opera house that never gets mentioned on anyone\u2019s list of things Ottawa should copy. Washington\u2019s monuments are lovely, but the finest of them remembers a president who was gunned down in the last days of a devastating civil war. And its finer restaurants do a better job of mocking the American dream than of celebrating it.</p>\n<p>Ottawa is looking a bit dog-eared these days. Of course: it has come through a nasty few decades. Brian Mulroney and Jean Chr\u00e9tien spent a decade cauterizing a ruinous public-debt spiral. Most of Stephen Harper\u2019s decade was about coping with the aftermath of the worst global financial crisis in my lifetime. Justin Trudeau is eager to patch up Montreal\u2019s highways before more of them fall on somebody. Which project should we have postponed\u00a0for quicker access to Ottawa\u2019s airport? Which, incidentally, is 15 minutes from downtown by taxi. I promise you there is no easier airport to reach in the G7, except for Reagan National, a permanent monument to the U.S. Congress\u2019s ability to safeguard its own prerogatives.</p>\n<p>In earlier columns, Cohen used to complain that Ottawa had no light rail. It is being built. He didn\u2019t like the NAC. It is being <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/ottawas-national-arts-centre-set-for-a-facelift/\">spectacularly refurbished</a>. He worried for the library. On the day his most recent column was published, the National Archives announced plans to work with the Ottawa Public Library on a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-public-library-library-and-archives-canada-working-together-on-new-central-branch-1.3400935\">new downtown showcase</a>. He was upset that the big hockey rink is a half hour from downtown. Plans to return it downtown are well advanced. Meanwhile, I return from Los Angeles, where some locals were buzzing about Janet Cardiff\u2019s art installation <a href=\"https://www.gallery.ca/en/see/exhibitions/current/details/janet-cardiff-forty-part-motet-6857\">Forty-Part Motet</a>, created at Canada\u2019s National Gallery, and others were lining up for a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/lawren-harris-steve-martin-1.3265270\">Lawren Harris retrospective</a> curated by the comedian Steve Martin, using paintings on loan from the same National Gallery.</p>\n<p>If Ottawa is not full to brimming with the plunder of empire, if it is forced to share its glories with residents of provincial capitals across a continent, if it has fewer marble monuments in a country with more happy citizens, I\u2019m not sure it stands as any kind of failure or disappointment. I know a writer who used to admit as much. \u201cIt is unfair to compare Ottawa to Washington, Paris, London, Vienna or Rome, great imperial cities which are, or were, the cockpit of Empire and the hub of their universe,\u201d Andrew Cohen wrote in the <em>Ottawa Citizen</em> on Aug. 4, 2002. Back then he thought the National Arts Centre conferred \u201ca sense of presence.\u201d If any part of Ottawa is getting seriously worn out, it is certainly the tired rhetoric of its most dedicated Cassandra.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/world-class-whine-why-ottawas-haters-are-wrong/\">World-class whine: Why Ottawa&#8217;s haters are wrong</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/world-class-whine-why-ottawas-haters-are-wrong/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>38</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Life after &#8216;Let&#8217;s Dance&#8217;: Paul Wells on David Bowie</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/life-after-lets-dance-paul-wells-on-david-bowie/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/life-after-lets-dance-paul-wells-on-david-bowie/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 23:00:29 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Arts]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[David Bowie]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=820491</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>His career lasted 30 years after the classics.

(Evening Standard/Getty Images)</p></div>\n<p>In an interview for a supplement to <i>Lucky</i> magazine to mark the 2005 Fashion Rocks charity show in New York City, the journalist David Itzkoff asked David Bowie about the name he was given at birth\u2014about his identity, if you will. \u201cThis may sound like a very esoteric question,\u201d Itzkoff asked, \u201cbut does the persona of David Jones still exist within you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bowie replied. \u201cThe Bowie character, for me, is strictly to be used for the stage, so I can hide back away as David Jones. Right now, in the mountains, where I am at the moment, it&#8217;s David Jones. With my family I am David Jones, very much.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a point worth repeating about Bowie, <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/iconic-singer-david-bowie-dies-at-69/\" target=\"_blank\">who died on Sunday</a> two days after he released his final album, <i>Blackstar</i>: At every point in his career, the face he showed the world was a face he had chosen and carefully constructed. This was, to a great extent, the point of him. It was much of what his admirers found personally liberating in his example: that identity can be freely selected and asserted, whether it\u2019s musical, political, visual, or any other kind of identity. At no point after perhaps 1972 was it even particularly useful to ask where the \u201creal\u201d Bowie ended and \u201cthe Bowie character\u201d began. He was who he chose to be. When his choices or the cultural moment changed, so did he.</p>\n<p>This was at least as true in the long aftermath of his most successful album, 1983\u2019s <em>Let\u2019s Dance</em>, as it was before, when Bowie was more ostentatiously a member of rock\u2019s experimental underground. His early years are getting most of the attention in the wake of his death. This is as it should be: his albums from the 1970s were consistently daring and managed to become, almost despite their audacity, the soundtrack for a decade.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The ultimate Bowie playlist:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/the-man-who-fell-to-earth-the-ultimate-david-bowie-playlist/\" target=\"_blank\">His 20 most important songs, and why they matter</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>But while he had legions of fans who prefer to act as though nothing that mattered came after <i>Diamond Dogs</i> and <i>Low</i>, Bowie himself didn\u2019t really have that luxury. He had to live through the three decades after the Serious Moonlight tour ended, a day at a time. He chose to reject nostalgia and to keep reinventing himself, again and again, from assorted motley shards of the zeitgeist. The construction of \u201cthe Bowie character\u201d was always a work in progress.</p>\n<p>Not that <i>Let\u2019s Dance</i> didn\u2019t knock him for a loop. Its worldwide sales were well north of seven million copies. He had never had an<span class=\"s1\">\u00a0audience that large. Nor any that distracted: before 1983, the complexity of his assorted personas would have made it difficult for anyone to be a casual Bowie fan, but suddenly his admirers\u00a0were legion. He freely admitted to <i>Rolling Stone </i>that the goal of the next album, <i>Tonight</i>, was \u201cto keep my hand in, so to speak,\u201d with that mass audience. The results, on <i>Tonight</i> and 1987\u2019s <i>Never Let Me Down</i>, were mixed at best: a couple of disposable hit singles, a reggae-tinged ballad duet with Tina Turner, a (strikingly sombre) Beach Boys cover. One track featured the actor Mickey Rourke rapping. It was all caked in layers of MTV-era studio processing, with plenty of gated reverb on the drums. Already by 1987 Bowie was weary of trying to please a crowd. \u201cI stayed away from experimentation,\u201d he told <i>Rolling Stone </i>mournfully. \u201cNow, I think I should be a bit more adventurous.\u201d </span></p>\n<p>He would be as good as his word. He executed his return to a life of experimentation in three steps. First, in 1989, Tin Machine released their first album. This was, the members insisted, a real band, one whose singer just happened to be David Bowie. (The others included the sons of television comic Soupy Sales, Hunt Sales on drums and Tony Sales on bass.) Tin Machine never amounted to much, but it sounds better in retrospect than it did at the time, because despite the Italian suits the guys wore on their first album cover, their rough, guitar-driven sound foreshadowed the grunge rock of the \u201990s with uncanny foresight.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_820605\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-820605\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST4.jpg\" alt=\"British Pop Star David Bowie screams into the microphone as he performs on stage during his concert in Vienna.

(Leonhard Foeger/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>In 1990, Bowie formally turned the page, not just on the hits from <em>Let\u2019s Dance</em>, but on almost his entire career to date. He launched his Sound + Vision Tour with an extended series of concerts across Canada before continuing around the world. The conceit of Sound + Vision was simple: He would play his hits, all of them from across the years. But then he would never feel an obligation to play any of them again. He was 43 years old.</p>\n<p>In 1993 he released his first solo album in five years, <i>Black Tie White Noise</i>. On paper it looked like yet another attempt to capture the <i>Let\u2019s Dance</i> lightning in a bottle, because it was co-produced, as that hit was, by Bowie and guitarist-producer Nile Rodgers. Instead <i>Black Tie</i> inhabited a sonic universe with little precedent or peer: austere, synthetic and chilly, closer to house music than rock, but with radiant melodies and vocals from the newly married Bowie. It didn\u2019t sound any more like classic Bowie than it did like the CDs on either side of it at Tower Records. It was sui generis.</p>\n<p>From there on in, even when Bowie reconnected with past collaborators, the results didn\u2019t sound like their earlier work. 1995\u2019s <i>Outside </i>paired him with Brian Eno, his producer on the \u201970s milestones <i>Low</i> and <i>Heroes</i>, but it was a dystopian concept album that resembled them in no particular way. <i>Earthling</i>, from 1997, surrounded Bowie with the hyperkinetic jungle and drum \u2019n\u2019 bass grooves of the era\u2019s dance-club music. Sometimes sounds Bowie had swiped from the dance clubs would find their way back: \u201cHallo Spaceboy,\u201d from <em>Outside</em>, was a hit in a remix by Pet Shop Boys. \u201cAnd I want to be free,\u201d Bowie sang, \u201cDon&#8217;t you want to be free?/ Do you like girls or boys?/ It&#8217;s confusing these days.\u201d</p>\n<p>He ended his epic career with a one-two combination that would stand comparison with\u00a0his most satisfying work from any era. <i>The Next Day</i>, from 2013, was a return to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, raggedy and elemental in the manner of his \u201970s classics, and it came by it honestly because it was produced by Tony Visconti, who had worked with Bowie off and on since <i>Space Oddity</i>.</p>\n<p><i>The Next Day</i> was a surprise when it arrived. The release of a first single for sale on iTunes was the first anyone had heard of it. Maybe listeners should have realized Bowie\u00a0was not done surprising us. Last week\u2019s release of <i>Blackstar</i> was the final masterstroke from a genius of self-creation. Since Sunday night, combing the album\u2019s lyrics for hints of its author\u2019s demise has become a grim cottage industry, and it\u2019s easy work: \u201cLook up here, I\u2019m in heaven,\u201d he sings at the top of the second single, \u201cLazarus.\u201d Well, he did know he had cancer for 18 months, after all.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_820485\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-820485\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2.jpg\" alt=\"A still from David Bowie's video for &quot;Lazarus.&quot;\" width=\"822\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2-300x167.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2-660x368.jpg 660w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2-680x379.jpg 680w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2-360x201.jpg 360w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2-120x67.jpg 120w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2-510x284.jpg 510w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2-270x150.jpg 270w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2-640x357.jpg 640w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2-273x152.jpg 273w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2-650x362.jpg 650w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC03_BOWIE_POST2.jpg 822w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A still from David Bowie&#8217;s video for &#8220;Lazarus.&#8221;</p></div>\n<p>What\u2019s at least as striking is the album\u2019s musical content. Yet again, <em>Blackstar</em> sounds not much like anything else Bowie had done. Bowie and Visconti managed the trick by recruiting the New York jazz saxophonist Donny McCaslin and McCaslin\u2019s entire band. What\u2019s striking is how little <i>Blackstar</i> sounds like McCaslin\u2019s own recent albums, full of the fussy athleticism that characterizes too much of today\u2019s jazz. <i>Blackstar</i> is altogether more brutish, glowering and direct. Bowie hired these outsiders to execute his concepts, not theirs, and one suspects he liked the way they\u00a0approached the task\u00a0without the glib facility of longtime associates.</p>\n<p>One reason those classic records from the \u201970s sounded as raw as they did was because in that bygone era, everything was new to everyone. Every player had to answer the basic questions from scratch: What\u2019s the function of the drums? What should the guitar sound like? Where do the accents land in a 4/4 bar? <em>Blackstar</em> conjures that freshness and exploratory spirit with starkly different means. Bowie knew he was dying, it\u2019s obvious. He decided he\u2019d approach his last challenge, the one he could not surmount, as he\u2019d met so many others: by building \u201cthe Bowie character\u201d from scratch, as he\u2019d done so many times before, reassuring and unknowable, familiar and new. \u201cOh, I&#8217;ll be free/ Just like that bluebird,\u201d he sings in \u201cLazarus.&#8221; \u201cOh, I&#8217;ll be free/ Ain&#8217;t that just like me?\u201d And indeed it was.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/life-after-lets-dance-paul-wells-on-david-bowie/\">Life after &#8216;Let&#8217;s Dance&#8217;: Paul Wells on David Bowie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/life-after-lets-dance-paul-wells-on-david-bowie/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Why Ottawa should resist the urge to be helpful</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-ottawa-should-resist-the-urge-to-be-helpful/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-ottawa-should-resist-the-urge-to-be-helpful/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2016 15:46:58 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[innovation]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kirsty Duncan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Navdeep Bains]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=818491</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>'Real change' doesn't happen overnight\u2014or without the necessary funds</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-ottawa-should-resist-the-urge-to-be-helpful/\">Why Ottawa should resist the urge to be helpful</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_818905\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC02_WELLS_CAROUSEL01.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC02_WELLS_CAROUSEL01.jpg\" alt=\"Pages and staff prepare the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada, December 2, 2015.

(Chris Wattie/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>Some things are taking longer than people hoped. Syrian refugees, for instance. I wrote this column on Jan. 5, and the federal government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/welcome/\">handy website</a> told me 6,300 Syrian refugees had arrived in Canada. The number will grow. It did not reach 25,000 by the last day of 2015 (Justin Trudeau\u2019s campaign promise) or even 10,000 (his first goal after his government was sworn in) unless some of those Syrians bring time machines.</p>\n<p>Staffing up the offices of government is taking time too. The Liberals launched a <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-very-liberal-hiring-policy/\">website for job applicants</a>, and put word out a few days later that they had received 20,000 applications. Apparently none of those people applied for a job processing job applications from random Internet people. There is a bottleneck. There is still tumbleweed blowing through most ministers\u2019 offices. It won\u2019t last. Growing pains, is all.</p>\n<p>At the end of the month, MPs will return to the House of Commons. Sort of: <a href=\"http://www.parl.gc.ca/housechamberbusiness/chambercalendar.aspx?Language=E\">The Parliamentary calendar for 2016</a>, which the Liberals inherited from the Conservatives, is one of the lightest in a decade. MPs will return at the end of January for two weeks, then take a week off. Then back for two weeks, then a week off. Back for another week, then a week off. Another week on, then two weeks off. Through the end of March, the House will sit for one-third fewer days than in a typical year. It will be May before MPs stay in town for three consecutive weeks. The new government needed the assent of all parties to change the 2016 calendar. It couldn\u2019t get them to agree. The calendar will bottleneck Trudeau\u2019s ambition almost until summer.</p>\n<p>Money will be a constraint long after. Briefing notes prepared for Trudeau, the Canadian Press <a href=\"http://www.newstalk1010.com/news/2016/01/05/briefing-notes-federal-government-needs-to-do-better-job-of-connecting-with-you\">reported</a>, warn him he will be working in an environment characterized by \u201ccomplex policy, rapid technological change, limited finances and increasing demands for citizen involvement.\u201d Complexity, speed and openness will tend to make government more expensive. Limited finances\u2014limited in large part by Conservative GST cuts Trudeau is loath to reverse\u2014will make it hard to pay for.</p>\n<p>This will be sad news for the caravans of petitioners now making their way toward Ottawa to seek a cut of Trudeau\u2019s sunny ways. The cupboards are bare. Or rather, their contents are spoken for: There will be billions for infrastructure, billions more for new child bene\ufb01ts, smaller amounts to combat climate change and make good things happen in First Nations communities. Bills that big leave little for other projects.</p>\n<p>This is important context for two of the government\u2019s new ministers, Navdeep Bains and Kirsty Duncan. Duncan is the minister of science. Bains is the minister of innovation, science and economic development. In the old days we would have called him the minister of industry.</p>\n<p>A stink bomb landed on both ministers\u2019 desks at the end of November. It was the <a href=\"http://www.stic-csti.ca/eic/site/stic-csti.nsf/eng/00088.html\">biennial report</a> of the government\u2019s own <a href=\"http://www.stic-csti.ca/eic/site/stic-csti.nsf/eng/Home\">Science, Technology and Innovation Council</a>, composed of experts from universities, business and the civil service. It tells such a distressing story about the performance of science and the innovation performance of business that the Conservatives postponed the report\u2019s release until after the election.</p>\n<p>\u201cCanada has fallen behind its global competition on key performance indicators,\u201d the report says, \u201creflected most tellingly in business investment in research and development.\u201d By most measures, Canada has been falling behind comparable countries in private sector R&amp;D for a decade. While it still produces world-leading scientists in many fields, its talent base has shown \u201cmild erosion\u201d as highly mobile researchers begin to look outside Canada\u2019s borders for their future, the report said.</p>\n<p>Turning those worrisome trends around without spending a lot of money will be a nice challenge. This government could help by simply getting out of researchers\u2019 way. The Harper government targeted research funding ever more narrowly, funding \u201cresearch into Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d as though a government could know, in advance, which breakthroughs in molecular biology would help combat Alzheimer\u2019s and which won\u2019t. Un-targeting that targeted funding would free more scientists to do more science instead of paperwork.</p>\n<p>The Liberals could also resist the urge to be helpful. This week Bains visited a monument to governments\u2019 urge to help: the <a href=\"https://www.marsdd.com/\">MARS Discovery District</a> building in Toronto. It was an attempt by Ontario\u2019s governments, Conservative and Liberal in quick succession, to solve a problem: not enough Canadian businesses implement new ideas and technologies. So the government and the University of Toronto would make a building in downtown Toronto. Businesses that implement new ideas and technologies could move in. Too few have, and taxpayers are still learning about all the ways they have paid to fill the building over the years.</p>\n<p>No new business that was free to make its own choices would move into a downtown Toronto office building, with traffic jams on every side. You might as well ask a business to lift its product in buckets from a well. MARS was built within sight of the Ontario legislature, as a handy reminder of the limits of politicians\u2019 vision.</p>\n<p>The urge to complicate comes naturally to politicians. Bains and Duncan must do something harder: simplify. If they can do that, they won\u2019t need much money. If they can\u2019t, more money won\u2019t help.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-ottawa-should-resist-the-urge-to-be-helpful/\">Why Ottawa should resist the urge to be helpful</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-ottawa-should-resist-the-urge-to-be-helpful/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>19</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The quagmire of electoral reform and the hunt for legitimacy</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-quagmire-of-electoral-reform-and-the-hunt-for-political-legitimacy/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-quagmire-of-electoral-reform-and-the-hunt-for-political-legitimacy/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2015 17:25:37 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[electoral reform]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[liberal party of canada]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=815887</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>A referendum may not be the answer.

(Mathieu Belanger/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>To proceed with electoral reform, I asked Justin Trudeau before Christmas, \u201cDo you think that your government needs to demonstrate support that\u2019s broader than the Liberal caucus in Parliament?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d the Prime Minister said. \u201cI think we need to engage with Canadians, and I know the question\u2019s leading toward, \u2018Do we need a referendum on that?\u2019 We\u2019ve committed to consulting broadly as many Canadians as possible, as many different communities and organizations\u2014including political parties\u2014as possible, and we\u2019re going to move forward with that and we\u2019ll see where it takes us.\u201d</p>\n<p>I like the first two words of that answer best. The rest was mush, though I don\u2019t think it was entirely meaningless. It\u2019s easy to understand why Trudeau believed I was \u201cleading toward\u201d a question on referendums. Everyone is asking him about referendums. Trudeau spent the election campaign promising that 2015\u2019s would be the last federal election held under the familiar first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the largest number of votes in every riding wins a seat in the House of Commons. He has not specified which system should replace it.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/vote-fixing-the-liberal-plan-for-electoral-reform-in-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">The Liberals&#8217; plan to fix the way we vote</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Conservatives, temporarily meek about criticizing Trudeau on more value-laden matters, have latched onto electoral reform as a low-cost way to harry Trudeau. On the last sitting day of Parliament before Christmas, four Conservative MPs demanded a referendum. Scott Reid, the eastern Ontario MP, has launched a petition urging one. At this writing he\u2019s collected about 4,000 signatures\u2014maybe not a groundswell.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/rona-ambrose-how-she-plans-to-build-bridges-in-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">Rona Ambrose sits down for a year-end interview with <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>But concern about Trudeau\u2019s plans isn\u2019t coming only from Conservative dead-enders. The NDP worries the Liberals won\u2019t endorse proportional representation, which would make it impossible for a party to form a majority in Parliament with only 39 per cent of the popular vote, as the Conservatives and Liberals did after the 2011 and 2015 elections.</p>\n<p>There is, you see, more than one way to reform an electoral system. First-past-the-post, the system we have, is easy to understand but it exaggerates the winning party\u2019s advantage. It\u2019s routine for a party to win a majority of seats without winning a majority of votes. Smaller parties get shortchanged. But you could \u201creform\u201d that system by introducing a ranked ballot, where voters\u2019 second and third choices help determine the winner. Such systems tend to reward centrist parties: If you love the Floating Wing-nut Party but you are willing to live with a Liberal, your ranked ballot will probably help elect a Liberal. To reformers whose goal is a proportional system, which would give 10 per cent of the seats to a party winning 10 per cent of the vote, ranked ballots are no improvement.</p>\n<p>Are the Liberals required to hold a referendum before changing the voting system? Not by law. Maybe not by any standard. National referendums are exceedingly rare in Canada. We had one in 1898 on prohibition, another in 1944 on compulsory\u00a0military service, and a third in 1992 on the Charlottetown constitutional accord. There was no referendum on the 1982 Constitution, which Charlottetown sought to amend. There is no rule, nor even a coherent standard of practice, to determine which changes get sent directly to the people and which don\u2019t. In 2001, New Brunswick had a referendum on video lottery terminals. In 2004, Nova Scotia had a referendum on Sunday shopping, then ignored the result. There\u2019s nothing magic about letting the people decide. Often they don\u2019t decide. Often they think they have, but governments do something else anyway.</p>\n<p>There are laws in British Columbia and Alberta that require referendums before the provincial legislatures ratify constitutional amendments. But a change to the electoral system falls well short of that standard of importance.

(Adrian Wyld/CP)</p></div>\n<p>But it\u2019s a bit short to say the Liberals are allowed to rig the electoral system because the Conservatives did. In fact, Liberal House leader Dominic LeBlanc has said something close to the opposite. <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeaus-pointman-in-the-house-on-electoral-reform/\" target=\"_blank\">In an interview with <em>Maclean\u2019s</em>,</a> he called Harper\u2019s so-called Fair Elections Act \u201can example where a majority was changing the rules that affected everybody over the vociferous, and, I think, compelling arguments of those that opposed it. I hope and believe that that\u2019s not where we end up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, then. How could LeBlanc ensure his government doesn\u2019t end up like the Conservatives? He could ensure it meets a higher standard of public approval for its reforms. Hence my question to Trudeau. How could he show that his proposed changes, whatever they may be, aren\u2019t just a mechanism for helping Liberals win more elections? He could get another party to vote for his plan in Parliament. He could line up a number of provincial governments\u2019 approval. He could even hold a referendum. Political legitimacy isn\u2019t binary: it\u2019s not something you either have or you don\u2019t. It\u2019s a sliding scale\u2014the more approval you gather, the more you show you\u2019re changing the system for Canadians, and not just for the Liberal party.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-quagmire-of-electoral-reform-and-the-hunt-for-political-legitimacy/\">The quagmire of electoral reform and the hunt for legitimacy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-quagmire-of-electoral-reform-and-the-hunt-for-political-legitimacy/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>22</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Paul Wells: The music I liked in 2015</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/paul-wells-what-i-listened-to-in-2015/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/paul-wells-what-i-listened-to-in-2015/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2015 07:40:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Arts]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Best of 2015]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Branford Marsalis]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bryan Adams]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Geoff Nuttall]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Maria Schneider]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Missed It List]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[music]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ryan Adams]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=815905</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells missed out on our 2015 Missed It List.

So I missed my chance to contribute. Sorry, Adrian. On Twitter, however, a few people asked what I liked in music in 2015.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s what I heard that I liked. Recorded music first, then live concert performances. Genre allocations are all over the map, but I spend most of my time listening to classical music these days, followed by jazz, followed by what everyone else listens to. The only criterion here is excellence, on the terms of the chosen idiom.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/best-of-music-in-2015/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> critics pick their best music of 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>RECORDINGS</h3>\n<p><strong>Maria Schneider, <i>The Thompson Fields.\u00a0</i></strong>I probably read a half-dozen reviews of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msMMk11gLnM\" target=\"_blank\">latest</a> by the 55-year-old Minnesota-born big-band leader who is the most admired bandleader in large-ensemble jazz. None mentioned that for long stretches of this album\u00a0the Maria Schneider Orchestra barely\u00a0a big band at all. She has 18 musicians on hand, but on several\u00a0tracks she uses only four or five at a time. Often it&#8217;s accordionist Gary Versace, guitarist Lage Lund, pianist Frank Kimbrough and one or two horns. Versace is probably the whole session&#8217;s MVP, and again, nobody I read mentioned that this is an album built from an accordion on up.\u00a0When the winds and brass do come in as a section, it&#8217;s often for washes of sound behind the soloists. Schneider&#8217;s\u00a0music was always delicate, but her mid-career willingness to tighten her focus makes it more\u00a0bracingly intimate than ever.</p>\n<p><strong>Paul Merkelo, <em>French Trumpet Concertos</em>: </strong>Merkelo is the American-born principal trumpet player in the Orchestre symphonique de Montr\u00e9al, and trumpet players know he&#8217;s fiercely talented and proud. His <a href=\"https://analekta.com/assets/medias/2015/02/paulmerkeloCMQ-EN_PROJET.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">most ambitious recording</a> features Merkelo as soloist in front of his orchestra, with Kent Nagano conducting three very French 20th-century concertos. Now, the thing is, no record company wants an album of 20th-century French trumpet concertos, so Merkelo raised the money for the project himself from private donors and a Kickstarter campaign. Why go to the trouble? To establish himself as one of the really great trumpeters. These pieces are <em>hard</em>, and they test a trumpeter&#8217;s endurance. In the old days an album like this would be recorded in several sessions over many days. Merkelo performed them live, in concert, on one night. That&#8217;s just nuts. A lesser man&#8217;s face would fall off.\u00a0And you can ignore that information\u00a0if you like, because his bright sound and rhythmic assurance\u00a0make this memorable as music, not just as athleticism.</p>\n<p><strong>Bryan Adams, <em>You Belong To Me.\u00a0</em></strong>One track, the first, off the rocker&#8217;s new (19th!) album <em>Get Up</em>. The album as a whole is uneven, unfussy, plainly written and recorded in a few days with a small band and no bells or whistles. A tribute, Adams says, to the music that made him want to play for a living when he was a kid. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbiBM1Piy1Q\" target=\"_blank\">opening track</a>\u00a0boots along like a dream, has three or four perfect melodic hooks, and then it&#8217;s done.

The personnel in his band changes \u2014 Justin Faulkner replaced Jeff Watts on drums, Joey Calderazzo replaced Kenny Kirkland on piano, Eric Revis inherited Bob Hurst&#8217;s bass chair \u2014 but the concept is consistent, and the current lineup has been together for half a decade, and in June it all came together with more force and cohesion than I&#8217;ve ever heard.\u00a0Freewheeling, allusive, deeply indebted to blues roots, raucous as a summer storm. Music of absolute conviction.</p>\n<p><strong>The St. Lawrence String Quartet, at the Ottawa International Chamber Music Festival, July.</strong> Founded in Toronto and based at Stanford University since 1999. A bunch of showboaters, as string quartets go, largely thanks\u00a0to first violinist Geoff Nuttall. He grew up in London, Ontario. He&#8217;s gangly,\u00a0boot-clad, the kind of guy who lunges\u00a0bodily into every phrase as though performance were\u00a0exorcism. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/arts/music/geoff-nuttall-the-jon-stewart-of-chamber-music.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">The Jon Stewart of chamber music</a>, the <em>New York Times</em> called him. Cruel but fair. But here&#8217;s the thing: The St. Lawrences love Haydn&#8217;s music, and they settled in for a week to perform it several times, while Nuttall showed up at concerts by a half-dozen <em>other</em> quartets to explain to audiences, with humour and erudition, the Haydn those other bands would\u00a0be playing. Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHJolteDIzc\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> of Nuttall, with colleagues doing this musical evangelism at another venue. Music always needs explainers. Nuttall&#8217;s dedication makes him one of the best.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/paul-wells-what-i-listened-to-in-2015/\">Paul Wells: The music I liked in 2015</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/paul-wells-what-i-listened-to-in-2015/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Justin Trudeau speaks: Risk and opportunity</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-speaks-risk-and-opportunity/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-speaks-risk-and-opportunity/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2015 00:55:58 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Stephen Harper]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=812197</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The PM riles the Baltics.

(Photograph by Blair Gable)</p></div>\n<p>I swear we didn&#8217;t plan to do\u00a0another <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> political television show after that debate in August. That was exhausting. But it also taught\u00a0<em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> to\u00a0work more closely\u00a0with several\u00a0other tentacles\u00a0of the Rogers corporate kraken \u2014 City, Omni, the radio stations and more \u2014 in pursuit of ambitious journalism. Once we&#8217;d built that capability, it was probably inevitable we&#8217;d use it again.</p>\n<p>It just happened\u00a0so\u00a0quickly\u00a0this time, is all. In interviews less than two weeks ago for an article on the Trudeau government&#8217;s operating style, I learned the new Prime Minister was interested in town-hall-style events in addition to his more traditional year-end interviews. We put together a proposal. His office agreed promptly. Canadians saw the result today.</p>\n<p>Organizing the event with the Trudeau PMO was like pushing through a series of open doors. Town hall? Yes, came the prompt answer. Questions off the top from <em>Chatelaine</em> and <em>L&#8217;actualit\u00e9</em>? You bet. Could we invite other news organizations? Sure thing. Scrum afterward? No, sorry, no scrum. But could we send a camera to wherever he&#8217;d be on Monday and shoot promotional video? Absolutely.</p>\n<p>The 60-second version of that promotional video went viral on Monday night, retweeted thousands of times, as people in Pakistan and Japan, Turkey and Mexico (including, as far as I could tell, nearly the entire editorial staff of the<em> Guardian</em>) discovered this young Prime Minister quoting <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em> and, uh, discussing his first pet. A lot of the commentary was amazed. Some was dismissive. The novelty effect won&#8217;t last forever, but it was fascinating to watch.<span id=\"more-812197\"></span></p>\n<p>It was also in the promo video that Trudeau started to get into trouble in some circles, with his remark that picking a favourite Baltic country &#8220;isn&#8217;t a thing.&#8221; Boy, he must not have gone to university where I did. We used to stay up late into the night at Western, debating the merits of Lithuania vs. Latvia. I kid. But of course some viewers were sure he was asserting that the Baltic states themselves are not a thing, and the (surprisingly numerous) defenders of Baltic honour were quick to make themselves heard.</p>\n<p>More trouble, of a sort, will follow his long answer at the actual event to a question about the exclusionary rhetoric of Donald Trump, the alarmingly lifelike windup toy that\u00a0is running for the U.S. Republican presidential nomination. Trudeau&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/politique-canadienne/201512/16/01-4931824-trudeau-fait-un-parallele-entre-trump-et-la-charte-des-valeurs.php\" target=\"_blank\">answer</a> mentioned the so-called Charter of Quebec Values the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ran on in 2014, and ended up calling Trump&#8217;s rhetoric ignorant. This will buy him trouble, in Quebec and perhaps from Trump, that he didn&#8217;t particularly need.</p>\n<p>Now here&#8217;s the thing. The Baltic uprising and the (altogether more predictable) uproar from the PQ are a direct result of Trudeau talking about things he didn&#8217;t need to talk about. We just got done, as a country, with a prime minister who saw such uproars as a good reason not to talk. In his excellent book <em>Harper&#8217;s Team</em>, Tom Flanagan describes a few times when, as Opposition leader in 2002 and 2003, Harper made lame jokes that got him into days of hot water. He eventually decided he could no longer make jokes in public. He developed a reputation for humourlessness that baffled anyone who knew him well. Later he decided it was too dangerous for any Conservative candidate to speak without extensive briefing and vetting. Then, in power, any Canadian diplomat. Then any public servant.</p>\n<p>By 2015, it had become kind of pathetic. Harper went longer without meeting the premiers, as a group, than any prime minister in 90 years. He wouldn&#8217;t meet Ontario&#8217;s premier until he had strong guarantees that nothing would be discussed and he&#8217;d have a hockey game to escape to. He used to have journalists over to 24 Sussex, always in one big group, always with their families, once in spring, once before Christmas.\u00a0In his last year and a half in office he stopped doing that. Don&#8217;t cry for my lot, but in his last campaign, he ensured no human being would get into his campaign events without a prior invitation. Nobody heard him speak who was not already a committed Conservative supporter. He had long since stopped trying to persuade anyone.</p>\n<p>That, in large part, is what brought Harper down, isn&#8217;t it? He was so careful not to hear a discouraging word or make an untoward remark that he had nothing to say and nothing he thought he needed to hear. Conservatives are left today with the disorienting sensation of having little to show for a decade in power because few Canadians have heard why any of it happened. Now, I&#8217;ve written two books about Harper that are often broadly complimentary to him, and I think they hold up well. But it always seemed to me that there was a substantial opportunity cost to all this battening down of hatches. We get a glimpse of it when we see the Conservatives&#8217; interim leader, Rona Ambrose, and long-stymied Conservative MPs like Scott Reid making a strong contribution in the House of Commons. Multiply that by everybody who was kept from making the case, in anything longer than a few dozen inane words at a time, for Conservative ideas over a decade.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Justin Trudeau made the case for his ideas today in front of a live audience and a nation watching on TV and the Internet. Maybe one day his big mouth will get him into the kind of trouble he can&#8217;t get out of. In the meantime Canadians will have a decent idea what he&#8217;s on about. He seems comfortable with that allocation of risk and opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 0; color: #fff;\">Update</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-speaks-risk-and-opportunity/\">Justin Trudeau speaks: Risk and opportunity</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-speaks-risk-and-opportunity/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>14</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>ISIS in Syria: Letter from Washington</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/isis-in-syria-letter-from-washington/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/isis-in-syria-letter-from-washington/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2015 03:55:43 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Harjit Sajjan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ISIS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Syria]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[terrorism]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=810541</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The Americans are writing to allies asking them to do more.

That promise stands, but two months after the October election, the CF-18s are still bombing targets in the region and no date for their return has been set.

November 4, 2015. (Prime Minister&#8217;s Office)</p></div>\n<p>Governments always work at the intersection of the things they want to do and the things that are just going to happen anyway, whether anyone wants them or not. As Justin Trudeau enters his first full calendar year as Canada\u2019s Prime Minister, the traffic at that intersection is getting heavy.</p>\n<p>Here is what he wants to do over the next few months.</p>\n<p>He wants Canada to become home to as many as 25,000 Syrian refugees. In the Ottawa public service, careers are being made and broken as officials work around the clock to figure out how that logistical nightmare can be made to happen. Trudeau needs to appoint new ambassadors to the two most important foreign capitals in the world, Washington and Beijing. The Washington post can\u2019t go to another distinguished elder statesman, one of Trudeau\u2019s advisers told <em>Maclean\u2019s</em>: Canada needs \u201ca lobbyist, essentially,\u201d who can work the shifting factions of a largely Republican Congress, as well as the outgoing President and his replacement. Resuscitating Canada\u2019s relationship with China may be an even greater challenge. Australia will be a model; when Trudeau met in November with the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, they mostly talked about relations with China.</p>\n<p>Trudeau plans his second first-ministers meeting in March. It comes four months after <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/at-the-first-ministers-summit-the-meeting-is-the-message-for-trudeau/\" target=\"_blank\">his first brief meeting with the premiers,</a> which came nearly seven years after the last one Stephen Harper held. It had been 90 years since the federal and provincial governments had gone that long without meeting. Organizing the November meeting \u201cwas hell,\u201d one federal official said. \u201cNobody here remembered how to do them.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Muscle memory is turning out to be a constant challenge for the Trudeau crew as they work with the federal public service to implement their stacked agenda, after Stephen Harper spent a decade trying to dampen bureaucratic enthusiasm. In meetings on refugee resettlement, the Trudeau adviser said, \u201cIt became clear early on that [bureaucrats\u2019] overriding objective was not to get yelled at. We had to say, \u2018Guys, that\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to work.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_799393\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-799393\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/100963931.jpg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sits with Albeta Premier Rachel Notley (left), Prince Edward Island Premier Wade MacLauchlan, Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard, New Brunswick Premier Brian Gallant, B.C.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld</p></div>\n<p>March will also feature a visit with Barack Obama in Washington, which planners expect will be considerably more ambitious than a handshake and coffee. Then a budget, Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u2019s first. It will contain, or be accompanied by, details of the infrastructure plan Liberals believe was key to Trudeau\u2019s election. That plan \u201cis a huge, huge, huge deal,\u201d the Trudeau adviser says. \u201cGetting that right or wrong will go a long way toward determining the public\u2019s thumbs up or down on this government.\u201d</p>\n<p>And in time for Earth Day, April 22, Trudeau and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna will unveil the climate-change plan they are trying to design in co-operation with the provinces.</p>\n<p>Amid all of this, sometime soon, Trudeau\u2019s staff is convinced he needs to get back out of the Ottawa bubble he disdained for most of the two years he was leader of a tiny opposition caucus. \u201cWe gotta get him on the road,\u201d the adviser said.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the plan. Meanwhile there is the constant barrage of the unplanned and the downright unwanted\u2014some of whose contours are already apparent.</p>\n<p>Morneau finally admitted on Dec. 7 that <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/bill-morneau-on-keeping-liberal-promises-im-a-natural-optimist/\" target=\"_blank\">his tax increases on the rich won\u2019t cover the cost of his tax cuts for everyone else.</a> The resulting $1.2-billion hole will be all the harder to cover because, the Parliamentary Budget Office says, economic growth isn\u2019t matching projections. That depresses all government revenues. The dollar\u2019s value is declining. The price of oil is falling faster. The research and innovation performance of Canada\u2019s private sector is lagging badly behind that of other big countries. All of these trends will make it hard to afford anything an ambitious government wants to do. Add in the less wonky horsemen of public administration apocalypse\u2014natural disaster, terrorist attack, scandal\u2014and there will be many days when events will keep Trudeau from striking anything at all off his to-do list. Those are also the days when he\u2019ll be truly tested.</p>\n<h3>Justin Trudeau&#8217;s\u00a0cabinet</h3>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    var minSharesToShow = \"2\";\n    var shareUrl =

ahead, but in early stress tests\u2014<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-nato-and-the-problem-with-backseat-ministering/\" target=\"_blank\">the Paris terrorist massacres,</a> the controversy over <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-the-outrage-over-nannygate-glossed-over-what-we-should-be-talking-about/\" target=\"_blank\">the nannies who accompanied Sophie Gr\u00e9goire-Trudeau to Paris</a>\u2014the new government has already had to manoeuvre through obstacles. It is settling into distinctive habits and attitudes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re a bit like the [Paul] Martin crew,\u201d a longtime observer who has worked closely with several successive federal governments said about the group around Trudeau. \u201cGo go go, all the time. They have a lot to deliver.\u201d But where Martin\u2019s senior staff, collectively nicknamed \u201cthe board,\u201d was emotionally hot and prone to view the latest event, crisis or bit of expert advice as the one that trumped all others, Trudeau so far has managed to take a longer view.</p>\n<p>Part of this is the example set by <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/how-gerald-butts-plans-to-make-justin-trudeau-the-next-prime-minister/\" target=\"_blank\">Gerald Butts, the Prime Minister\u2019s principal secretary and former McGill University roommate.</a> \u201cQuestions like, \u2018How did we get into trouble, isn\u2019t this going to hurt us\u2019\u2014Gerry doesn\u2019t suffer that sort of thing gladly,\u201d another government staffer said.</p>\n<p>But much of the tone comes from the Prime Minister himself. In early group conversations in the Langevin Block where the government\u2019s top political staffers and bureaucratic advisers work, Trudeau has often been the one who cuts conversations about the day\u2019s worries short and reminds others to consider the long-term goal, people familiar with those meetings said.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s got 320 campaign promises, and four years to deliver them, and he really wants to ensure they don\u2019t get off track,\u201d the longtime observer said. And so participants describe a peculiar characteristic of the Trudeau government in its early days: despite the rush to deliver on commitments and the early hiccups of botched plans or unforeseen catastrophe, the general atmosphere has been one of eerie calm.

November 5, 2015. (Adam Scotti/Prime Minister&#8217;s Office)</p></div>\n<p>There are other differences in work style. Every PM has his own way of staying on top of a constant flood of information and propagating a constant drumbeat of decisions. Paul Martin liked long meetings with a very large number of participants, an extension of the freewheeling budget preparation meetings that filled his winters earlier in his career, when he was Jean Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s minister of finance. Harper depended, increasingly over his decade in office, on written input, for which he had a voracious appetite and a tremendous capacity. He would want written memos, a page or four or seven pages long, on pressing issues. If one memo gave rise to questions, he\u2019d ask for more to respond. There\u2019d be 40 or 50 of these written pieces in a week, but Harper would rarely meet their authors or anyone from the departments charged with implementing his decisions.</p>\n<p>Trudeau relies more on the personal touch. In the early going, he has met every day with Janice Charette, the clerk of the Privy Council, who is the top-ranking public servant in Ottawa. Harper appointed her. Trudeau will replace her at some point, but he is in no hurry on that score. In the meantime the Prime Minister, Butts, and chief of staff Katie Telford meet Charette every day to discuss a range of issues. This puts a lot of pressure on Charette, who has her own stack of readings and briefings to digest before each meeting, but it allows the Prime Minister to consider the effects of initiatives across a range of portfolios.</p>\n<p>But the long-range focus is not merely a matter of Trudeau\u2019s personal style. It is baked into the design of his government. \u201cRight from the get-go there was a keen desire to make sure we focused on results and pacing of delivery,\u201d Peter Harder, a former deputy minister who ran Trudeau\u2019s transition team, said in an interview. The most visible sign of this is the most important cabinet committee. Under previous governments it would have been called \u201cpriorities and planning.\u201d Under Trudeau it\u2019s called \u201cagenda and results.\u201d Its goal is to relentlessly track progress against targets to make sure the government delivers on its agenda items. \u201cIt\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Harder said. \u201cOur cabinet committees [in previous governments] have always been focused on incoming events, not on stocks of results.\u201d The agenda and results membership list includes three ministers who are often named among Trudeau\u2019s closest personal confidants: House leader Dominic LeBlanc, Heritage Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly and Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/?dpsfa_article=now-for-the-hard-part-the-road-ahead-for-eight-cabinet-ministers\" target=\"_blank\">Profiles of the eight ministers with the toughest tasks</a></p></blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_797801\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-797801\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/TRUDEAU-carousel-1600.jpg\" alt=\"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at a press conference at Rideau Hall after being sworn in as Canada's 23rd Prime Minister in Ottawa, Ontario, November 4, 2015.

(GEOFF ROBINS/AFP/Getty Images)</p></div>\n<p>If there is a management guru who has guided the thinking of Trudeau\u2019s team in the early days, it is Sir Michael Barber, who helped implement education reforms during Tony Blair\u2019s first term as prime minister of the U.K. In Blair\u2019s second mandate he became Blair\u2019s chief adviser on delivery, charged with achieving similar results across government. Since then he has become a worldwide consultant helping governments achieve results. In 2004, when Dalton McGuinty was the new premier of Ontario and wanted to make a big difference in the province\u2019s schools, his chief of staff, the same Gerald Butts who would become a member of Trudeau\u2019s inner circle, spent four weeks following Barber around London. They have remained in touch ever since, and Barber is slated to meet Trudeau\u2019s cabinet early in the New Year.</p>\n<p>Trudeau, Butts and Telford are all reading Barber\u2019s latest book, <em>How to Run a Government So That Citizens Benefit and Taxpayers Don\u2019t Go Crazy.</em> Barber\u2019s thesis is that citizens\u2019 faith in government depends on governments being able to achieve their goals, and that constant attention and broadly available data are needed if those goals are to be reached. \u201cThe case made in this book has a moral purpose,\u201d he writes. \u201cMore people are more likely to lead more fulfilled lives if they live in countries with effective accountable governments, which can enforce basic individual rights and deliver effective public good.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is the kind of talk that turns the new Canadian Prime Minister\u2019s crank. A year ago, at a meeting of the Canada 2020 think tank in Ottawa,<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/macleans-live-gov-martin-omalley-in-conversation-with-justin-trudeau/\" target=\"_blank\"> Trudeau interviewed Martin O\u2019Malley,</a> the former Baltimore mayor and Maryland governor whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has so far <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/can-the-anonymous-martin-omalley-really-become-u-s-president/\" target=\"_blank\">failed to take off</a>, but who was able to deliver impressive results on education and health care. Like Barber, McGuinty (on his best days) and now Trudeau, O\u2019Malley\u2019s conviction is that success lies in \u201cselecting the right targets, publicly stating them and being willing to take the flak if you don\u2019t hit them,\u201d the Trudeau adviser said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt comes with its lumps, because people, given freedom, make mistakes,\u201d the adviser said. Nor has the Trudeau team figured out how to adapt Barber\u2019s model, which was very clearly led from Blair\u2019s office in the U.K., to a decentralized system of cabinet government in a loose federation like Canada. \u201cThat\u2019s something we have not yet cracked,\u201d the Trudeau adviser acknowledged.</p>\n<p>But Trudeau\u2019s commitment to a freer flow of information, and greater autonomy for cabinet ministers and all parliamentarians, \u201cis not some touchy-feely, love-people, hug-everybody thing that we did,\u201d the adviser insists. \u201cIt\u2019s what we think actually works. Over time, the reasonably good Harper ministers left because they just got sick of being managed that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to imagine all the ways events could knock this new Prime Minister off his game. It\u2019s almost certain that, to some extent, they will. The resiliency of this government will be tested as harshly as that of any of its predecessors. It is some consolation to them that they have a plan and a governing philosophy. They\u2019ll need both.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/inside-justin-trudeaus-turbo-zen-army/\">Inside Justin Trudeau\u2019s &#8216;turbo-Zen&#8217; army</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/inside-justin-trudeaus-turbo-zen-army/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>19</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Trudeau&#8217;s tweet from the Throne</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/trudeaus-tweet-from-the-throne/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/trudeaus-tweet-from-the-throne/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2015 23:36:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Throne Speech]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=805189</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Friday's speech weighed in at just 1,700 words.

Sean Kilpatrick/CP;</p></div>\n<p>I never tire of the optics of Speeches from the Throne. Not the content of each speech, or not only that, but simply\u00a0the geometry of the event. The feng shui of it. The Senators sit in their plushy red-lined digs and wait while servants run down the hall to fetch the rabble\u2014<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/shape-of-the-house/\" target=\"_blank\">the ordinary members of Parliament,</a> elected by the grimy unwashed.</p>\n<p>Trudging back down the hallway, MPs are permitted to stand at the door of the Upper Chamber but not to enter it. They listen, kids outside\u00a0a candy shop, while the Queen&#8217;s man in Ottawa reads out their orders for the next few years. And then the Governor General tops it all off\u00a0by handing these rowdy interlopers the bill. &#8220;Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament,&#8221; David Johnson said at the end of Friday&#8217;s Speech from the Throne.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/macleans-annotates-the-2015-speech-from-the-throne/\" target=\"_blank\">Maclean&#8217;s annotates the Throne Speech with expert analysis and context</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>They will, in point of fact, be asked to do rather more than that. Much has already been made of how short Friday&#8217;s speech was: 1,700 words, barely one-quarter as long as\u00a0the last speech Johnson delivered at Stephen Harper&#8217;s behest in 2013. At the time I called that speech &#8220;a breathtaking spout of free-associating bloviation.&#8221; This one is a haiku by comparison, shorter by 700 words than any Throne Speech I have ever heard in my approximately 147 years on Parliament Hill.</p>\n<p>But word length can be misleading.<span id=\"more-805189\"></span> Ottawa is dedicated to the principle that you can speak forever without saying anything. Similarly, or inversely, or something, you can fit an epoch into a really short Throne Speech. There&#8217;s a lot of marching in these marching orders. They began with the wholly unsurprising news that &#8220;The Government will, as an immediate priority, deliver a tax cut for the middle class.&#8221; But the rest followed at a racehorse tempo: &#8220;the new National Child Benefit;&#8221; &#8220;significant&#8221; investments in infrastructure; enhanced pensions and Employment Insurance; easier\u00a0access to post-secondary education; and a promise to &#8220;begin&#8221; work on a new health accord with provinces.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s just the first page of commitments from the new government. The second page promises electoral reform (&#8220;2015 will be the last federal election conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system&#8221;), Senate reform and House of Commons reform. After that came a price on carbon, a new &#8220;nation-to-nation&#8221; relationship with First Nations, 25,000 Syrian refugees by February, and legal pot.</p>\n<p>None of this was new. That&#8217;s by design. Trudeau&#8217;s public statements, his written record to date, and the anecdotal evidence I&#8217;ve gleaned from people who work with him all suggest he wants to go back to the voters in 2019 with a concrete record of achievement, and he wants that record to resemble his promises in 2015. Repetition and persistence, he hopes, will help his government build that record.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Watch:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jean-chretien-on-throne-speeches-honeymoons-and-hard-work/\" target=\"_blank\">Jean Chretien gives advice to Justin Trudeau</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Any single item\u00a0on Trudeau&#8217;s\u00a0list, or at least on my barely pared-down pr\u00e9cis above, could wreck his government if botched. If the health accord negotiations lead to federal-provincial strife, or legalized marijuana turns into a lurid string of reefer-madness headlines about stoner kids, or the Syrian target isn&#8217;t met or if it&#8217;s exceeded or whatever, that&#8217;s a high-profile failure and a time sink that will distract Trudeau&#8217;s attention from everything else he&#8217;s trying to get done.</p>\n<p>The tempo will be brisk. The refugee deadline is in February. I&#8217;m told to expect a second meeting of first ministers in March; a budget later that month; and a national plan for combating climate change for the beginning of April. By sometime later this spring, Trudeau will have filled\u00a0at least the 22 current Senate vacancies under his new system with its theoretically non-partisan advisory committee, and if they&#8217;re duds, everyone will know it.</p>\n<p>Even in a short speech, it was possible to note telling silences and lacunae. The <em>Globe</em> columnist Adam Radwanski pointed out, within minutes after the speech concluded, that it does not promise to implement &#8220;all&#8221; of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations. Tom Mulcair offered one-stop shopping for anyone wondering what else wasn&#8217;t in the speech: nothing on child care, nothing on at-the-door mail delivery. Many noticed there is no language about when the federal budget will be balanced again. Maybe never!</p>\n<p>But Trudeau has loaded up his plate for his first years as prime minister. His opponents argued, in effect, that he wanted this job to be someone, not to do something. He is eager to prove them wrong. Every opportunity to succeed is an opportunity to fail, so it should be a fun ride.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/three-things-to-watch-coming-out-of-the-throne-speech/\" target=\"_blank\">The Throne Speech is over.
