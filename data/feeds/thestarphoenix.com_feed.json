As a result, his heart stopped twice. His&nbsp;helicopter ride to the hospital took 21 minutes, and without it, he never would have survived, he said.</p>\n<p>He spent nine months in hospital recovering from the crash, including 11 weeks of rehabilitation, and now uses a wheelchair. Despite the challenges he faces today, Simpson said he is grateful for the second chance at life.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The positive to the whole thing is I&#8217;m still here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got kids that are loving me, thinking of me, and never look back at any of the complications.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s STARS lottery boasts prizes worth more than $4 million.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thestarphoenix.com&#038;blog=98658785&#038;post=137713&#038;subd=postmediathestarphoenix2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/man-thanks-stars-for-a-second-chance-at-life/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/saskatoon-sask-may-12-2016-may-12-2016-gord-waldner.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/saskatoon-sask-may-12-2016-may-12-2016-gord-waldner.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">051216-STARS19.jpg-Jason_Simpson-W.jpg</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fb8430b3770b11f8d356e81ebca025a6?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">brandonharder</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>DeLaet seven shots back of strong Day at Players Championship</title>\n\t\t<link>http://thestarphoenix.com/sports/golf/delaet-seven-shots-back-of-strong-day-at-players-championship</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://thestarphoenix.com/sports/golf/delaet-seven-shots-back-of-strong-day-at-players-championship#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:48:50 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[thestarphoenix]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Golf]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[golf]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Graham DeLaet]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jason Day]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[PGA Tour Events]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Players Championship]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Weyburn]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://thestarphoenix.com/?p=138068</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Jason Day tied the course&#160;record with a 63 in the first round of the Players Championship on Thursday at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.

Gardipy was there with some family members, visiting a man who was renting another room in the home, Crown prosecutor Bryce Pashovitz outlined in Saskatoon Court of Queen&#8217;s Bench.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_137906\" style=\"width: 258px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/craig-allen-mintuck-org-xmit-8ujmqvlkvsdfgrlrkv3e1.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-137906\" src=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/craig-allen-mintuck-org-xmit-8ujmqvlkvsdfgrlrkv3e1.jpeg?w=248&#038;h=300\" alt=\"Craig Allen Mintuck\" width=\"248\" height=\"300\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Craig Allen Mintuck</p></div>\n<p>Gardipy, 32, had been drinking that day with his sister and a cousin. During what seemed like a friendly visit in the kitchen, drinking some coolers, Mintuck suddenly stabbed Gardipy once in the abdomen in a motion that Gardipy&#8217;s sister didn&#8217;t even realize was violent, until she saw the blood on Gardipy&#8217;s white T-shirt.</p>\n<p>The eight-inch knife blade sliced into Gardipy&#8217;s aorta; he died of blood loss.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The burning question, one that will probably never be answered, is why?&#8221; Gardipy&#8217;s mother Sandra Neapetung said in court, addressing Mintuck.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What could my son have said to you to warrant such a senseless, brutal attack? &#8230; Why stab a stranger, an acquaintance, when there was no altercation? Life is so precious, and it can be gone in a split second and survivors of violence are forever changed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mintuck&#8217;s lawyer, George Combe, said he didn&#8217;t have an answer for the family.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All I can indicate to you is that my client, Mr. Mintuck, due to a state of drunkenness, has actually no memory or any consistent memory of what transpired,&#8221; Combe said in court. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s important to families to try and get some kind of closure, but I cannot provide the answer to you because there is no answer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mintuck was too nervous to address the family directly, Combe said, but wrote a letter that Combe read on his behalf.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The remorse that I feel knowing that I took someone special away from you is one of the most devastating feelings I have ever come to know,&#8221; Mintuck wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 36-year-old&#8217;s criminal record is so long and full of violent convictions his lawyer described it as &#8220;atrocious.&#8221; After his arrest in connection with Gardipy&#8217;s death, however, Mintuck disclosed for the first time his own history as a&nbsp;victim of&nbsp;abuse when he was a child and began getting counselling while on remand, Combe said.</p>\n<p>Mintuck turned to alcohol and drugs as a result of his experiences, and when he&#8217;s intoxicated, he becomes a different person, Combe told court.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is not an excuse for his behaviour.&nbsp;It&#8217;s just putting his life in context.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mintuck was charged with second-degree murder in Gardipy&#8217;s death, but following a preliminary hearing and discussions between lawyers, the Crown agreed to accept a plea to manslaughter. The Crown and defence jointly recommended a sentence of 15 years, with no eligibility for parole until Mintuck has served half of his sentence (offenders are generally eligible for parole after serving one-third of their sentence).</p>\n<p>Justice Gerald Allbright accepted the joint submission, noting it was &#8220;very much&#8221; at the high end of the range for manslaughter sentences in Saskatchewan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:hspray@postmedia.com\">hspray@postmedia.com</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thestarphoenix.com&#038;blog=98658785&#038;post=137752&#038;subd=postmediathestarphoenix2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thestarphoenix.com/news/crime/caswell-hill-stabbing-nets-man-15-year-sentence/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/albert-gardipy-died-of-a-single-stab-wound-to-his-abdomen-on.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/albert-gardipy-died-of-a-single-stab-wound-to-his-abdomen-on.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">051216-GARDIPY,_Albert.jpg-227570358-GARDIPY-_Albert-W.jpg</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4e837ac78906c9253a8d740d75e2f26f?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">hspraysp</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://postmediathestarphoenix2.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/craig-allen-mintuck-org-xmit-8ujmqvlkvsdfgrlrkv3e1.jpeg?w=248\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Craig Allen Mintuck</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Idylwyld Dr. overpass rehab starts Sunday</title>\n\t\t<link>http://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/idylwyld-dr-overpass-rehab-starts-sunday</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/idylwyld-dr-overpass-rehab-starts-sunday#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 23:52:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[thestarphoenix]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Local News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://thestarphoenix.com/?p=138027</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Major work on&#160;the Idylwyld Drive overpass at Ruth Street is set to start Sunday and while two-way traffic will be allowed, there will be restrictions in the area.

Speed and lane restrictions will be in place throughout the summer.</p>\n<p>Here are&nbsp;the city&#8217;s instructions for zipper merging:</p>\n<p>\u201cTo zipper merge correctly, as you see the &#8216;lane closed ahead&#8217; sign and traffic backing up, stay in your current lane up to the point of merge. Then take turns with other drivers to safely and smoothly ease into the remaining lane. Vehicles in the merging lane must signal, and drivers in the through lane must let one vehicle merge. This makes the traffic flow more quickly and efficiently for drivers in both lanes.\u201d</p>\n<p>The work will include stripping the surface asphalt, replacing the concrete deck and other miscellaneous repairs, according to the city.

for the province in the long term, according to the Crown corporation&#8217;s vice president of transmission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;(It is) something we&#8217;re looking at,&#8221; Tim Eckel said in an address to the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s annual general meeting, held Thursday morning in Saskatoon.</p>\n<p>Traditional nuclear power plants have a generating capacity of at least 600 megawatts (MW), which makes them unsuitable for Saskatchewan&#8217;s comparatively small electric grid, which currently has a maximum capacity of 4,400 MW, Eckel said.</p>\n<p>If a nuclear plant responsible for producing a sizable portion of the province&#8217;s power went&nbsp;off-line, the demand for electricity could suddenly outstrip supply, leading to problems, he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;(Traditional plants) are too large for our system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, SMRs with a generating capacity of between 300 and 400 MW \u2014 slightly smaller than SaskPower&#8217;s big coal- and natural gas-fired plants&nbsp;\u2014 would likely make sense in&nbsp;Saskatchewan, Eckel&nbsp;added.</p>\n<p>In a 2008 feasibility study, Bruce Power Limited Partnership, which operates a nuclear plant northwest of Toronto, said Saskatchewan will likely require at least 1,000 MW of nuclear generation capacity by 2020.</p>\n<p>A plant north of Saskatoon would likely cost between $8 and $10 billion, but&nbsp;contribute&nbsp;$240 million annually to the provincial economy&nbsp;and create&nbsp;1,000 permanent jobs over its 60-year lifespan, the study said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A 2014 study conducted at the University of Saskatchewan found that 50.3 per cent of Saskatchewan residents had a positive impression of nuclear power generation, while 22.9 per cent had a negative impression and 18.5 per cent reported no opinion on the subject.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Currently, about 25 per cent of the province&#8217;s&nbsp;power comes from clean sources. SaskPower said late last year that it plans to double that figure by 2030 using a mix of wind, solar and hydroelectric sources, while boosting its total capacity to about 7,000 MW.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To build a nuclear plant would take likely a decade \u2026 That alone would push it more than a decade away (and)&nbsp;the technology for SaskPower isn&#8217;t in place yet,&#8221; Eckel said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In its simplest form, a nuclear power plant works by using the nuclear reaction in its core to heat a closed loop of pressurized coolant. The coolant \u2014 usually water \u2014 produces steam, which drives a turbine that produces electricity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Several companies in the United States, China and other countries are developing SMRs. Some use molten metal or salt as coolant, but most are scaled-down versions of conventional pressurized water&nbsp;plants.</p>\n<p>While multiple countries have operating small nuclear reactors, the most advanced modular designs are under development in China with&nbsp;startup expected in 2017, according to the World Nuclear Association.&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81971\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2015/12/saskatoon-sask-july-28-2015-executive-director-of-the-fed.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-81971\" src=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2015/12/saskatoon-sask-july-28-2015-executive-director-of-the-fed.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"Neil Alexander is executive director of the Sylvia Fedoruk Centre for Nuclear Innovation. \" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sylvia Fedoruk Canadian Centre for Nuclear Innovation executive director Neil Alexander</p></div>\n<p>Although SMRs&nbsp;have a lengthy development cycle, they also have considerable advantages over large plants used to power dense population centres, according to the executive director of the Sylvia Fedoruk Canadian Centre for Nuclear Innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The key thing about these new units is they will have this high degree of modularity, which allows them to better fit from that economics (point of view),&#8221; Neil Alexander said.</p>\n<p>Whereas most major nuclear plants are one-offs, factory-built reactors benefit from economies of scale and repetition,&nbsp;leading to reduced costs, Alexander said.

Alexander said he thinks&nbsp;it&#8217;s unlikely the province will continue building new fossil fuel plants, so&nbsp;&#8220;they need to find alternatives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;One opportunity for these small modular reactors is the 300 MW plant that would replace our existing coal-fired plants and go onto the grid as a relatively cheap replacement to coal that is non-greenhouse-gas emitting,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The other is that the much smaller plants could be pretty much off-grid applications, serving a particular site or a community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nuclear power comes with challenges including decommissioning, the management of spent fuel and the comparatively high capital costs, as well as the &#8220;remote risk&#8221; of a major accident, according to Peter Prebble, the Saskatchewan Environmental Society&#8217;s environmental policy director.</p>\n<p>While nuclear power is cleaner than the coal- and gas-fired plants currently operating in Saskatchewan, it is a non-renewable resource and therefore&nbsp;incompatible with the &#8220;renewable future&#8221; being built around the world, Prebble said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something that needs to be re-evaluated every decade, but we think right now that we&#8217;ve got much better alternatives \u2026 and that is large-scale investment not just in wind, but in all the renewables.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:amacpherson@postmedia.com\">amacpherson@postmedia.com</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/macphersona\">twitter.com/macphersona</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thestarphoenix.com&#038;blog=98658785&#038;post=137581&#038;subd=postmediathestarphoenix2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thestarphoenix.com/business/local-business/small-reactors-could-be-game-changer-for-saskatchewan-saskpower-vp/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/saskatoon-sask-may-12-2016-0513-business-saskpower-ti.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/saskatoon-sask-may-12-2016-0513-business-saskpower-ti.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">051216-tim_eckel.jpg-227562168-tim_eckel-W.jpg</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b41feb097ffb44ceb06d16099eaf758e?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">amacphersonsp</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://postmediathestarphoenix2.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/saskatoon-sask-july-28-2015-executive-director-of-the-fed.jpeg?w=300\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Neil Alexander is executive director of the Sylvia Fedoruk Centre for Nuclear Innovation. </media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
