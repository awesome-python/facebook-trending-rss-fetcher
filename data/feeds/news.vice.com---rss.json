The smoggiest were typically in the eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asia, where air pollution in two-thirds of the cities measured saw increases in soot and small particle concentrations of 5 percent or more. The highest were dozens of times worse than the standards the UN agency recommends. </p><p>The WHO blames air pollution for more than 3 million premature deaths every year from ailments like lung and heart diseases. And as is commonly seen with other environmental issues, richer countries fared better than poorer ones. </p><p>\"In general, developed countries have addressed air pollution in a way that is more consistent, and they have experienced improvement in air quality,\" said Dr. Agnes Soares, the regional advisor for environmental epidemiology at the Pan-American Health Organization, the WHO's regional affiliate for the Americas. \"Although you still find many areas where this has not happened.\"</p><p>The study found 98 percent of the larger cities in low- or middle-income countries failed to meet WHO guidelines. But even in higher-income nations, 56 percent flunked. And in places like Mexico City, which has been working to clean up its notoriously chunky air, the results haven't been enough to hit the WHO's targets, Soares said. </p><p>The biggest problems tend to be in countries that still rely on stoves for cooking and lack reliable electric power, Soares said. </p><p>\"In Haiti, for example, more than 90 percent of the population uses either charcoal or wood to cook,\" she said. \"This is the highest contributor, but also the use of diesel for electricity is a big contributor.\" And in developing countries, meanwhile, increasing traffic and power plants that run on coal tend to run up pollution figures.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/heres-how-many-people-die-each-day-in-china-because-of-its-filthy-air\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related</strong>: Here's How Many People Die Each Day in China Because of Its Filthy Air</a><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/heres-how-many-people-die-each-day-in-china-because-of-its-filthy-air\"></a><br></p><p>\"Development per se is not bad, and industrialization can be good,\" she said. \"But if we want to improve the health of the people, we have to think about how to control air pollution as well.\" </p><p>The WHO included the two most common pollutant readings  fine particulates, smaller than 2.5 micrometers, and coarser particles up to 10 micrometers, or about a tenth the width of a typical human hair. The agency recommends concentrations of those pollutants be no higher than 20 micrograms per cubic meter of air for PM10 and no more than 10 for PM2.5. </p><p>\"PM2.5 in general is more toxic than PM10, but PM10 is not benign and can also cause problems,\" said Dr. David Peden, director of the University of North Carolina's Center for Environmental Medicine. </p><p>But cutting those pollutants can result in swift results, Peden said. When Atlanta restricted traffic around large parts of town for the 1996 summer Olympics, doctors recorded a decrease in asthma-related hospital emissions. The Chinese capital Beijing saw similar results when it tried to clear the air ahead of the 2008 games, he said. </p><p>\"They basically shut down industries for a couple of weeks, and people could not drive their car but every other day,\" Peden said. \"It was quite draconian in some ways for the individual. But that resulted in notably cleaner air during the Beijing Olympics, and as those restrictions were eased, the pollution returned.\" </p><p>Peden said there are less dramatic ways to reduce pollution  \"But I think the ultimate solution for all this will largely be engineering.\"</p><p> \"It will be developing and harnessing fuel sources that do not involve burning carbon to be able to generate electricity, heat water, and give us energy to do what we need to do on a daily basis,\" he said. \"That's where ultimately a lot of the solution needs to happen. But in the meantime, being more efficient, and maybe burning less during certain times of the year when the air gets trapped, might be useful interventions.\"</p><p>And Soares said national leaders should think of pollution as a health problem, one that can drain budgets swiftly. </p><p>\"This not only increases mortality  you have a decrease in life expectancy  but also it increases the number of people with disabilities, living many years under treatment,\" she said. \"That is not only a heavy burden for the person, for the families, but also for the health system.\" </p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/scientists-question-mexico-citys-drastic-plan-fight-pollution-will-make-difference\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related</strong>: Scientists Question If Mexico City's Drastic Plan to Fight Pollution Will Make a Difference</a><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/scientists-question-mexico-citys-drastic-plan-fight-pollution-will-make-difference\"></a><br></p><p>Two cities split the dubious honor of having the worst air in the world: Zabol, in southeastern Iran, had the highest PM2.5 concentrations, at an average of 170 micrograms per liter. Onitsha, in southern Nigeria, edged out Zabol and the Pakistani city of Peshawar with a PM10 count of 594. </p><p>Beijing, which has become synonymous with smog since the country's rapid industrialization, ranked 59th-worst with a PM2.5 count of 85. Its PM 10 count of 108 was good for 156th place. </p><p>The cleanest air in the survey was in Sinclair, Wyoming, a town of about 420 people in the desert highlands between Cheyenne and Salt Lake City. Sinclair scored an average PM2.5 count of 2 and a PM10 count of 3. </p><p><em>Follow Matt Smith on Twitter: </em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattsmithatl\" target=\"_blank\">@mattsmithatl</a></em><br></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/the-air-in-nearly-every-big-city-in-the-developing-world-is-unhealthy-to-breathe\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/the-air-in-nearly-every-big-city-in-the-developing-world-is-unhealthy-to-breathe#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[The Olympics Won't Be Cancelled Over Zika, So Keep It In Your Pants And Use Bug Spray]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/the-olympics-wont-be-cancelled-over-zika-so-use-bug-spray-and-keep-it-in-your-pants</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Tamara Khandaker for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:35:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite calls from one Canadian professor, the Rio Olympics will go ahead as planned \u2014 so the World Health Organizations has a few tips on how to avoid further spread of the Zika virus.\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Zika]]></category><category><![CDATA[Amir Attaran]]></category><category><![CDATA[Brazil]]></category><category><![CDATA[Olympics]]></category><category><![CDATA[International Olympic Committee]]></category><category><![CDATA[South America]]></category><category><![CDATA[Rio De Janeiro]]></category><category><![CDATA[World Health Organization]]></category><category><![CDATA[Zika Virus]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/05/12/rio-olympics-will-go-ahead-even-as-experts-warn-of-zika-1463088828.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" length=\"3000\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>The Rio Olympics will forge ahead, despite a Canadian professor's calls for the Games be moved or postponed in light of the Zika virus.</p><p>The confirmation follows comments from University of Ottawa professor Amir Attaran in the Harvard Public Health Review that allowing the games to continue in Brazil as scheduled could lead to a \"a full-blown global health disaster.\"</p><p>But the International Olympic Committee (IOC) sees no need to delay the games, based on advice from the World Health Organization (WHO). Officials say they're confident the situation will get better in the next three months, but plan to watch the situation in Rio, where the virus is thriving, \"very closely.\" </p><p>\"The clear statements from WHO that there should be no restrictions on travel and trade means there is no justification for cancelling, delaying, postponing or moving the Rio games,'' IOC medical director Richard Budgett told the Associated Press on Thursday. </p><p>On Thursday, the WHO  which advises the government of Brazil and the IOC  encouraged visitors and athletes to use insect repellant and wear clothing that covers as much of the body as possible, and to practice safe sex or abstain while in Rio. </p><p class=\"read-more\"><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/rio-has-three-times-more-zika-cases-than-any-other-city-in-brazil\" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=\"1\">Rio Has Three Times More Zika Cases Than Any Other State in Brazil</a></strong><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/rio-has-three-times-more-zika-cases-than-any-other-city-in-brazil\" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=\"1\"></a></p><p>In addition, the WHO advised visitors to choose accommodation with air conditioning so mosquitoes can't get in through open windows, and to avoid visits to \"impoverished and overcrowded areas in cities and towns with no piped water and poor sanitation (ideal breeding grounds of mosquitoes) where the risk of being bitten is higher.\"</p><p>The situation in Rio is more dire than scientists had predicted, Attaran argues in his paper. </p><p>\"Which leads to a bitter truth: the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games must be postponed, moved, or both, as a precautionary concession,\" he writes.</p><p>First, he argues, Rio de Janeiro has been hit harder than the rest of Brazil, much to the surprise of the IOC, which in January declared the city a \"safe environment.\" Data now shows that there are more cases in Rio de Janeiro now than any other state in Brazil, and the incidence rate there is the fourth-worst in the country. </p><p>\"Or in other words: according to the Brazil's official data, Rio is not on the fringes of the outbreak, but inside its heart,\" Attaran wrote. </p><blockquote>\"How socially responsible or ethical is it to spread disease?\"</blockquote><p>In Thursday's statement, the WHO reassured readers that because the games are taking place in the Brazilian wintertime, \"there are fewer active mosquitoes and the risk of being bitten is lower.\"</p><p>But Attaran dismissed the notion preemptively, arguing that there's no way to know if Zika will slow down in the winter like most mosquito-borne viruses, firstly because Rio hasn't experienced a winter with the virus yet, and second, because its spread could be similar to dengue, which slows down, but doesn't diappear in the winter. Further, he points out, Rio is in the midst of a \"surprising and unexplained disease surge,\" with 6 times more cases of dengue in the first quarter of 2016 than last year. </p><p>The viral strain now in Brazil, he says, is \"clearly new, different, and vastly more dangerous,\" with what appears to be a \"truly causal\" relationship to microcephaly  in Brazil, Attaran writes, the effects of microcephaly have been \"suggestive of 'fetal brain disruption sequence' in which the developing brain and skull collapse while other anatomical features like the scalp skin keep growing.\"</p><p>Attaran believes 500,000 foreign tourists flooding into Rio for the Games will only help to speed up the spread of the virus. And while it's debatable how much worse the pandemic will be made by mass migration, \"none can possibly argue that it will slow it down or make things better,\" he writes. </p><p>And if the Games do extend the virus's reach, Attaran argues, scientists and health professionals have less time to work on developing and testing solutions, like a vaccine or an antiviral drug. </p><p class=\"read-more\"><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/sexually-transmitted-case-of-zika-reported-in-texas\" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=\"1\">'Sexually Transmitted' Case of Zika Reported in Texas</a></strong><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/sexually-transmitted-case-of-zika-reported-in-texas\" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=\"1\"></a></p><p>Attaran concludes, saying that letting the Games go on in the current context violates what the Olympics stand for. </p><p>\"How socially responsible or ethical is it to spread disease?\"</p><p>Those wealthy enough to travel to Rio for the games choose to take on the risks, he writes, but those around them when they return home have to bear them too. </p><p>\"This equity problem takes on added meaning in poorer, weaker countries like Nigeria, India or Indonesia, which haven't got the resources to fight Zika that Brazil does  and which anyway are proving insufficient.\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>Follow Tamara Khandaker on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/anima_tk\" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=\"1\">@anima_tk</a></em><br></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/the-olympics-wont-be-cancelled-over-zika-so-use-bug-spray-and-keep-it-in-your-pants\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/the-olympics-wont-be-cancelled-over-zika-so-use-bug-spray-and-keep-it-in-your-pants#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[Americans Accused Of Trying To Overthrow Gambia's President Sentenced In Minnesota Court ]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/americans-accused-of-trying-to-overthrow-gambias-president-sentenced-in-minnesota-court</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kayla Ruble for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:25:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA judge handed down sentences against four men for violating the Neutrality Act, a little-used law that prevents US citizens from acting against a friendly nation.\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Americas]]></category><category><![CDATA[West Africa]]></category><category><![CDATA[Gambia]]></category><category><![CDATA[Banjul]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Drugs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Minnesota]]></category><category><![CDATA[Papa Faal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cherno Njie]]></category><category><![CDATA[Banka Manneh]]></category><category><![CDATA[Coup Plotters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Freedom Fighters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Yahya Jammeh]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fbi]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/05/12/americans-accused-of-trying-to-overthrow-gambias-president-sentenced-in-minnesota-court-1463088357.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" length=\"2000\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>Four American citizens accused of helping to plan a failed coup in the Gambia against President Yahya Jammeh more than a year ago have been sentenced by a Minnesota judge, who has carried out the first prosecution using the country's Neutrality Act in 35 years.</p><p>The individuals include Texas businessman Cherno Njie, who allegedly funded the operation; Minnesota resident Papa Faal; and 41-year-old Alagie Barrow. All three individuals were charged last January with conspiring to violate the Neutrality Act, a law enacted in 1974 that prevents US citizens from taking action against a friendly nation. They were also charged with <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/minneapolis/press-releases/2015/two-defendants-charged-for-their-roles-in-an-attempted-coup-in-the-gambia\">conspiring</a> to possess firearms to pursue a violent crime.</p><p>Njie was sentenced to one year and one day, three years probation and a $10,000 fine. Faal was sentenced to time served over the last year. Barrow received six months in prison and three years probation. All had faced maximum penalties of up to 20 years in prison. </p><p>The fourth defendant, US-based Gambian activist Banka Manneh, was indicted after a separate investigation accused him of assisting with the coup plot. He was accused of having \"participated in conference calls and exchanged planning documents with the other members of the conspiracy,\" and having \"purchased two pistols and one rifle to equip co-conspirators participating in the coup.\" He was also charged with violating the Neutrality Act. The last time a case was prosecuted under the Neutrality Act was in 1981 against two individuals <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/21/us/2-guilty-in-new-orleans-for-plot-on-dominica-invasion.html\" target=\"_blank\">accused</a> of a coup attempt in the Caribbean island nation of Dominica.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/gambia-raises-presidential-election-fees-by-nearly-1000-percent\"><strong>Related: </strong>Gambia Raises Presidential Election Fees By Nearly 1,000 Percent</a></p><p>The coup saga in the Gambia unfolded during the early hours of December 30, 2014 when a small group of armed men snuck through the borders of the small West African nation and made their way to the capital city Banjul while Jammeh was out of the country.  As they attempted to storm the state house they were met with heavy gunfire from security forces, squashing the coup, and killing at least four assailants. </p><p>Many of the men were Gambians who had fled abroad living in countries like the US, UK, and Germany. The assailants, referred to by the Gambian diaspora and dissident factions as \"freedom fighters,\" included former Gambian military officials and even a US soldier. Njaga Jagne, killed in the firefight, was a Kentucky national Guard member, while Lamin Sanneh, was trained at the UK's Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and previously served as commander of Gambia's presidential guard. </p><p>Faal and Barrow managed to survive and flee across the border into Senegal  which surrounds the coastal country to the north, south, and east. After his escape, Faal went directly to the US embassy in Dakar where he gave an interview before making his way back to the US, officials said. He was later interviewed again by the FBI at the airport in Washington DC. He was charged in January.</p><p>Barrow has been accused of hiding out with Njie at an unidentified location in the Gambia while the operation against the statehouse took place. The investigation said they planned to enter the statehouse once the mission was complete and place Njie in power. The pair also managed to escape and make it back to the US before being charged and indicted. </p><p>After news of the coup broke, the US State Department condemned what they called an attempt to overthrow the government through \"extra-constitutional means,\" and called on all sides to \"refrain from further violence.\"</p><p>Manneh, a long-time activist in the Gambian diaspora, was the last to be charged after the FBI investigation alleged he had participated and assisted in planning the coup, although he did not travel to the Gambia to participate. The investigation detailed accusations that Manneh purchased weapons and participated in outlining a future leadership structure.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/gambian-president-says-he-will-slit-gay-mens-throats-in-public-speech\"><strong>Related: </strong>Gambian President Says He Will Slit Gay Men's Throats in Public Speech</a></p><p>Much of his work focused on reaching out to average Gambians and helping them get their stories out of the country. Njie and Faal, on the other hand, were less vocal in their feelings about Jammeh and his regime, with many diaspora members initially surprised by their involvement as the news emerged. In video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo8rQktXthw\">recordings</a> on YouTube, Manneh spoke about issues facing the Gambia. Speaking just months before the coup attempt, he discussed why he had gotten involved in the \"struggle to liberate\" the Gambia from what he referred to as Yaya Jammeh's dictatorship.</p><p>\"The reason I am in this struggle is one simple fact, I happen to have my own dreams... the dreams that I have are actually inspired by things I have seen and witnessed in my life, my own experiences.\"</p><p>Manneh expresses the excitement he had initially when Jammeh rose to power through a coup in 1994, ousting President Dawda Jawara who had been in power for 24 years. As killings and human rights violations escalated under Jammeh's regime, Manneh fled to the US. The activist has said this has shaped his dream to fight for a free Gambia. </p><p>\"What I see in the US, what I felt in the US, the opportunities I have seen here, the human rights and the democracy and the rule of law is what I want in the Gambia, and even better,\" he said. \"The Gambia can be like that, we can be a developed nation.... People who have their dignity intact.\"</p><p>More than a year after the attempted coup, an opposition movement has developed in the Gambia, starting with protests in April calling for electoral reforms ahead of the December polls that will see Jammeh seek to extend his 22-year rule. </p><p>The 49-year-old dictator is known for silencing dissenters and shoving them in prisons with deplorable conditions. The leader previously also claimed he could cure both AIDS and Ebola, while maintaining that he would rule the Gambia for one billion years  if God allowed it. Recently, Gambia <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/05/19/uk-westafrica-democracy-limits-idUKKBN0O42EU20150519\" target=\"_blank\">helped prevent</a> a proposal from moving forward during a meeting of the Economic Community of West African States that would have set term limits in the region. </p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/gambian-president-returns-home-amid-fears-of-brutal-backlash-after-foiled-coup\"><strong>Related: </strong>Gambian President Returns Home Amid Fears of Brutal Backlash After Foiled Coup</a><br></p><p>Jammeh has also become known for anti-LGBT rhetoric, saying in a speech last year that he would slit gay men's throats. The Gambia is one of 38 countries across Africa where homosexuality is illegal, with Jammeh signing off on a law last year that qualified gay acts as crimes of \"aggravated homosexuality\" and punishable by life in prison.</p><p>Concerns about free and fair elections, and the recent increase in the cost of running for office, have sparked calls for electoral reforms and the latest protest movement. Tensions escalated in Banjul at the end of April when security forces arrested dozens of people during a march, including several officials from the United Democratic Party. Days later news emerged that youth leader Solo Sandeng died in custody. Critics have continued to gather and protest outside the courthouse as a group of 20 opposition members, including UDP leader Ousainou Darboe.</p><p>The international community has condemned the Gambian government's response to the protests.

He lives in Daraya, a rebel-controlled suburb of Damascus that's besieged by the Syrian regime. His wife and child live just a few kilometers to the west, in the neighboring rebel suburb of Moadamiya. The Syrian army cut the road between the two enclaves in January shortly before his daughter was born.</p><p>On Thursday, Omar eagerly awaited the arrival of an international aid convoy that was scheduled to bring medicine and baby formula into Daraya. The Syrian government agreed to the delivery, and it was organized by the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.</p><p>It would have been the first convoy to reach Daraya since it was first besieged in 2012  but the trucks didn't make it to the town.</p><p>According to the ICRC, it was turned away at the last checkpoint outside of Daraya. Just minutes after the convoy was sent back, the Local Council of Daraya  a committee that operates as the local government  reported that the Syrian army had shelled a group of civilians who'd gathered to receive the aid. A father and son were killed and five other civilians were injured, the council said. </p><p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group, said Syrian troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad's regime had fired into the town.</p><p>After the shelling, Omar rushed to a nearby field hospital where the wounded were being treated. </p><p>\"The people are now filled with frustration and anger,\" he told VICE News via messaging app. \"To be honest, at this point we no longer trust the international community or the UN.\"</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/rebel-advance-in-aleppo-countryside-sparks-fierce-fighting-airstrikes\"><strong>Related:</strong> Rebel Advance in Aleppo Countryside Sparks Fierce Fighting, Airstrikes</a></p><p>Though it's just a 20-minute drive from the center of Damascus, Daraya is one of the most isolated places in Syria: it's been under siege for over four years, and it's one of the few areas where no aid convoys have ever been permitted to enter. According to residents interviewed by VICE News, people survive on meager meals of lentil and rice soup that are often fortified with weeds or grass. The water supply was cut off two years ago.</p><p>\"Daraya is probably the place in Syria today where the greatest unmet needs caused by besiegement exist,\" UN senior advisor Jan Egeland told reporters on Thursday. </p><p>The aborted convoy didn't carry food beyond milk for infants, and aid workers characterized it as a confidence-building measure that would hopefully lead to future deliveries. </p><p>\"The assessment mission is certainly a first step,\" Egeland said just hours before it failed. </p><p>Members of a crowd of people that had gathered in Daraya to receive the convoy on Thursday evening held up signs saying, \"I can't eat medicine,\" and, \"Medicine on an empty stomach doesn't help me.\"</p><p>The UN later reported that regime soldiers at the last checkpoint outside of Daraya began removing medical and nutritional items for children  everything except vaccines  from the convoy. Speaking to reporters in New York, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that Staffan de Mistura, the UN's special envoy for Syria, and Jacob el-Hillo, its humanitarian coordinator for the country, \"made the decision not to go through because these key items were taken out\" despite the fact that the regime had already authorized their delivery.</p><p>But less than an hour after the UN accused the Syrian regime of pilfering supplies, the UN and ICRC released a joint statement with no reference to the removal of items in the Daraya mission. The convoy was simply \"refused entry,\" the statement said. </p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/dozens-dead-after-airstrike-hits-a-syrian-camp-for-civilians-whove-fled-the-war\"><strong>Related:</strong> Dozens Dead as Airstrike Hits Syrian Camp for Civilians Who've Fled the War</a></p><p>Pawel Krzysiek, an ICRC spokesperson who was traveling with the convoy, also stressed that the convoy didn't turn back because certain items were removed. The convoy had waited for more than seven hours at the regime checkpoint outside of Daraya before being turned away, he said, noting that he didn't think the soldiers at the checkpoint had any intention of permitting the convoy into the besieged area.</p><p>This isn't the first time the UN has charged the Syrian authorities with taking supplies from aid convoys. In a March 30 briefing to the Security Council, UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien said that more than 80,000 medical treatments, including items to treat child malnutrition and medicine for bleeding after childbirth, had been removed from such convoys in just the first three months of 2016.</p><p>In a statement released on Thursday evening, el-Hillo, the humanitarian coordinator, described the situation in Daraya as dire. </p><p>\"We were hoping that today's delivery of life saving assistance would have been a first step and lead to more aid being allowed in,\" he said. \"We know the situation there is desperate.\"</p><p>Daraya has endured round after round of atrocities. Shortly before the siege was imposed in November 2012, nearly 500 residents were killed in just two and a half days in one of the most bloody massacres of the Syrian civil war. For most of the last four years, Daraya has been pounded from the air  locals say Assad's forces dropped more than 6,800 barrel bombs between January 2014 and February 2016, when a cessation of hostilities agreement was reached between the regime and some rebels groups. Over the course of the war, what was once a city of 80,000 people has dwindled to a ghost town of 8,000.</p><p>Muhammad Shihadeh, an English teacher who works with the Local Council, said that the failure of Thursday's aid convoy fits within the regime's pattern of behavior. </p><p>\"I believe its revenge,\" he told VICE News via-messaging app. \"The regime is trying to take revenge against the people by starving it, even as they allow aid to other places within Syria.\"</p><p>Krzysiek hopes the Red Cross will be able to return to Daraya soon and deliver much-needed supplies to the civilians stranded there. </p><p>\"We are ready to come back,\" he said. \"We wanted to get to them... We will not forget them, and we will keep trying no matter how difficult it is.\"</p><p><em>Samuel Oakford contributed to this report</em><span class=\"apple-converted-space\"><i>.</i></span></p><p><em>Follow Avi Asher-Schapiro on Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/AASchapiro\"><em>@AASchapiro</em></a></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/syrian-regime-blocks-aid-convoy-and-shells-civilians-who-gathered-to-receive-it\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/syrian-regime-blocks-aid-convoy-and-shells-civilians-who-gathered-to-receive-it#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[US Planning Month Of Raids To Deport Hundreds Of Central American Moms And Kids]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/us-planning-month-of-raids-to-deport-hundreds-of-central-american-moms-and-kids</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Reuters News Agency]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA month-long deportation sweep targeting immigrant families would be the largest operation this year, following a similar drive that sparked outcry in January.\r\n\r\nICE has reportedly told its field offices nationwide to launch a 30-day \"surge\" of arrests focused on mothers and children who have already been told to leave the US.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jeh Johnson]]></category><category><![CDATA[Department Of Homeland Security]]></category><category><![CDATA[Immigration And Customs Enforcement]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ice]]></category><category><![CDATA[Barack Obama]]></category><category><![CDATA[Obama Administration]]></category><category><![CDATA[Deportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Immigration]]></category><category><![CDATA[Border Patrol]]></category><category><![CDATA[Honduras]]></category><category><![CDATA[Guatemala]]></category><category><![CDATA[El Salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nicaragua]]></category><category><![CDATA[Central America]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[United States]]></category><category><![CDATA[Americas]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/05/12/untitled-article-1463080531.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" length=\"2000\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>US immigration officials are planning a month-long series of raids in May and June to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children found to have entered the country illegally, according to sources and an internal document seen by Reuters.</p><p>The operation would likely be the largest deportation sweep targeting immigrant families by the administration of President Barack Obama this year after a similar drive over two days in January that focused on Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina.</p><p>Those raids, which resulted in the detention of 121 people, mostly women and children, sparked an outcry from immigration advocates and criticism from some Democrats, including the party's presidential election frontrunner Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has now told field offices nationwide to launch a 30-day \"surge\" of arrests focused on mothers and children who have already been told to leave the United States, the document seen by Reuters said.

In some ways they are worse,\" Gray wrote in his decision. \"The inmate is holed up with another inmate not of his choosing. The actual periods of confinement for 24 hours a day are entirely arbitrary, and unpredictable...\"</p><p>When the prison is on lockdown, inmates can be held in their cells all day. If they're let out at all during that time, it's might be only to take a shower or make a phone call. Counsel for the government defended its lockdown procedures as necessary to ensure the safety of the facility, but the deputy Superintendent of the facility did not deny in court that the frequent lockdowns could have negative effects on prisoners.</p><blockquote>'Some inmates will even pull the water sprinklers in their cells just to get a shower.'</blockquote><p>Neither Ogiamien nor Nguyen have been convicted of a crime, though they are treated like any other convicted felon at Maplehurst, a men's prison that can house from 1,000 to 1,100 prisoners at a time. Ogiamien was detained by the Canada Border Services Agency in 2013 for immigration-related concerns, and Nguyen has been there for more than a year awaiting trial for firearms charges.</p><p>According to statistics filed by the government in court, the units Ogiamien and Nguyen were held in were under lockdown 46 percent of the time in 2014, and in 2015 that went up to 55 percent. So far this year, from January to March, the prison has been on lockdown 40 percent of the time.</p><p>Ogiamien wrote to the court in an affidavit that lockdowns can lead to fighting among inmates, and that inmates will gang up or resort to using weapons to get access to a shower or telephone.</p><p>The judge summarized Ogiamien's testimony that some inmates will even \"pull the water sprinklers in their cells just to get a shower.\"</p><p>Barbara Jackman, a Toronto immigration lawyer who oversaw the inmates' case, told VICE News the government will likely appeal the decision, but praised it as a sign that correctional services might have to be improved in the future.

Comey suggested that officers are deterred from more active policing because they fear being filmed and ending up online.</p><p> \"What I'm talking about is sort of the viral video effect,\" he remarked. \"Changes in the way police may be acting and in the way communities may be acting in terms of how much information they share with police could well be at the heart of this or could well be an important factor in this.\"</p><p>Comey raised this issue last fall, dubbing it the \"Ferguson effect\" in reference to the Missouri city where a white officer shot an unarmed black teen named Michael Brown, sparking nationwide protests as well as spurring the Black Lives Matter movement and calls for police accountability. Part of the effort to increase transparency and accountability has been the proliferation of online videos documenting incidences of apparent police brutality and excessive use of force.</p><p>Comey told a group of students at the University of Chicago Law School in October that officers are \"under siege\" from viral videos. He said that a spike in murders across the country has come after homicides fell to historic lows in 2014. He added that there are other possible reasons for the jump in crime, but the one that seems to fit best is a change in police behavior.</p><p>\"I actually feel the lines continuing to arch away, and maybe accelerating, incident by incident, video by video, hashtag by hashtag, and that's a terrible place to be,\" he said. \"The question is, are these kinds of things changing police behavior around the country? The honest answer is I don't know for sure whether that's the case... but I do have a strong sense.\"</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/the-fbi-director-says-cops-are-under-siege-from-viral-videos\"><b>Related:</b> The FBI Director Says Cops Are 'Under Siege' From Viral Videos</a></p><p>Comey's remarks in October drew criticism from law enforcement leaders across the country  chiefs in Seattle and Oakland told reporters that their officers did not feel boxed in by the prospect of cellphone footage. But former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly commended Comey for \"telling it like it is.\"</p><p>\"I mean, if you talk to police officers in other jurisdictions, not only in New York where I am, they will tell you that. They are backing off,\" Kelly said.</p><p>The most recent statistics on rising crime rates have not been publicly released. Comey received the briefing on Wednesday and made his most recent comments shortly after. The FBI director once again said he didn't know \"for sure\" why \"a whole lot more people are dying this year than last year, and last year than the year before.\" But he claimed that the viral video effect \"could well be an important factor in this.\"</p><p>He repudiated his previous use of the term \"Ferguson effect\" on Wednesday, but said that \"lots and lots of police officers\" had told him that they felt forced to back off on policing tactics and confrontations with suspects because of the videos.</p><p>In March, former White House National Drug Policy spokesperson Robert Weiner and senior policy analyst Ben Lasky argue argued<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"><i> </i></span>in an <a href=\"http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/1/robert-weiner-ben-lasky-the-predictable-effects-of/\">article</a> for the <i>Washington Times</i> that the uptick in violent crimes in major cities throughout the US is related to new drug legalization laws a lack of background checks on firearm purchases rather than the \"Ferguson effect.\"</p><p>Weiner and Lasky referred to the Ferguson effect argument and the idea that concerns about cellphone cameras were increasing violent crime as \"convenient rationalizations by law enforcement.\"</p><p><em>Follow VICE News on Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/vicenews\"><em>@vicenews</em></a></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/fbi-director-james-comey-links-viral-video-effect-to-spike-in-crime-rates\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/fbi-director-james-comey-links-viral-video-effect-to-spike-in-crime-rates#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[World Leaders Gather In London For Anti-Corruption Summit \u2014 But There's An 'Elephant In The Room']]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/world-leaders-gather-in-london-for-anti-corruption-summit-but-theres-an-elephant-in-the-room</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Sally  Hayden for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:25:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVICE News attended British Prime Minister David Cameron's anti-corruption summit in London, which saw world leaders come together to discuss transparency and stolen assets.\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Uk]]></category><category><![CDATA[United Kingdom]]></category><category><![CDATA[England]]></category><category><![CDATA[London]]></category><category><![CDATA[David Cameron]]></category><category><![CDATA[John Kerry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ashraf Ghani]]></category><category><![CDATA[Muhammadu Buhari]]></category><category><![CDATA[Afghanistan]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nigeria]]></category><category><![CDATA[Christine Lagarde]]></category><category><![CDATA[International Monetary Fund]]></category><category><![CDATA[Corruption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Anti-corruption Summit]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/05/12/sally-working-on-anti-corruption-summit-1463060424.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" length=\"1280\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>\"Welcome to our tax haven,\" a suited man wearing a bowler hat and proffering a wad of fake 100 pound bills said cheerily to a tourist in central London. \"I'm not from here,\" the German woman responded with confusion. \"I don't know anything about your tax haven.\"</p><p>The stunt the man was taking part in saw advocacy groups create a beach complete with palm trees and deck chairs in Trafalgar Square.

For the first time since the 1974-1979 presidential term, the list included not a single woman. President Lula da Silva, by contrast, had 11 female ministers, while Rousseff had 15.</p><p>The announcement was met with disbelief by many Brazilians who fear the interim government led by Temer will not represent the interests of women or other minority groups.</p><p>\" has a symbolic dimension, but it also says a lot about what kind of public policies could come from such a non-diverse group,\"<a href=\"http://m.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/05/1770420-ministeriado-de-temer-deve-ser-o-primeiro-sem-mulheres-desde-geisel.shtml\"> wrote</a> Manoela Miklos, a columnist who focuses on women's issues in the Brazilian newspaper <em>Folha de So Paulo.</em></p><p>On the eve of the Senate vote, Rousseff referenced the ongoing struggle for gender equality in the country.</p><p>\"I feel that I have been the victim of an injustice,\" she said Tuesday night, speaking at a conference on women's politics. \"But I am a victim like so many Brazilian men and women, especially the women...we are victims with a will to fight.\"</p><p>Temer is expected to address the nation later Thursday, but has wasted little time in preparing his prospective government in past weeks. </p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/brazil-set-to-lurch-right-president-rousseff-impeachment\"><strong>Related: </strong></a><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/brazil-set-to-lurch-right-president-rousseff-impeachment\">President Rousseff's Likely Impeachment Will Push Brazil to the Right</a><br></p><p>After the impeachment vote in the Senate, the conservative politician announced that a government under his control would reverse many of the programs implemented by the last two Workers' Party administrations.

Dilma supporters have been protesting for weeks during the process that led to her impeachment, saying a reversal of the leftist policies of the Rousseff and Lula administrations would have devastating effects for the country's poor and working class.</p><p>All of Brazil's major political parties have been implicated in a sweeping corruption scandal, called <em>Lava Jato</em> or Car Wash, in which bribes were allegedly paid in exchange for inflated contracts with the state-run oil company Petrobras. </p><p>Temer has not been investigated in connection with the probe, though he has been named by witnesses in the case. He also oversaw Petrobras during the height of the corruption scandal, and approved the questionable accounting measures that were used as justification for Rousseff's impeachment.</p><p>As Rousseff finished her speech, supporters applauded while she departed the presidential palace.

It was a very positive step toward party unity.<br> Reince Priebus (@Reince) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reince/status/730762270150696960\">May 12, 2016</a></blockquote><p>The three men's optimistic tone is strikingly different from just last week, when Ryan said he was \"just not ready\" to endorse Trump for president. Ryan's refusal to stand behind his own party's presumptive nominee sent shock waves through DC and highlighted just how divided the GOP is with Trump as its standard-bearer.</p><p>But making up is hard to do, especially since Ryan and Trump have deep, ideological differences of what it means to be Republican. Ryan has cut entitlement programs, like Medicare, while lowering taxes and successfully reaching a budget deal across the aisle. Trump, on the other hand, has said he would \"leave Medicare the way it is\" and repeatedly bashed the Republican \"establishment\" that Ryan represents, throughout his entire campaign.</p><p>Trump fired back at Ryan's lack of endorsement last Thursday, saying that he in turn wasn't ready \"to support Speaker Ryan's agenda.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!\" Trump said in a statement last week.</p><p>Ryan told reporters in a press conference shortly after their meeting that the two had a good \"first\" meeting, but that the process of uniting the party  and handing over his coveted endorsement  will require more discussions.</p><p>\"The process of unifying the Republican Party ... takes some time,\" Ryan said.</p><p>\"It's very important that we don't fake unifying.\"</p><p>Ryan said that they had discussed his policy proposals as well as Trump's, but their staffs would have to communicate further and get deeper into details before either could officially endorse the other's goals.</p><p>Ryan declined to go into the specifics of his conversation with Trump, noting that the two don't know each other well and are just beginning to build trust. But he said that they discussed some of the party's core principles, including the issue of life and abortion, while also talking through some of their larger policy disagreements, which he did not name. \" heard a lot of good things,\" Ryan said.</p><p>\"He's a very warm and genuine person,\" Ryan added, calling their talk \"very pleasant.\"</p><p>Ryan added that Trump had indicated that he still wants the House Speaker to serve as the chairman of the party's convention in July, and that he is happy to do so.</p><p>Aside from a bland joint statement he released with Ryan after the meeting, focusing on party unity, Trump has not commented publicly on his DC talks with Washington leaders. He quietly left his meeting with House leaders at the Republican National Committee's headquarters Thursday through the back door, avoiding throngs of reporters and a significantly smaller group of protesters, all craning their necks to catch a glimpse of the would-be leader of the free world.</p><p>The apparent lovefest inside the meeting stood in stark contrast to the slow-moving chaos outside the RNC's headquarters Thursday morning.</p><p>The building, near the US Capitol, was surrounded Thursday morning by massive throngs of reporters interspersed with anti-Trump protesters and at least one Trump supporter. Protesters screamed in Spanish and English, largely focusing on immigration, as workers at the nearby Tex-Mex restaurant Tortilla Coast took photos.</p><p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Press waiting for Trump.

While fuzzy on the details, the billionaire businessman linked the commission with plans to be \"extremely vigilant\" on Muslims and Syrian refugees coming to the country, and excoriated President Barack Obama for his refusal to use the term \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"</p><p>\"I'm thinking about setting up a commission, perhaps headed by Rudy Giuliani, to take a very serious look at this problem,\" Trump said.</p><p>On Wednesday night, Giuliani, a Republican and former presidential candidate who was New York's mayor when the 9/11 attacks occurred, lent support to Trump's proposal, despite saying earlier that the plan to ban Muslims from the US entirely was \"unconstitutional.\"</p><p>\"I think the idea of studying how we can best deal with radical Islam, and try to figure how to distinguish between all the good people who are Muslims and the bad ones, is a good idea,\" Giuliani said.</p><p>Giuliani said he was open to the idea of Trump asking him to lead the commission, but remained skeptical that either scenario would come to fruition.</p><p>\" can't use religion as a test or race or gender as a basis for why someone can't come in.\"</p><p>The former mayor added that candidates needed to be \"realistic\" about their immigration proposals, saying that such a ban on Muslims would hurt business as well as propagate the radicalization of individuals. </p><p>\"We have to tell people things that are realistic,\" Giuliani said. \"Thousands and thousands of Egyptians, people from Doha, people from Dubai, people from the Emirates  we do business with them.

The Prussian military used a game called Kriegsspiel to plan their military campaigns. Diplomacy, a table-top game that requires alliance-making and real-world strategizing in order to conquer Europe, was reportedly Henry Kissinger's favorite game. Even the DRDC has had some experience with them  they published a <a href=\"http://pubs.drdc-rddc.gc.ca/BASIS/pcandid/www/engpub/DDW?W%3DSYSNUM=534426\" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=\"1\">report</a> in 2011 saying that matrix gaming proved effective in preparing security for the Vancouver Olympics.</p><p>ISIS Crisis can get surprisingly complex. In the DRDC report on the utility of the game, the military researchers playing the part of the Kurdish army had to quickly professionalize their forces, while the players representing Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi attempted to upgrade their air force, only to fail. As the game progressed, a weakened IS rump managed to smuggle a chemical weapon into Mosul, only to face US special forces. Iran, meanwhile, convinced the Assad government to launch aggressive airstrikes against the self-proclaimed caliphate.</p><blockquote>\"It's an interesting antidote to hubris.\"</blockquote><p>\"This iteration of the ISIS scenario concluded with Iraq launching an offensive to retake Fallujah,\" the report reads. \"Despite receiving air support from the US and being advised both by the US and Iran, the limitations of the Iraqi army were once more made obvious when the offensive collapsed.\"</p><p>Virtually all of the players gave the game positive reviews, with the DRDC concluding that the game resulted in a series of \"useful observations\" about the mission. As a result, the research body says they plan on developing their own matrix game, based on an actual Canadian Forces deployment.</p><p>The Canadian military could use a bit of border thinking about the conflict. One of the first decisions of the Trudeau government, after entering office, was to end the Canadian Forces bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria, instead expanding its special forces training mission with the Kurdish Peshmerga in northern Iraq. The government has received criticism for scaling-down the mission.</p><p>Rex Brynen, a professor at McGill University in Montreal, who helped develop the rules and background for the game  alongside Tom Mouat, a major in the British army  says the analytical nature of the game can be very helpful for military planners.</p><p>\"It's quite useful in that way, in terms of generating a series of issues and questions,\" he told VICE News.</p><p>He doesn't call ISIS Crisis a board game  he says it's more of a \"narrative discussion\" with the game board, cards, and small characters serving as \"aide memoires.\"</p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/2016/05/12/introducing-isis-crisis-the-strategy-board-game-that-the-canadian-military-could-use-to-fight-the-islamic-state-body-image-1463063852.jpg?resize=1220:*&output-quality=75\" data-original-width=\"2016px\" data-original-height=\"1512px\" style=\"\" /></p><p class=\"photo-credit\">Image via PAXSims</p><p>Nevertheless, Brynen says the game is both fun, and profoundly frustrating.</p><p>In the matrix games, there's no real victory. \"You make things better, or you make things worse,\" he says of one particularly difficult scenario involving the ongoing conflict in Libya.

As that snowpack melts, it adds moisture to the mountain forests, leaving them less susceptible to fire.</p><p>But that moisture has also boosted the growth of grasses and other small plants at lower elevations  creating more fuel in those areas. That points to high risks of wildfire for the Southwest and the lower elevations of California, where dry and windy stretches are likely to raise the odds of a big blaze, and in south-central Alaska, where a reduced mountain snowpack and an early warmup are raising the odds of a big fire.</p><p>\"Our biggest concern this summer will be the lower-elevation rangelands of the West,\" Ed Delgado, who runs predictive services for the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) in Boise, Idaho, told reporters last week. \"With the high fuel loadings and the grass crop, we could see a change in the fire season from the higher-elevation timber country to the lower-elevation rangelands this year.\"</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/heres-why-the-alberta-wildfire-just-might-have-a-lot-to-do-with-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related</strong>: Here's Why the Alberta Wildfire Just Might Have a Lot to Do With Climate Change</a><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/heres-why-the-alberta-wildfire-just-might-have-a-lot-to-do-with-climate-change\"></a><br></p><p>But at higher elevations and in the northern Rockies in particular, the additional snow is expected to produce a more normal fire season. That doesn't mean there won't be any fires, but the season will start later, said Philip Higuera, who teaches fire ecology at the University of Montana.</p><p>\"The timing of snowpack is well-linked to the number of large fires we expect to see in the summer. And when snowpack melts, that's what starts the clock ticking as far as allowing fuels to dry out to the point they can burn,\" he said.</p><p>And while most of California is still in the grip of a deep, lengthy drought, \"The rest of the West has recovered quite a bit,\" NIFC spokeswoman Jennifer Smith said.</p><p> \"It is looking better. Compared to last year at this time, everybody was having a drought throughout the West,\" Smith said.</p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/2016/05/12/untitled-article-1463061346-body-image-1463061663.png?resize=1220:*&output-quality=75\" data-original-width=\"1650px\" data-original-height=\"1275px\" style=\"\" /></p><p>The United States saw a record 10 million-plus acres burned in 2015  a year that cost the federal Forest Service more than $2.6 billion, forcing it to shift resources from other programs that could prevent future blazes. Nearly half of that acreage was in remote Alaska, where authorities could manage the blazes with little danger to people, Smith said.</p><p>But the more populated West has been primed for bigger fires by the long-term effects of climate change, experts say. A wildfire north of San Francisco ballooned to tens of thousands of acres within hours of being touched off last September, sweeping through two small towns.</p><p>A typical fire season is nearly three months longer than it was in 1970, and there's less water available to fight a blaze. The acreage lost to fires has topped 5 million in 10 of the last 15 years, the Forest Service says.</p><p>The expectation is that this year is likely to be closer to the average for most of the West  but average doesn't mean no fires, Higuera cautions.</p><p>\"The presence of fire itself is not unusual,\" he said. It's a natural part of the forest environment. But an increase in bigger, more frequent fires over a period of decades does have wildland managers concerned.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/the-fort-mcmurray-fire-created-lightning-that-set-off-new-blazes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related</strong>: The Fort McMurray Fire Created Lightning That Set Off New Blazes</a><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/the-fort-mcmurray-fire-created-lightning-that-set-off-new-blazes\"></a><br></p><p>In the far north of Alberta, Canada, a fire that erupted May 1 forced more than 80,000 people to flee from the city of Fort McMurray, the hub of Canada's oil sands.

Forty-nine out of 81 senators, 303 out of 513 congress members, and 37 of the 65 members of the Congressional Impeachment Commission, from parties across the political spectrum, are facing charges or investigations for serious crimes.</p><p>Dressed in white, and speaking firmly to journalists in front of the presidential palace, Rousseff addressed the nation on Thursday in her last speech as president of Brazil.</p><p>\"The most devastating injustice is the conviction of an innocent person,\" she said. \"When a president is elected and then removed for a crime they didn't commit, that is called a coup.\"</p><p>Rousseff, supported by a crowd gathered around the presidential palace, promised to continue to fight her impeachment until the end of her mandate, on December 31, 2018.</p><p>\"I have made mistakes, but I have committed no crime,\" she added. \"This coup does not only aim to remove me, but to overturn my government and its policies, which were chosen by the majority of Brazilians.\"</p><p>She then asked her supporters not to recognize the impeachment process, however, to do it peacefully and without violence. </p><p>\"I admit I never thought it would be necessary to fight against another coup in our country,\" Rousseff said. \"It is a fight that can be won, and we are going to win it.\"</p><p>As she left the palace without taking questions from journalists, a group of supporters applauded and cheered \"Temer out.\"<br></p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/dilma-rousseff-close-to-impeachment-not-all-brazilians-hate-her\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related:</strong> Dilma Rousseff Is Close to Being Impeached, but Not All Brazilians Hate Her</a></p><p>They were referring to Michel Temer, Rousseff's vice-president who will take over for six months as she undergoes an impeachment trial in the senate and has been investigated for bribery and kickbacks twice. He also oversaw Petrobras during the height of the corruption scandal, and approved the fiscal accounting measures that Rousseff is being impeached for.</p><p>Temer is the leader of the PMDB, the largest party in Brazil, which does not have an ideological base but says it is committed to economic stability. While he also faces an impeachment process himself he has enough support in both houses that he does not need to worry.</p><p>Earlier on Thursday he signed a document that makes his position as interim president official.</p><p>Interim President Temer has ruled out holding fresh elections, despite recent polls showing a majority of Brazilians want them, and has spent the past few weeks assembling a new cabinet to take over and promising to adopt pro-market policies. He says they will get Brazil's budget deficit under control, rein in inflation, and get the economy growing again.</p><p>Temer faces immense challenges as he takes on not only Brazil's biggest recession in decades, but also the Zika virus epidemic, in the run-up to the Olympic Games in Rio in August  with an approval rating among Brazilians of just 12 percent.</p><p>However, many Brazilians were elated by the removal of Dilma Rousseff.</p><p>Fireworks could be heard around the country's capital of Brasilia Thursday morning.

Outside the CVS Pharmacy destroyed in the chaos  it's now newly renovated  uniformed police officers lingered on the sidelines during as crowds reflected on the 25-year-old's death while in police custody.</p><p>Kevin Moore, who shot a much-viewed cell phone video of Gray's arrest, raised two middle fingers and yelled \"Fuck that!\" at a drone buzzing overhead as bystanders wondered aloud whether it was being operated by the police. A few minutes later, Moore maneuvered a giant barbecue through the crowd to grill hot dogs while people shared their own stories of police brutality, staged spoken-word performances, sang, and demanded greater police accountability.</p><p>Nearby, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake hosted a separate \"Day of Reconciliation\" event. It was not as well-attended.</p><p>The week of anniversary events commemorating Gray, his death, and its aftermath has passed, but the process of accountability for the <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/grand-jury-indicts-six-baltimore-officers-involved-in-freddie-grays-death\">six officers facing charges</a> related to his arrest and death is just beginning. The trials resume today with the case of Edward M. Nero, one of the officers involved in Gray's arrest. He has pleaded not guilty to four misdemeanors including second-degree assault, misconduct in office, and reckless endangerment in connection with Gray's death.</p><p>Two of Nero's colleagues are expected to take the stand against him. Never before in Maryland have co-defendants with pending charges for the same crime been forced to testify against each other.</p><p>Nero was one of three officers on bike patrol near the Gilmor Homes public housing complex on April 12, 2015 who arrested Gray after he ran from police. Officers found a switchblade knife on Gray. Nero and two colleagues appear in Moore's video<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">, which</span> shows Gray, his hands cuffed behind his back, being lifted into the back of a police van where, fatefully, he was not seat-belted. </p><p>In pretrial motions Tuesday, Circuit Court Judge Barry Williams granted a number of motions limiting the information that will be presented in Nero's trial. At the defense's request, any video of Gray's arrest shown in court will have the audio muted on the grounds that Gray's wailing and the commentary of onlookers could prejudice the case; a \"step-by-step\" rehashing of Gray's injuries sustained after the arrest will not be permitted, nor will discussion of Gray's past run-ins with the law and his exposure to lead poisoning as a child. The state will not be allowed to argue that the knife found on Gray was legal, as their case argues that the knife was found after Nero committed the alleged wrongful arrest.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/we-spoke-to-kevin-moore-the-man-who-filmed-freddie-grays-arrest\"><strong>Related: </strong>We Spoke to Kevin Moore, the Man Who Filmed Freddie Gray's Arrest</a></p><p>Nero also waived his right to a jury Tuesday, and will instead have his fate decided by Williams, who said his verdict would \"certainly not be based on emotion.\" Nero's verdict will be the first in these high-profile cases, and could come as early as next week.</p><p>The trials have been on hold since December, when a <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/hung-jury-leads-to-mistrial-in-case-of-cop-involved-in-freddie-gray-death\">mistrial was declared</a> in the case of 26-year-old officer William G. Porter. Months of delays followed while Maryland's highest court grappled with the key question of whether Porter can be forced to testify under limited immunity while he still has pending charges against him in Gray's death, including involuntary manslaughter and second-degree assault. Prosecutors allege that Porter, who was called to the arrest while on neighborhood patrol, repeatedly failed to respond to Gray's requests for medical attention.</p><p>Porter's immunity means that his compelled testimony cannot be used against him at his own trial. His lawyers argued to a panel of judges in March that forcing him to testify was nevertheless a violation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. But the Maryland Court of Appeals sided with prosecutors, who argued that Porter's version of events is central to their case against at least two of the officers, and that the immunity protects his rights. </p><p>The prosecution followed up the victory by compelling a second officer to testify; Porter and Officer Edward Miller are both expected to take the stand in Nero's trial this week. Porter could, in fact, be called to testify against all five fellow officers.</p><p>According to Douglas Colbert, a University of Maryland law professor who has been following the trials, the appeals court decision illustrates an important point about the right to remain silent: It's not infallible.</p><p>Colbert says compelled testimony is the sole option for breaking the police code of silence given the already \"extraordinary\" fact that the officers have been charged at all. \"It's the only way a prosecutor can gain the cooperation of a police witness to a crime,\" he said.</p><p>But, he added, \"The only reason this is unprecedented is because police officers are rarely prosecuted,\" pointing to a Bowling Green State University study finding that during a seven-year period ending in 2011, just 41 officers in the US were charged with murder or manslaughter in connection with on-duty shootings. </p><p>While the charges against Nero are relatively minor compared to those faced by the other officers, the outcome of his trial is expected to have major implications, particularly for Lieutentant Brian Rice and Officer Garrett Miller, who also appear in video footage of the arrest. The case against all three relates primarily to whether there was probable cause to pursue and arrest Gray in the first place. The cases against Porter, Sargent Alicia White, and Officer Caesar R. Goodson are quite different, relating more specifically to the injuries sustained by Gray in the police van, and the alleged failure of the three to provide medical attention. </p><p>Officials concluded that Gray suffered several <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/autopsy-says-freddie-gray-died-after-sustaining-high-energy-injury-in-police-van\">neck and spinal cord injuries</a> while in the van and was not given prompt medical attention. He died of his injuries a week later, sparking widespread protests and rioting across Baltimore. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan called in the National Guard, and a week-long curfew was put in place by Rawlings-Blake. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts was fired for his handling of the unrest.</p><p>On May 1, 2015, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby charged the six officers in connection with Gray's death, prefacing the announcement with a promise of justice: \"To the people of Baltimore and demonstrators across America, I hear your call for 'No justice, no peace.'\"</p><blockquote>'We don't have the intent to kill, but we really don't care if that happens  that's depraved heart murder.'</blockquote><p>Nevertheless, David Jaros, a former public defender and University of Baltimore law professor, along with other legal experts, have questioned the strength of the state's case against the officers, and the likelihood that they will face jail time.</p><p>\"These are very difficult cases to prove beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Jaros said of the charges, which range from misdemeanor assaults to second degree depraved heart murder. The latter, most serious charge is faced by Goodson, the driver of the van, whom prosecutors allege gave Gray a \"rough ride\" during a 45-minute trip to the Western District police station, where Gray was discovered unconscious.</p><p>The charge, characterized by a callous and wanton disregard for human life, will be \"extremely hard to prove\" for the prosecution, says Jaros. He likens the crime to throwing cinder blocks off a roof into a crowd below. \"We're not aiming for anyone, we don't have the intent to kill, but we really don't care if that happens  that's depraved heart murder.\"</p><p>To convict Nero in this week's trial, prosecutors must prove that he lacked probable cause to make the arrest that led to Gray's death, and that in doing so he used an unnecessary amount of force  another extremely difficult theory to prove, according to Baltimore-based attorney Warren Alperstein. </p><p>In a high-crime area, \"officers are allowed to pursue an individual who flees from police unprovoked, detain them, and frisk them,\" he says, adding that this policy is based on the same Supreme Court case, Illinois v. Wardlow, used to defend the New York City Police Department's controversial stop-and-frisk policy. </p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/fearing-a-catastrophic-incident-400-federal-officers-descended-on-the-baltimore-protests\"><strong>Related:</strong> Fearing a 'Catastrophic Incident,' 400 Federal Officers Descended on the Baltimore Protests</a></p><p>But even a conviction on relatively minor charges such as those face by Nero could jeopardize the officers' careers. An assault conviction could land Nero in jail for up to 10 years.</p><p>The trials are expected to be closely watched by prosecutors who are weighing the risk of bringing brutality cases against police, with whom they work hand-in-hand to build cases. \"For prosecutors, a lot will ride on what the long-term takeaway of this case is,\" says Jaros, setting a precedent for \"whether it's political suicide to aggressively pursue police brutality cases.\"</p><p>The six officers' trials are scheduled to run through October. All will be presided over by Williams.</p><p><em>Follow Annalies Winny on Twitter: <a class=\"ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav\" href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnaliesWinny\">@AnnaliesWinny</a></em></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/cops-will-testify-against-cops-as-trials-for-freddie-grays-arrest-and-death-resume\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/cops-will-testify-against-cops-as-trials-for-freddie-grays-arrest-and-death-resume#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[American Mennonites Are Going To Iraq \u2014 To Fix Windows]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/american-mennonites-are-going-to-iraq-to-fix-windows</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Campbell MacDiarmid for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:50:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA band of young, devout Christians traveled to the middle of a war zone in Sinjar, a stone's throw from Islamic State fighters.

Riding shotgun next to him is Eric Detweiler, also 22, from Colon, Michigan.<br></p><p>But they aren't soldiers, or private military contractors, or even civilians who have come to war-ravaged northern Iraq to take part in the fight against Islamic State, as dozens of others have done. They are devout Christians from a Protestant sect known more for shying away from the world than for going out to war zones  but they aren't in Iraq to proselytize in a largely Muslim land, they say.</p><p>They are volunteers  and the reason they are here becomes clear when looking at the truck's bed, where Delvin Zimmerman, a 26-year-old from the same church as Martin in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, clutches a large pane of glass. They have come to help rebuild a town destroyed by war.</p><p>More than six months after Sinjar was retaken from Islamic State militants, a small group of North American Mennonite volunteers is the only permanent humanitarian presence in this ghost town at the foot of Mount Sinjar.</p><p>Sinjar used to be an agricultural hub, whose 50,000 inhabitants included Yezidis, Kurds, and Arabs.</p><p>In summer 2014, it became synonymous with the mass atrocities committed by Islamic State extremists as they swept through northern Iraq. The IS militants displaced an estimated 90 percent of Iraq's Yezidi religious minority, killing thousands and enslaving many more of their women and children. Those from Sinjar who could escape fled to the mountain above the town. In response, a US-led coalition began a campaign of airstrikes that inaugurated the West's war against the Islamic State, and helped Kurdish and Yezidi militias retake the city last November.</p><p>But the cost of Sinjar's liberation was its near-total destruction, and since then little has been done to rebuild. Local militias have cleared an estimated 40 tons of improvised explosive devices left behind by the retreating jihadists, but with an estimated 85 percent of homes destroyed or damaged, and with no functioning services, only a handful of civilians have returned.</p><p>The Mennonite volunteers are hoping to encourage more families to come back by cleaning up looted homes, fixing broken windows, and installing doors. Returning Yezidis say they are grateful for any help, but with no one in Iraq or overseas volunteering to pay the billion-dollar repair bill for the city's infrastructure, local officials now question whether Sinjar is beyond saving.</p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/2016/05/11/untitled-article-1462990131-body-image-1462994577.jpg?resize=1220:*&output-quality=75\" data-original-width=\"1280px\" data-original-height=\"853px\" style=\"\" /></p><p class=\"photo-credit\"><em>Eric Detweiler installs a pane of glass in Sinjar.</em><em> (Photo by Campbell MacDiarmid/VICE News)</em><br></p><p>Martin stops the truck in front of an old house occupied by fighters from the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK. Inside they quickly install the glass in the window of a high-ceilinged room furnished with just a ping-pong table. Their job done, they shake hands with the fighters, who thank them for the new windows.</p><p>\"We really appreciate the support of our foreign friends who have come here to rebuild Sinjar,\" Heval Mohamed, a stern-faced guerrilla, says. \"We accept any help from any side.\"</p><p>The Mennonites have no allegiance to any side in this fight. They're doing this to help civilians, they say. \"We'll fix the glass for a military group if the house is going to go back to a family afterwards,\" says Martin.</p><p>The PKK is listed as a terrorist organization by the US government, for its bloody 30-year insurrection against the Turkish government. But its armed wing was also the first to come to the aid of the beleaguered Yezidis after the peshmerga militia from another Kurdish faction retreated from Sinjar in August 2014. The PKK is now losing influence to the Kurdistan Democratic Party, or KDP, the dominant party in Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region.</p><p>The Yezidis for their part are deeply distrustful of both the Kurds and of their former Arab neighbors, many of whom participated in the slaughter of an estimated 1,000 Yezidis just in Sinjar town alone. Many Yezidis now oppose the return of any Arabs or even Kurds to the town.</p><p>The Mennonites navigate this complex landscape of rubble and rivalries with a single-minded focus on their stated mission. \"We do windows and doors,\" says Martin, waiting for dinner back at the house they have refurbished in the town. \"I figured it's something we can start at. We're a small organization with limited donations.\"</p><p>Plain Compassion Crisis Response was formed in September 2014 by members of the Mennonite communities of Lancaster and Franklin counties, horrified by television reports showing the plight of the Yezidis. \"We got people together and said, 'Let's go,'\" Martin says. \"It got formed kinda out of chaos and we've been trying to organize the chaos ever since.\"</p><p>The first members of the group bought plane tickets to northern Iraq and landed in October 2014 without knowing exactly what they would find or what assistance they could give. But service is a core value of the Mennonites, Martin says, and they were determined to help.</p><p>Martin arrived in January 2015, and worked in Duhok province helping to improve the accommodation of displaced Iraqis, many of whom live in unfinished homes. After the earthquake in Nepal last year he flew there to provide aid, but when Sinjar was freed last November he was drawn back. Winning over local officials with his plan to help rebuild, he was offered a house to move into. \"I thought, OK, we'll move in, and worry about everything else later,\" he recalls.</p><p>None of the volunteers had experienced conflict zones before coming to Iraq, although a few of them underwent five days of emergency response training that included being shot by paintball guns. \"A lot of people in our church are more involved with local issues, they're not as big on going into war zones,\" Martin says. \"I'm a little bit of an oddball when it comes to that.\"</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/in-photos-kurdish-forces-celebrate-routing-the-islamic-state-from-sinjar\"><strong>Related:</strong> In Photos: Kurdish Forces Celebrate Routing the Islamic State From Sinjar</a></p><p>One of the original Anabaptist sects to emerge from the Protestant reformation, the Mennonites are similar to the Amish  who are famous for riding horse-drawn buggies and avoiding modern conveniences  but less bound by rigid rules. Most live in agricultural communities, where hard work and service to others are predominant values. They aren't the sort of Western aid worker often seen in war zones. Their church, in fact, preaches non-violence.</p><p>\"I wouldn't necessarily say we're pacifists,\" says Joshua Kurtz, a 23-year-old son of a preacher from Snowhill, Maryland. \"That sounds as if we're passive. But we're definitely against war.\"</p><p>While the volunteers all cite seeing the horrors of ISIS on television as motivation for wanting to help, none seem particularly worried by the thought that the fighters remain just kilometers away and would surely relish the opportunity to harm or capture American Christians.</p><p>\"It's just awesome,\" says 20-year-old Marylander Jennel Kauffman, \"being in a war zone. The best part is seeing people get home again.\"</p><p>One of two women in the group, she works alongside the men, but she and 26-year-old Virginian Elizabeth Yoder also rise early to bake cookies and prepare breakfasts of biscuits and gravy.</p><p>Yoder is also nonchalant about the risks of living in the shadow of IS. She grew up speaking the German dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch in an Amish community before joining a Mennonite Church, and living in the rubble of a Middle Eastern war is as far from home as it gets. But she says she's adjusted well: \"Growing up in an Amish house probably makes it easier for me to live here without modern conveniences.\"</p><p><strong>Watch VICE News' </strong><em><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Reclaiming Sinjar: Pushing Back the Islamic State:</strong></em></p><div><div class=\"responsive-wrapper ooyala-wrapper\" ><iframe src=\"//embeds.vice.com/?playerId=YjMwNmI4YjU2MGM5ZWRjMzRmMjljMjc5&aid=news.vice.com/war-conflict&vid=dzdW95eDrKBhMJZbc44VDpu9po7S4hbf&embedCode=dzdW95eDrKBhMJZbc44VDpu9po7S4hbf&cust_params=embdom%3D%25252F%25252Fnews.vice.com%25252Fvideo%25252Fpushing-back-the-islamic-state%26topic%3Dwar-conflict%26auth%3Dvice-news%26keywords%3Dsinjar%252Cislamic-state%252Ckurdistan%252Ckurds%252Cpeshmerga%252Cyazidi%252Cobama%252Cpkk%252Cartillery%252Ctanks%252Ccoalition%252Cmortar%252Cmass-graves%252Cvice%252Cvice-news%252Cdocumentaries%252Cmiddle-east%252Cwar-conflict%26ac%3Dno%26country%3Den%26contentId%3DdzdW95eDrKBhMJZbc44VDpu9po7S4hbf%26aid%3Dpushing-back-the-islamic-state&ad_rule=1&description_url=%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fvideo%2Fpushing-back-the-islamic-state&share_url=%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fvideo%2Fpushing-back-the-islamic-state&autoplay=1\" width=\"\" height=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-original-width=\"1000px\" data-original-height=\"598px\" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p><p>While Martin heads a small core of semi-permanent staff in the town, including Yoder and Kauffman, Kurtz is part of a group of five on a two-week rotation working in Iraq as part of a seven-month Christian adventure gap year.

It's a good job that they're doing,\" he says, sitting outside his house and smoking a water pipe. \"Suoro fixed my windows,\" he adds, calling Martin by the Kurdish nickname, Red, his sunburn has earned him.</p><p>Haji has bigger problems than broken windows and looted doors, though. \"It's a lousy situation in the city today,\" he says. \"There's no water, no proper electricity, and a shortage of food.\"</p><p>There are also rumors that IS will counterattack. \"I've sent my family back to live on the mountain above the town,\" Haji says. \"I'll wait until the situation is safe before I bring them back.\"</p><p>The local head of security in Sinjar also agrees that the town is still too dangerous for civilians. In a heavily defended house, requisitioned by his fighters, Major Qassem Simo, who heads the KDP's <i>Asayish</i> security in Sinjar, says, \"the main challenge for us is civilians wanting to return. We try and explain to them that we prefer if they don't return because it is not safe yet.\"</p><p>There is still the danger of ISIS booby traps and indirect fire. Shelling hit the town in early May. \"ISIS is only five miles from the city, in some places closer,\" Simo says. \"The peshmerga have cleared 90 percent of the town but there could still be booby traps under the rubble.\"</p><p>The Mennonite volunteers are undeterred by the danger. \"You hear 'em coming in, hear 'em whistling,\" Martin says of the shelling. \"But as long as it don't get too loud, it ain't too close.\"</p><p>He is similarly dismissive of the lingering danger of booby traps and unexploded munitions: \"We hardly find IEDs any more. They cleared 'em up real good,\" he says of the Improvised Explosive Devices that IS left behind by the ton.</p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/2016/05/11/untitled-article-1462990131-body-image-1462994384.jpg?resize=1220:*&output-quality=75\" data-original-width=\"1280px\" data-original-height=\"853px\" style=\"\" /></p><p class=\"photo-credit\">The Mennonite volunteers working in Sinjar start their day with calisthenics.

The 23-year-old gives medical training to Yezidi militiamen stationed around Sinjar, but now lives in the less damaged town of Snuni to the north of Sinjar mountain. \"Thousands of people are moving back to Snuni, why don't they work there?\" he asks. \"No one wants to move back to Sinjar under the attacks and the rockets, they want to leave it as a memorial.\"</p><p>Even the mayor acknowledges that the town may never be rebuilt. \"As the administration, we believe that it would be a good idea to build a new Sinjar elsewhere,\" says Mahama Khalil Qassem, from his office in the ruined town. \"This would be better economically, security-wise, and in terms of people's psychological well-being.\"</p><p>Qassem estimates that the cost of rebuilding could be up to $10 billion and says so far neither the Iraqi central authorities in Baghdad nor the Kurdistan Regional Government have offered up the money. Both administrations are facing budget crises brought on by falling oil prices and the ongoing cost of war, and with other destroyed cities vying for reconstruction funds, Sinjar is not top priority.</p><p>The Mennonite volunteers say they'll keep working, regardless. The day after fixing up the PKK base, the whole team was busy sweeping out a burned-out house, filling wheelbarrows with charred home furnishings, and clearing the broken glass from window frames.</p><p>\"The only complaint people who live here have,\" Martin says, \"is that we don't get there fast enough sometimes.\"</p><p><em>Follow Campbell MacDiarmid on Twitter:</em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/campbellmacd\"><em>@Campbell MacD</em></a></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/american-mennonites-are-going-to-iraq-to-fix-windows\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/american-mennonites-are-going-to-iraq-to-fix-windows#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[The Fight For Trauma Care On Chicago's South Side ]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/video/the-fight-for-trauma-care-on-chicagos-south-side</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:16:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago currently has four trauma centers for victims of gun violence.

It is capable of shooting down rockets from countries such as Iran that Washington says could one day reach major European cities.</p><p>\"Iran continues to develop, test, and deploy a full range of ballistic missile capabilities and those capabilities are increasing in range and accuracy,\" said Frank Rose, deputy US assistant secretary of state for arms control.</p><p>\"Iran's systems can reach into parts of Europe, including Romania,\" Rose said, before heading to the site to join US Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg for a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 9am GMT.</p><p>When complete, the defensive umbrella will stretch from Greenland to the Azores. On Friday, the US will break ground on a final site in Poland that should be ready by the end of 2018, completing the shield first proposed almost a decade ago that also includes ships and radars across Europe.</p><p>It will be handed over to NATO control in July.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/the-us-is-sending-thousands-more-armed-troops-and-heavy-weaponry-to-eastern-europe\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related</strong>: The US Is Sending Thousands More Armed Troops and Heavy Weaponry to Eastern Europe</a></p><p>Russia is incensed at such of show of force by its Cold War rival in formerly communist-ruled eastern Europe. Moscow says the US-led alliance is trying to encircle it close to the strategically important Black Sea, home to a Russian naval fleet and where NATO is also considering increasing patrols.</p><p>\"It is part of the military and political containment of Russia,\" Andrey Kelin, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, said on Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported.</p><p>\"These decisions by NATO can only exacerbate an already difficult situation,\" he added, saying the move would hinder efforts to repair ties between Russia and the alliance.</p><p>The readying of the shield also comes as NATO prepares a new deterrent in Poland and the Baltics, following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. In response, Russia is reinforcing its western and southern flanks with three new divisions.</p><p>The Kremlin says the shield's aim is to neutralize Moscow's nuclear arsenal long enough for the US to strike Russia in the event of war.

Sensors then measure the rocket's trajectory and destroy it in space before it re-enters the earth's atmosphere. The interceptors can be fired from ships or ground sites.</p><p>While US and NATO officials are adamant that the shield is designed to counter threats from the Middle East and not Russia, they remained vague on whether the radars and interceptors could be reconfigured to defend against Russia in a conflict.</p><p>The US says Russia has ballistic missiles, in breach of a treaty that agreed the two powers must not develop and deploy missiles with a range of 500 km (310.69 miles) to 5,500 km. The US declared Russia in non-compliance of the treaty in July 2014.</p><p>The issue remains sensitive because the US does not want to give the impression it would be able to shoot down Russian ballistic missiles that were carrying nuclear warheads, which is what Russia fears.</p><p><em>Follow VICE News on Twitter: </em><em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/vicenews\" target=\"_blank\">@vicenews</a></em></p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/russia-threatens-retaliation-if-us-puts-heavy-weaponry-in-eastern-europe\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related</strong>: The US Army Doesn't Seem Real Sure It Could Stop a Russian Invasion of Europe</a></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/the-us-is-switching-on-an-800-missile-defense-system-in-eastern-europe\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/the-us-is-switching-on-an-800-missile-defense-system-in-eastern-europe#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[What Is The Pentagon's Multi-Billion Dollar F-35 Jet Actually Supposed To Do?]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/what-is-the-pentagons-multi-billion-f-35-jet-actually-supposed-to-do-1</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ryan Faith for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 09:40:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US (along with almost a dozen countries) is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a new and controversial fighter jet.

The main Lockheed Martin factory for the F-35, located in Fort Worth, Texas, is beginning the long ramp-up to get to full-scale production, which is expected by 2019. The F-35 is supposed to replace in whole or in part a large number of different aircraft types and is intended to operate for at least 50 years.</p><p>So, naturally, one of the very first things people want to know is whether or not the plane is any damned good. The US taxpayer is footing a bill that, over the next several decades, will run several hundred billion dollars and involve buying a couple thousand aircraft, and critics have complained that the jack-of-all-trades F-35 is a master of none.</p><p>In a bid to get a handle on that, VICE News went to Naval Air Station Patuxent River (a.k.a. Pax River) in Maryland to talk to some F-35 test pilots and get a fundamental grip on why and how the plane will be used. The Navy is the second-biggest customer of the plane, after the US Air Force and before the Marines and several allied nations. It plans to replace most of its F-18 Hornets with it.</p><p>US Navy Commander Christian \"Wilson\" Sewell, a top Navy F-35 test pilot at Pax River, is happy with his new ride. \"I love the F-18, I grew up with the F-18, I'm a Hornet baby, but bottom line is that I'd take the F-35 into combat,\" said Sewell, who until a few weeks ago also ran a lot of the F-35 testing program.</p><p>But taking a machine into combat means many things. As you might expect, there are a ton of contentious (but not always well-informed) arguments about whether the F-35 is good, bad, or indifferent. But often those arguments miss the most basic question: What is the plane actually supposed to do?</p><p>To suss that out, it's best to start with the late Colonel John Boyd of the US Air Force, and his OODA Loop. The acronym stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act, and it's a pretty decent model of how people or organizations make decisions (in war, business, and everything else).</p><p>There is a lot of nuance baked into the model, but a super simplified version of the OODA Loop is that first, some event occurs and someone notices it (Observe). That person then gets busy positioning herself mentally and physically to figure out why she gives a damn and what the hell she's supposed to think about all this (Orient). Now that she's facing the event, she chooses some course of action (Decide) and then actually does whatever it is she's going to do (Act). This action creates some sort of effect out there in the world. Whatever happens next is the new event that kicks off the cycle again. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/how-americas-new-invisible-flying-gas-stations-could-keep-russia-in-check\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related:</strong> How America's New Invisible Flying Gas Stations Could Keep Russia in Check</a><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/how-americas-new-invisible-flying-gas-stations-could-keep-russia-in-check\"></a><br></p><p>When applied to combat jets, the first phase of the decision cycle, the Observe phase, is all about who sees who coming first. The F-35 is stealthy (or, as military jargon would have it, \"Low Observable\"), which means it's hard for other aircraft to see with radar and other sensors. Aircraft are made stealthy through a combination of radar-absorbent coatings and shapes that deflect returning radar signals away from the transmitter. If two identical planes have the same sensors, but one is stealthy, then the stealthy aircraft will see the non-stealthy one a long time before it gets seen itself.</p><p>The second piece of the Observe phase is the sensors. And the F-35 is absolutely chock-full of electronic sensors. Synthetic aperture radar, Digital Radio Frequency Memory, multispectral infra-red, Distributed Aperture System, and all kinds of other stuff with hard-to-pin-down but impressive-sounding names. It is, in theory, supposed to do things that are currently done by aircraft like the E-2 Hawkeye, EA-6B Prowler, E-8 JSTARS, E-3 Sentry (a.k.a. AWACS), and the RC-135 family of aircraft.</p><p>The first two aircraft, the E-2 Hawkeye and EA-6B Prowler, are Navy radar and electronic warfare planes, launched from aircraft carriers. The latter three are land-based aircraft that respectively watch the movement of vehicles on the ground, observe and control aircraft, and do a whole slew of electronic reconnaissance and jamming. Collectively, these aircraft are part of a class of things called \"enablers.\" Enablers don't fight directly, but they enable other jets to get on with their main job: blowing stuff up. In this case, those aircraft enable other jets, ground forces, and ships by providing good sensor coverage and electronic warfare capabilities.<br></p><p>Normally, aircraft are specialized, particularly enablers. Aircraft big enough (think commercial airliner size) to slog around the big radar an E-3 Sentry uses are going to be lousy at air-to-air combat; meanwhile, any aircraft agile enough to be a decent dogfighter is going to be too small to carry a massive radar. But something happened along the way with stealth. Stealth isn't perfect invisibility, it just makes a plane harder to find. So in order to use stealth, more advanced stealth aircraft started packing in a whole lot of sensors to see where hostile radars were and avoid them. From there, it was just one more step to take the advanced sensors that would have to go on a new stealth strike fighter and dial all that up a few notches.</p><p>Certainly, the small physical size and available power of the F-35 places hard limits on how well it can perform the roles normally played by specialist enabler aircraft. There's just no way an airframe that size can carry as large an antenna or generate as much power as a larger aircraft or one that doesn't have to carry weapons and other gear. But, in the end, the F-35 is the first attack aircraft that can perform electronic warfare and reconnaissance roles in any meaningful way.<br></p><p>Even if the F-35 isn't filling the full range of roles of dedicated aircraft and can't perform those missions quite as well as specialist planes, it's still a significant step to get that recon, jamming, and combat gear all loaded on the same jet.</p><p>For example, the F-35 is supposed to be able to \"autonomously find surface to air missile systems,\" Sewell said. \"To autonomously find them, to detect them, to track them, engage them, and egress. To be able to do that mission using typical legacy systems , but it's also in my helmet, so I just look, and there he is. 'Fox 3,' here goes the missile off toward him,\" he said, using the radio code for missiles guided by radar.</p><p>Which finally brings us to the Act phase of the process. Most of what the F-35 does isn't necessarily going to have a huge effect on action in all cases; a lot of that could be, for instance, a matter of weapons or missiles, rather than the plane that carries them.</p><p>Most of the interesting stuff that's new in the Act phase has to do with all the electronics the F-35 is schlepping around (and they're pretty classified). One cool bit is this idea of cooperative targeting; it's where one plane or ship carries a missile, but a different plane manages it. So you might have a big, old, non-stealthy aircraft tooling around way in the back, just lugging around missiles. The F-35 can ask for a missile to be fired off in its general direction. The F-35 then takes control of the missile, feeds it targeting information, and then uses it to blow stuff up.</p><p>There have also been a few rumors about the F-35's super-advanced radar that suggest it might even be able send an electronic signal as part of a cyber attack on the bad guy's electronics.</p><p>Now, like I said, this is a kind of rough take on all this stuff, but the big deal here  the point of the F-35, basically  is to change the way the plane is operated in combat through collapsing the amount of time needed to carry out the Observe and Orient phases, giving the pilot more time to focus on strategy and decision-making. The plane is able to do this mostly because it takes a lot of capabilities that were done by specialist aircraft and puts those capabilities on the fighter itself, allowing it to operate without having to call in a whole slew of support planes.</p><p>This is, in part, a reason the debate surrounding the F-35 has been so bitter. The plane is trying to fill a different role than any of its predecessors, rather than simply improving on older versions of the same thing. Previous generations of combat aircraft have been steady evolutionary advancements along the same track; each new plane until now has focused on going faster, farther, and higher than its predecessor.</p><p>The F-35 is trying to evolve in a different way. It won't be a great deal more powerful or maneuverable than the aircraft it replaces; rather, it is supposed to be a different kind of beast. The value or vulnerability of the F-35 isn't fully captured by watching Maverick and Goose zipping around the sky in <i>Top Gun</i>.</p><p>Whether or not the F-35 is worth its monster price tag is still an entirely different question. For starters, the question of what the F-35 does is entirely different from what the F-35 is supposed to do when used with other planes and ships and stuff.

His early release in August 2013 on a technicality triggered a storm of protest from the US, and fury within the DEA where he is hated with particular intensity.</p><p>The 63-year-old is now, once again, a fugitive from Mexican justice. The DEA is also currently offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his recapture. </p><p>The treasury department claims that Espinoza met Caro Quintero while the two were both in jail. She was arrested, it says, in 2008 with her then husband, a Colombian drug trafficker, and was convicted of trafficking and money laundering herself.</p><p>The statement does not say when Espinoza was released from jail and became, according to DEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley \"a key enabler and facilitator for Caro Quintero and his vicious global drug trafficking and money laundering regime.\"</p><p>Shortly prior to his release from jail and disappearance, the treasury department surprised many by claiming that Caro Quintero remained a major force in Mexico's drug trafficking scene by including several of his relatives in the Kingpin Act. The act bans any US citizen or company from financial relations with individuals or companies linked to the people it lists.</p><p>Caro Quintero was one of the founders of the Guadalajara cartel in the 1970s, considered to be Mexico's first real drug trafficking organization and which had close ties to Pablo Escobar.<br></p><p>After the Guadalajara cartel fell apart in the early '90s, many of its younger members went on to form their own organizations  including the Sinaloa cartel, the Juarez cartel in Ciudad Jurez, and the Arellano Felix organization in Tijuana.</p><p>Since leaving prison, the veteran drug lord has reputedly regained his status as an on-the-ground player in the Sinaloa cartel, thanks to his tutelage of Joaqun \"El Chapo\" Guzmn and Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada in the '70s and '80s.<br></p><p>El Chapo Guzmn is currently incarcerated in a Mexican prison in Jurez just across the border from Texas. He has been in prison since he was arrested in January after a massive manhunt unleashed after his spectacular jailbreak six months before. He was moved there early Saturday morning amidst speculation that he may soon be extradited.</p><p>El Mayo Zambada remains a fugitive with a huge reward for his capture.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/after-el-chapo-the-worlds-10-most-wanted-drug-lords-dea\"><strong>Related:</strong> After El Chapo: The World's 10 Most Wanted Drug Lords</a></p><p><br></p><p><em>Follow Nathaniel Janowitz on Twitter: </em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ngjanowitz\" target=\"_blank\">@ngjanowitz</a></em><br></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/common-law-wife-of-one-of-the-deas-most-hated-drug-lords-added-to-us-kingpin-list\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/common-law-wife-of-one-of-the-deas-most-hated-drug-lords-added-to-us-kingpin-list#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[Sanders' Top California Staffer Exits Before The Most Important Remaining Primary]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/bernie-sanders-california-state-director-exits-before-most-important-remaining-primary</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Liz Fields for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 21:05:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe parting of ways comes less than a month before the crucial California primary on June 7.\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bernie Sanders]]></category><category><![CDATA[Michael Ceraso]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robert Becker]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Americas]]></category><category><![CDATA[2016 Us Election]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><category><![CDATA[California Primary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Us Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[United States]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/05/11/untitled-article-1462998152.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" length=\"1280\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>Bernie Sanders' top staffer in California, Michael Ceraso, has left the senator's campaign less than a month out from the state's high-stakes primary, where the most delegates of any state this election are up for grabs.</p><p>The Sanders campaign has long used the California contest as an example that the nomination contest is far from over, hopeful that he will capture a large portion of the 475 pledged delegates available on June 7. News of state director Ceraso's <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/bernie-sanders-california-michael-ceraso-223077\">split</a> with the campaign, first reported by <em>Politico</em>, comes at an inopportune time, as Sanders struggles to catch up to rival Hillary Clinton's lead of 276 pledged delegates.</p><p>The circumstances surrounding Ceraso's departure were not immediately clear. Ceraso, who previously helped the campaign earn a key victory in New Hampshire, where he was the campaign's deputy state director, reportedly had pushed the campaign to focus more on its digital strategy in California, rather than television advertising, according to <em>Politico</em>.</p><p>On Monday, Sanders suggested he may not air television advertisements in California at all, telling the the <i>Sacramento Bee</i> that the campaign was in \"reasonably good financial shape, but TV is so expensive here in California, you could just spend millions of dollars in a few days.\"</p><p>The Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request from VICE News for comment on Wednesday. But they wasted no time in announcing a replacement for Ceraso. Robert Becker, who was Sanders' state director in Iowa and worked on the campaigns efforts in numerous other states, including New York, will take the reins in California, a spokesman told <em>Politico</em>.</p><p>Sanders, faced with repeated calls to drop out of the race, has continued to score wins, including in West Virginia on Tuesday by more than 15 percentage points. Despite the ongoing momentum, he has failed to significantly cut into Clinton's delegate advantage in the last month.</p><p>While he has drawn large crowds to his rallies in California, Sanders remains between 2 and 19 points behind in recent polling in the state. The Vermont senator has pledged to see the nomination race right through to the Democratic National Convention in July, and a significant win in California is crucial to the campaign's strategy to tip the scales in his favor.</p><p>Although it is now impossible for Sanders to clinch the nomination through the remaining pledged delegates alone, the campaign has revealed plans to try and convince as many superdelegates as possible to switch their support from Clinton to Sanders. But that is not typically a realistic proposition for a candidate who fails to win either pledged delegates or the popular vote.</p><p><em>Follow Liz Fields on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lianzifields\">@lianzifields</a></em><br></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/bernie-sanders-california-state-director-exits-before-most-important-remaining-primary\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/bernie-sanders-california-state-director-exits-before-most-important-remaining-primary#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[French Rail Company Invests In Elon Musk's Near-Supersonic, Levitating Train Of The Future]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/french-rail-company-invests-in-elon-musks-near-supersonic-levitating-train-of-the-future</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Solenn Sugier for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe new system would see passengers in pods hurtling through pressurized tubes.  \t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><category><![CDATA[France]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sncf]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hyperloop]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hyperloop One]]></category><category><![CDATA[Elon Musk]]></category><category><![CDATA[Capsule]]></category><category><![CDATA[Startup]]></category><category><![CDATA[Vice News France]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[California]]></category><category><![CDATA[San Francisco]]></category><category><![CDATA[Los Angeles]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/05/11/untitled-article-1462994917.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" length=\"640\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>French national railway company SNCF has decided to <a href=\"https://www.afp.com/fr/infos/258/la-sncf-investit-dans-le-projet-de-train-du-futur-hyperloop\">back</a> one of the American startups currently at work on the Hyperloop  a self-powering, high-speed transportation link that could see passengers zipping around low-pressure tubes in levitating, train-like \"capsules.\"</p><p>The Hyperloop is the brainchild of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, best known for giving the world Tesla cars, Paypal, and SpaceX, a company that specializes in launching rockets and spacecraft. Initial plans for the Hyperloop were released in 2013.</p><p>Musk's vision for rail transport involves state of the art trains traveling through low-pressure tubes. The project was first revealed in 2013, when Musk released a 57-page <a href=\"https://www.teslamotors.com/sites/default/files/blog_attachments/hyperloop_alpha3.pdf\">document</a> outlining his vision.</p><p>Powered by the overhead solar panels lining the Hyperloop tubes, Musk's system would see passenger capsules hurtling through the low-pressure tubes at speeds of up to 800 miles per hour. </p><p>Passengers of the Hyperloop  <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/elon-musk-hyperloop-dream-concorde-jets-rail-guns--air-hockey-as-the-future-of-transportation\">described</a> by Musk as a \"cross between a Concorde, a rail gun, and an air-hockey table\"  will be able to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco in just 30 minutes. A commute from Paris to Marseille, which takes just over three hours on an SNCF high-speed train, would shrink to 40 minutes.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/elon-musk-just-unveiled-the-latest-chapter-in-his-secret-master-plan\"><strong>Related: </strong>Elon Musk Just Unveiled the Latest Chapter in His 'Secret Master Plan'</a></p><p>And while Musk has claimed that a Hyperloop fare from LA to San Francisco will set you back a mere <a href=\"http://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/high-tech/20130717.OBS9849/elon-musk-annonce-l-hyperloop-un-moyen-de-transport-revolutionnaire.html\">$20</a>, the cost of making the link operational is expected to reach $6 billion.</p><p>Despite widespread skepticism around the viability of the Hyperloop, the SNCF seems to think the train of the future is more than just a low-pressure pipe dream. </p><p>According to AFP, it is not known how much money the SNCF has invested in the venture. When contacted by VICE News this morning, the rail company declined to comment on its recent investment.</p><p>The SNCF's contribution is part of the $80 million investment secured by LA tech startup Hyperloop One during its second round of financing. </p><p>Meanwhile, Hyperloop One undertook the <a href=\"motherboard%20dersert%20hyperloop%20test\">first test</a> of its system today in the desert outside of Las Vegas. It is not yet known how long the test will last, or how far the prototype will travel.</p><p>In 2015, the company announced that it would soon carry out tests on a one-kilometer track, experimenting with speeds of up to 540 kilometers per hour (335 miles per hour). According to AFP, the company predicted it would then build a full-scale prototype, capable of traveling up to 1,120 kilometers per hour (700 miles per hour) through a three-kilometer (1.9 mile) tube.</p><p>As part of its efforts to bring near-supersonic ground travel to the general public, Hyperloop One has also launched a feasibility study of routes in Finland and Sweden. It's also looking into building a high-speed freight link in Switzerland.</p><p>In November 2015, SNCF President Guillaume Pepy met Hyperloop One's co-founder Brogan Bambrogan at a summit organized by the magazine Challenges. </p><p>\"We must still improve the  of what happens then.\" </p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/teslas-model-3-is-a-no-brainer-for-auto-enthusiasts\"><strong>Related: </strong>Tesla's Model 3 Is a 'No-Brainer' for Auto Enthusiasts</a></p><p>Vidalenc thinks predictions that the train could be up and running in four years are highly exaggerated. Hyperloop Transportation Technologies  the other startup developing Hyperloop technology  has implied the system could be operational by 2020. </p><p>And even if the train does get built, Vidalenc is not sure how useful it will be. A train traveling at near-supersonic speeds, he argues, will only be able to make very limited stops, and will therefore only serve to link major cities. \"It could solve some problems, such as how to get from Paris to Marseille faster. But for other regions, the problems would remain the same, or get worse,\" he said.</p><p><em>Follow Solenn on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/solennsugier\">@SolennSugier</a></em></p><p><em>Follow VICE News France on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vicenewsfr?lang=fr\">@vicenewsFR</a></em></p><p><em><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/fr/article/la-sncf-investit-dans-un-projet-de-train-du-futur?utm_source=vicenewsfrfb\">This article originally appeared in VICE News' French edition.</a></em><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/fr/article/la-sncf-investit-dans-un-projet-de-train-du-futur?utm_source=vicenewsfrfb\"></a></p><p> <em>Drawing of the Hyperloop capsule via <a href=\"https://fr.scribd.com/doc/159911551/hyperloop-alpha-20130812-pdf\">Elon Musk's Hyperloop presentation.</a>  </em><br></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/french-rail-company-invests-in-elon-musks-near-supersonic-levitating-train-of-the-future\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/french-rail-company-invests-in-elon-musks-near-supersonic-levitating-train-of-the-future#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[Ted Cruz, The Most Hated Man In Congress, Has Returned To Washington]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/ted-cruz-the-most-hated-man-in-congress-has-returned-to-washington</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah Mimms for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 20:35:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenators are holding back to see whether the failed presidential candidate alters his tactics in Congress, but Cruz is indicating that nothing will change.\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ted Cruz]]></category><category><![CDATA[2016 Us Election]]></category><category><![CDATA[John Mccain]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lindsey Graham]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mitch Mcconnell]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bob Corker]]></category><category><![CDATA[John Cornyn]]></category><category><![CDATA[John Thune]]></category><category><![CDATA[Us Senate]]></category><category><![CDATA[Us Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[United States]]></category><category><![CDATA[Americas]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/05/11/untitled-article-1462994688.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" length=\"2000\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>After spending more than a year on the campaign trail demonizing Congress and American politicians, Senator Ted Cruz returned to work this week in the US Capitol, the headquarters of what he has dubbed the \"Washington cartel.\"</p><p>Cruz, one of the most hated men in Congress, returned to Washington Tuesday afternoon, where he will have to once again work with colleagues that he repeatedly accused of corruption and getting \"in bed with the lobbyists and special interests\" during his political campaign.</p><p>\"It's great to be back in the warming embrace of Washington,\" Cruz sardonically told reporters in front of his Senate office on Tuesday.</p><p>Cruz skipped a vote in the Senate on Monday, as well as a luncheon with his Republican colleagues Tuesday afternoon, leaving senators eager to discover who is re-joining their ranks. Will it be the Cruz they know  the firebrand Texan who called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a \"liar\" on the Senate floor, who twice went around leadership to try to force a government shutdown (once successfully) and then criticized and questioned their motives across the country during his run for the presidency? Or is it a new Cruz, one chastened by his loss in the presidential race, who will return to his job eager to work with them to get something done?</p><p>Those questions remain unanswered, at least for now. Cruz received uproarious applause from his staff upon his return on Tuesday, but many of his Republican colleagues, including those who have hardly kept their opinions of the senator to themselves in the past, are holding their tongues. </p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/ted-cruz-could-jump-back-into-the-presidential-race-but-itll-take-a-miracle\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related:</strong> Ted Cruz Could Jump Back Into the Presidential Race  But It'll Take a Miracle</a></p><p>There is a palpable sense among Senate Republicans that they would like to avoid kicking a man while he's down, just a week after his presidential hopes expired. But there is also hope that the man they knew and loved to loathe may return humming a new tune.</p><p>\"I think he'll come back and he'll decide how and what role he wants to play in the Senate,\" Senator John Thune, a member of Republican leadership, said Tuesday. </p><p>\"But you know, that's his prerogative,\" Thune added, when asked about the various insults Cruz slung at Washington politicians like himself on the campaign trail this year. \"Every senator approaches this job differently and has different priorities, objectives, and in most cases styles of doing things. He's fresh off the campaign trail, and I assume that when he reenters the Senate, hopefully, he'll plow into Senate work and help us get some things done around here. We'll see if that's the case. And I would hope that it would be.\"</p><p>For Cruz, his first 24 hours back in Washington haven't been too different from his time on the campaign trail. He is still followed by small packs of reporters everywhere he goes, using the word \"Trump\" more often than they use his own name.</p><p>In some ways, Cruz is different. In interviews, it's clear that the toll of the presidential campaign is still weighing on him. When asked about the results in Nebraska on Tuesday night, where Cruz still pulled in nearly 20 percent of the vote a week after he ended his campaign, the Texan grew quiet and a bit emotional.</p><p>\"I am encouraged and gratified by every vote I received and the support across the country. My greatest disappointment in the race,\" he said, pausing and lower his voice, \"is that I fell short and failed to deliver for the millions of grassroots activists who worked so hard  desperately want to change the path we're on.... I'm sorry that I disappointed the conservative grassroots by not being able to prevail.\"</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/londons-muslim-mayor-tells-donald-trump-that-his-offer-sucks\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related:</strong> London's Muslim Mayor Tells Donald Trump That His Offer Sucks</a></p><p>Cruz returned to work with zeal on Wednesday morning, attending a lengthy Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, where he offered amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act, and taking part in two Senate votes.</p><p>\"It is good to be back. I'm rolling up my sleeves and hard at work,\" he told VICE News, as he shuffled between a vote on federal funding for energy and water issues and the committee hearing. \"My priorities on the campaign were jobs, freedom and security. I had hoped to fight for jobs, freedom and security from the White House. Instead, I will continue to fight for those very same priorities here in the Senate because those are the priorities of the American people and we need leaders who are accountable to the American people.\"</p><p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>.]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/ted-cruz-the-most-hated-man-in-congress-has-returned-to-washington\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/ted-cruz-the-most-hated-man-in-congress-has-returned-to-washington#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[Chicken Industry Workers Wear Diapers Because Bosses Allow No Breaks, NGO Says]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/chicken-industry-workers-wear-diapers-because-bosses-allow-no-breaks-ngo-says</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Tess  Owen for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost poultry workers surveyed say that leaving the production line to use the restroom is a privilege, not a right.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Americas]]></category><category><![CDATA[United States]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Poultry Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor]]></category><category><![CDATA[Chickens]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tyson Foods]]></category><category><![CDATA[Perdue Farms]]></category><category><![CDATA[Oxfam America]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exploitation]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/05/11/workers-in-the-chicken-industry-wear-diapers-because-bosses-allow-no-breaks-report-1462996160.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" length=\"2000\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>Americans consume more chicken than ever before  30 percent more than they did just 20 years ago.</p><p>Not only do consumers in the US want chicken, they want it cheap, and in an increasing variety of styles and shapes.

They often end up working long shifts, at breakneck speeds to keep up with American appetites and tastes, with a single half-hour break, all while earning less than $10 an hour. </p><p>The pressure to keep up with the line speed is so great that supervisors routinely deny workers' requests to go to the bathroom, according to a new Oxfam America <a href=\"https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/research-publications/no-relief/\">report</a>, titled <em>No Relief: Denial of Bathroom Breaks in the Poultry Industry.</em></p><p>To avoid the embarrassment of becoming so desperate that they urinate or defecate on the floor, many workers say that they've grown accustomed to wearing diapers while at work. \"I had to wear Pampers,\" one worker told Oxfam. \"I, and many, many others had to wear Pampers.\" </p><p>Different plants and departments have varying rules when it comes to bathroom breaks, but the overall consensus among poultry workers surveyed seems to be that leaving the production line to use the restroom is a privilege, not a right. If a worker need to go, someone has to replace them on the line until they come back. Workers say finding a replacement can take up to an hour. Sometimes, they say, a replacement never arrives.One worker at Pilgrim's plant in Alabama, told Oxfam that the only time he and his hundreds of colleagues were allowed to use the bathroom was during their 30 minute lunch break. In that time, he had to undress from his work gear, eat lunch, line up to use the bathroom and then get back into work gear.</p><p>A 2013 <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/news/2013/03/07/splc-report-exposes-dangers-faced-alabama-poultry-workers\">report</a> conducted by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, called <em>Unsafe at These Speeds: Alabama's Poultry Industry and Its Disposable Workers </em>said some workers reported policies limiting bathroom breaks to five minutes. \"Workers described stripping off their gear while running to the restroom, an embarrassing but necessary action to meet the strict five-minute time limit\" the report said. \"This race to the bathroom is also dangerous because processing plant floors can be slippery with fat, blood, water, and other liquids.\"</p><p>A worker named Susana, who spoke with VICE news on the condition of using a pseudonym, said that her supervisor at the Tyson poultry plant in Arkansas where she works caps bathroom breaks at seven minutes. Susana's job is to clean the chickens which have just been eviscerated. It smells like a combination of chicken blood and bleach, she says. It's also very cold, to protect the machines from overheating.</p><p>Susana was one of the 200 workers affected by a <a href=\"http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/jun/27/chlorine-leak-tyson-plant-hospitalizes-several/?latest\">chlorine gas leak</a> in 2011, and is involved in an ongoing suit against the plant. She has had serious respiratory problems ever since the incident, but says she has to stay at Tyson because they are providing her with medical services, and she has two children who she needs to support. Because of her respiratory complications, she says that it's very difficult to get to the bathroom and back in only seven minutes. She's allowed to take a little more time  because of her health problems  but her colleagues are not afforded the same luxury. </p><p>\"They are told they shouldn't drink a lot of water so they don't need to go to the bathroom,\" Susana said. Many workers surveyed in the report say that they limit their liquid intake to avoid needing to urinate while at work. </p><p>Susanna says that limited bathroom breaks often cause her physical pain. </p><p>\"It's not just  efforts to paint the whole industry with a broad brush based on a handful of anonymous claims,\" the <a href=\"http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/health-safety-and-respect-of-employees-a-top-priority-for-poultry-processors/\">statement</a> said. \"We believe such instances are extremely rare and that US poultry companies work hard to prevent them.\"</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/video-shows-chickens-being-punched-boiled-alive-at-humane-association-approved-farm\"><strong>Related:</strong> Video Shows Chickens Being Punched, Boiled Alive at Humane Association-Approved Farm</a></p><p>\"Coordinating restroom breaks in the workplace is certainly not unique to the chicken industry,\" the NCC added. \"Whether it's a cashier, bus driver, bartender, bank teller, or just about any manufacturing job, there are practices in place related to restroom breaks that are clearly outlined to the employee.\"</p><p>Gary Mickelsen, a spokesperson for Tyson foods, told VICE News in an email that the company was \"concerned about these anonymous claims\" and \"while we currently have no evidence they're true, are checking to make sure our position on restroom breaks is being followed and our Team Members' needs are being met.\" Mickelsen added that representatives from the company have met with Oxfam America in the past to discuss their concerns, and \"told them that while we believe we're a caring responsible company, we're always willing to consider ways we can do better.\" </p><p>\"Protecting and ensuring the health and safety of each and every Pilgrim's team member is core to who we are as a company\" wrote Cameron Bruett from Pilgrim's Pride, adding that employees \"have the opportunity\" to report grievances through a \"dispute resolution process,\" a \"union-negotiated and arbitration process\" or the \"Pride Line\"  a 'real-time, 24 hours a day telephonic reporting system.\"</p><p>Julie DeYoung from Perdue Farms similarly stressed that \"the health and welfare of our associates is paramount and we take these types of<br>allegations very seriously.\" </p><p>\"The anecdotes reported are not consistent with Perdue's policies and practices. Perdue has an Open Door Policy which includes an anonymous toll-free hotline to voice concerns. Our internal review did not find any of these complaints.\"<br>Sanderson Farms declined to comment.<br></p><p>Oxfam say their findings are the result of three years of research, hundreds of interviews with current and former poultry workers, medical experts, and worker advocates, and are in keeping with other studies on the same subject. SPLC for example, surveyed 266 poultry workers in Alabama, and found that 80 percent said they weren't permitted to take bathroom breaks when they needed them.</p><p><br></p><p><br><br><br></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/chicken-industry-workers-wear-diapers-because-bosses-allow-no-breaks-ngo-says\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/chicken-industry-workers-wear-diapers-because-bosses-allow-no-breaks-ngo-says#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[Americans Desperate To Flee Trump Can Hook Up With Canadians On This Site ]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/americans-desperate-to-flee-trump-can-hook-up-with-canadians-on-this-site</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Rachel Browne for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 19:45:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe website is the brainchild of 25-year-old Texan Joe Goldman, who has even signed up himself, hoping to find a Canadian to love.\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Americas]]></category><category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category><category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category><category><![CDATA[Presidency]]></category><category><![CDATA[President]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><category><![CDATA[Us]]></category><category><![CDATA[2016 Us Election]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Immigration]]></category><category><![CDATA[Republicans]]></category><category><![CDATA[Democrats]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/05/11/untitled-article-1462994683.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" length=\"1500\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>A new website is offering Americans the chance to avoid Donald Trump as President by helping them get hitched to a Canadian.</p><p>\"Make dating great again,\" the Calgary-based MapleMatch.com homepage reads, with a plaid-clad couple overlooking what appears to be a typical Canadian forest. \"Maple Match makes it easy for American to find the ideal Canadian partner to save them from the unfathomable horror of a Trump presidency.\"</p><p>The site's CEO Joe Goldman, a 25-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/10/maple-match-dating-service-americans-canada-trump?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Gmail\">entrepreneur</a> from Texas, assured Calgary radio show <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/eyeopener/\">The Eyeopener</a> on Tuesday that his site, and the pending mobile app, is legitimate. </p><p>\"Absolutely this is serious,\" he said. \"The 49th parallel is just a line and Americans and Canadians have so much in common ...

After Super Tuesday, searches on Google for \"move to Canada\" skyrocketed 1,500 percent. Recent polls are finding that around 60 percent of Americans dislike Trump, who continues to face criticism for his behavior on social media and other controversy in real life, while also dominating media coverage of the presidential race. </p><p>An Ipsos poll <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2569893/19-of-americans-would-consider-moving-to-canada-if-trump-becomes-u-s-president-ipsos-poll/\">for Global News</a> from March found nearly 20 percent of Americans would consider moving to Canada if Trump becomes President, with 28 percent of people from 18 years old to 34 saying they'd move. That same poll also found that 15 percent would move if Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton becomes President.</p><p>Earlier this year a Canadian radio host Rob Calabrese created a website, with almost 1 million visitors, inviting anti-Trump Americans to seek refuge in Nova Scotia.</p><p>\"Donald Trump may become the President! If that happens, and you decide to get the hell out of there, might I suggest moving to Cape Breton Island!\" the site stated. </p><p>Calabrese told reporters at the time he had received a deluge of messages from Americans considering it.

Meanwhile, the party of Vice President Michel Temer, set to replace Rousseff if she is suspended to face trial, began running photos of the vice president with captions reading \"Today is the day\" and \"It won't be long until Brazil is united under a government that is free of spite and hate.\"</p><p>With the voting expected to get underway soon, there was little to suggest anything would stop Rousseff from being forced into suspension while facing trial  the biggest turn yet in what has been a surreal political crisis for South America's most populous nation.<br></p><p>\"Brazil is in a situation that is not, in any way, enviable,\" said Alexander Barros, a political science professor and founder of the political consulting firm Early Alert. \"You have an accumulation of crises that I don't ever remember having seen in a democratic Brazil, and a political system that is simply not equipped to react.\"</p><p>Less than two years ago, Rousseff was elected with 54 million votes in a narrow victory over her nearest rival. Today, the country is suffering its worst economic recession since the 1930s. A whopping 318 of the 594 members of the lower house are being investigated for serious crimes or even facing charges, while the same is true of 49 of the 81 senate members.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/impeachment-brazil-dilma-rousseff-inevitable-lower-house\"><strong>Related: </strong>The Impeachment of Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff Now Seems All but Inevitable</a><br></p><p>\"Wednesday is D-day for Brazil,\" said Barros. \"After that vote, we'll see what happens, but at this point, no one can really be certain.\"</p><p>The 68-year-old Rousseff's political story was already remarkable. </p><p>Born the daughter of an immigrant from Bulgaria in the large and industrial city of Belo Horizonte, the young Rousseff joined the armed struggle against the military dictatorship installed by a coup in 1964. During her time in the guerrilla she was tortured and imprisoned between 1970 and 1972. </p><p>When she was released, thin and ill, Rousseff returned home and eventually moved to Rio Grande do Sul to study economics and found the Democratic Labor Party with then husband Carlos Arajo. It was years later, in 2001, that she joined the Worker's Party as part of ex-president Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva's team, eventually becoming his Minister of Energy. </p><p>Rousseff then became the first woman president of Brazil in 2010 with Lula's backing. Although she embraced many of his political projects, her style was much more confrontational. She also pushed for many of Lula's projects to be implemented more quickly. </p><p>\"In order to accelerate the pace of<em> Lulismo</em>, Dilma poked jaguars with short sticks,\" wrote political scientist Andre Singer, alluding to behavior some congressmen complained was pushy. </p><p>According to Singer, such provocations, coupled with policies that business groups saw to be anti-developmentalist  such as strict labor laws requiring comprehensive benefits to workers  would make it harder for her to navigate the troubles to come, such as a major economic downturn. </p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/millions-of-brazilians-hate-all-politicians-but-they-love-this-anti-corruption-judge\"><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Related: </strong>Millions of Brazilians Hate All Politicians, but They Love This Anti-Corruption Judge</a><br></p><p>Flavio Britto, an expert of electoral law at the University of Brasilia, also suggests Rousseff's reluctance to seek dialogue led her opponents in the legislature to promote impeachment as the solution to the country's economic woes. </p><p>\"The president stood up to an aggressive and arrogant Congress, and that brought consequences,\" Britto said. \"Including the beginning of this  process.\"</p><p>Although the impeachment itself is focused on the intricacies of acceptable accounting methods, the political crisis surrounding the probable removal of Rousseff is intimately associated with a landmark graft investigation that has shaken up the entire Brazilian political class. </p><p>The investigation  dubbed the<em> Lava Jato</em>, or Car Wash  began as a probe into allegations that politicians received kickbacks in exchange for inflated contracts given out by state-run oil company Petrobras. Over the past two years, the probe ballooned into a sweeping corruption investigation that has jailed members of Brazil's highest political and social echelons.</p><p>While Rousseff has not been named in the investigation, she was Minister of Energy at the time the corruption was allegedly taking place. And while all major parties have been implicated in the scheme, the governing Workers' Party cannot hide from the fact that it was in the driver's seat. </p><p><em>Lava Jato</em> has consequently never been far away from the debate over an impeachment process that, after countless turns and falls along the way, began to seem near inevitable after the lower house voted overwhelmingly in favor of her ouster on April 17.</p><p>The plots twists, however, have continued almost right up to the vote.</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/in-stunning-twist-brazils-lower-house-acting-speaker-annuls-rousseff-impeachment\"><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Related:</strong> In Stunning Twist, Brazil's Lower House Acting Speaker Annuls Rousseff Impeachment</a><br></p><p>Last Thursday, the supreme court ordered Eduardo Cunha to step down as president of the lower house, where he had promoted the impeachment process. The decision to remove him came 142 days after the country's attorney general requested he be dismissed on the grounds that he had used his position in \"an illicit manner\" to prevent investigations against him from moving forward.</p><p>Cunha is implicated in the <em>Lava Jato</em> probe, with the supreme court opening an investigation into allegations of corruption and money laundering against him in March. Last week's ruling, written by minister Teori Zavascki, said Cunha's removal as president of the lower house was necessary in order to \"ensure that we have a republic for the common people, not a community of untouchables.\"</p><p>Cunha, whose position as a legislator has not been affected, claimed that he was the victim of retaliation for his role in impeachment proceedings. Others, however, accuse the supreme court of dragging its feet in a way that allowed him to push impeachment forward.</p><p>Political scientist Paulo Nascimento of the University of Brasilia, doubts the removal of Cunha at an earlier time would have impacted the lower house vote last month. He stresses that many legislators who supported Rousseff's impeachment are also enemies of Cunha.</p><p>\"Without him, the process would have certainly been slower,\" Nascimento said. \"But I think the mood in the chamber was in favor of impeachment, and he simply facilitated that process.\"</p><p>Probably the biggest surprise, however, came when Cunha's replacement suddenly announced he would be annulling that lower house vote  with just 48 hours to go before today's senate vote. </p><p>Waldir Maranho's announcement sent the media into a frenzy until senate president, Renan Calheiros, said he would go ahead as planned and Maranho backtracked. Nascimento believes it was little more than a failed strategy aimed at halting the impeachment process possibly negotiated by Maranho in exchange for the promise of a position in the senate.</p><p>Meanwhile, as the impeachment process against Rousseff has gathered steam so too have Vice President Temer's preparations for taking over.</p><p>A constitutional lawyer who has not previously tended to look for the spotlight himself, Temer has already made it clear he is planning to move the country to the right as he seeks to guide the country out of economic crisis.<br></p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/brazil-set-to-lurch-right-president-rousseff-impeachment\"><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Related:</strong> President Rousseff's Likely Impeachment Will Push Brazil to the Right</a><br></p><p>His strategy to deal with deep-rooted problems of corruption and institutional incompetence, however, are not so clear. </p><p>But, for today at least, all eyes are on Dilma Rousseff.</p><p>\"What is certain is that the legacy of Dilma will not be a positive one at this point,\" said Nascimento.

As the reforms took hold, however, things were growing progressively worse for the Rohingya, a heavily persecuted ethnic Muslim minority concentrated in the country's western state of Rakhine. </p><p>The 2012 gang rape and murder of a Buddhist woman by three Muslim men ignited violent riots in which hundreds were killed as Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya attacked each other. In the following months, tens of thousands of Rohingya were rounded up and forced to live in squalid camps; Human Rights Watch deemed the attacks crimes against humanity that amounted to ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya. Thousands of Rohingya have since attempted to leave the country, fueling the region's intricate and brutal human trafficking network. </p><p>In the final part of our three-part series, VICE News correspondent Danny Gold reveals leaked internal UN documents that suggest an effort to keep concerns about the Rohingya quiet, and speaks to a former UN human rights officer about the organization's passive response to the situation in Myanmar.</p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/video/is-the-un-failing-the-rohingya-left-for-dead-part-3\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/video/is-the-un-failing-the-rohingya-left-for-dead-part-3#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[A Drunken Escapade By Bros In Death Valley May Have Killed A Tiny Endangered Fish]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/a-drunken-escapade-by-bros-in-death-valley-may-have-killed-a-tiny-endangered-fish</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Smith for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 17:25:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShotgun-wielding intruders may have been responsible for the death of an endangered fish during a drunken escapade in Death Valley National Park.\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Endangered Species]]></category><category><![CDATA[Death Valley]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nevada]]></category><category><![CDATA[Intoxication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Devils Hole Pulpfish]]></category><category><![CDATA[Center For Biological Diversity]]></category><category><![CDATA[National Parks Service]]></category><category><![CDATA[Americas]]></category><category><![CDATA[United States]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/05/11/untitled-article-1462982103.png\" type=\"image/png\" length=\"752\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>The shotgun-slinging, beer-fueled bros who federal authorities say trashed the only home of an endangered fish at Death Valley National Park could find themselves hauled up in front of a judge before long.</p><p>Apparently unfamiliar or uninterested in the naturalist's code of \"take only photos, leave only footprints,\" the men are suspected of taking the life of a Devils Hole pupfish and leaving behind beer cans, a pair of boxer shorts, and a puddle of vomit after an April 30 romp.</p><p>\"Devils Hole pupfish have been teetering on the brink of extinction for years.

On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will visit the devastated city to assess the damage and discuss the federal government's involvement in recovery efforts.</p><p>\"We think we got this thing beat in McMurray. We're looking pretty good,\" the region's fire chief Darby Allen <a href=\"http://www.fortmcmurraytoday.com/2016/05/11/youll-see-all-of-us-standing-very-much-shoulder-to-shoulder-oilsands-energy-executive-tells-alberta\">told reporters</a> Tuesday evening. </p><p>More than 1,500 firefighters have been battling the blaze, with the <a href=\"http://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=41701E7ECBE35-AD48-5793-1642C499FF0DE4CF\">help </a>of 150 helicopters, and 28 air tankers. </p><p>Allen added that residents still won't be allowed in until it's completely safe. Even though slightly cooler temperatures and humidity have assisted firefighting efforts, the fire has <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/the-fort-mcmurray-disaster-read-the-latest-tuesday/article29930041/\">spread</a> to 229,000 hectares after two fires near Fort McMurray joined together. A province-wide ban on open fires remains.</p><p>\"We gotta check the electricity, water, all that stuff, so we will get you back as soon as we can, we promise,\" Allen said.</p><p>But, it's unclear exactly when residents will be able to return  and in the meantime, universities and social housing agencies have <a href=\"https://uofa.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2016/may/ualberta-response-to-fort-mcmurray-fire\">offered</a> longer-term accommodations for evacuees, while schools in Edmonton have opened their doors to children displaced from their classrooms. There are 13 evacuation centers open across the province.</p><p>During a guided media tour of the city on Monday, the government said that 80 to 90 percent of the city remained intact, but 2,400 structures have been burned to the ground.</p><p>On Tuesday, Alberta premier Rachel Notley <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/notley-stands-with-oilsands-executives-production-to-resume-no-layoffs/\">met with</a> executives from pipeline, oil sands and energy companies to discuss the future of the industry, which is expected to soon get back on its feet before the city of Fort McMurray itself. </p><blockquote>'We think we got this thing beat in McMurray. '</blockquote><p>\"This is an important step in the recovery of our people,\" Notley <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/05/10/fort-mcmurray-residents-to-wait-2-weeks-for-plan-to-return.html\">said</a> during a press conference following the meeting. \"We expect ultimately that many companies will begin to resume their production in the coming days and short weeks ahead.\" No pipelines were damaged by the fire, Notley continued. </p><p>According to the CEO of Suncor, no layoffs are planned for the company.</p><p>Shell restarted production earlier this week, but has been losing around $65 million in revenue per day after it was forced to shut down six operations.</p><p>The Red Cross is expected to announce on Wednesday how it will distribute the $60 million it has received in donations. And the provincial government will also discuss its plan to distribute debit cards  with around $1,250 per adult and $500 for each child or dependant  to evacuees. </p><p>On Tuesday, Trudeau<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-fort-mcmurray-fire-friday-1.3575607\"> told</a> the House of Commons he would be visiting Fort McMurray on Friday to survey the destruction. He pledged the federal government would match all individual donations to the Red Cross.</p><p>\" congratulate the brave firefighters and first responders who have been there to do extraordinary work through these terrible blazes,\" said Trudeau. \"I want to congratulate all Canadians who across the country came together to give incredibly generously to the people of Fort McMurray.\"</p><p><em>Follow Rachel Browne on Twitter:</em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rp_browne\">@rp_browne</a></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/canadian-oil-companies-start-work-again-around-fire-ravaged-fort-mcmurray\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/canadian-oil-companies-start-work-again-around-fire-ravaged-fort-mcmurray#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title><![CDATA[A Stolen Generation: Investigating The Tragedy Of Nigeria\u2019s Missing Children]]></title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<link>https://news.vice.com/article/a-stolen-generation-investigating-the-tragedy-of-nigerias-missing-children</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Sally  Hayden for VICE News]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 15:50:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVICE News visited northeast Nigeria where thousands of children have completely disappeared, with their fates undocumented and their parents uncertain if they'd even accept them back.\t\t\t\t\t\t]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</description>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nigeria]]></category><category><![CDATA[Africa]]></category><category><![CDATA[Boko Haram]]></category><category><![CDATA[War & Conflict]]></category><category><![CDATA[Abductions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Maiduguri]]></category><category><![CDATA[Borno State]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sambisa Forest]]></category><category><![CDATA[Yola]]></category><category><![CDATA[Adamawa State]]></category>\t\t\t\t<enclosure url=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/04/15/untitled-article-1459881395.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" length=\"1280\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<![CDATA[<p>\"When Boko Haram attacked us in the village everyone was just running helter skelter,\" Saratu Zakaria told VICE News. \"The kids followed their dad but along the way they got lost.\"<br></p><p>Zakaria, 44, is living in a makeshift camp behind a church in Yola, Adamawa State, northeast Nigeria. She's missing four children: three girls and one boy aged 7, 8, 10, and 16. It's been one year and six months since she saw them.</p><p>\"There's a place where we normally went to hide, it was like a refuge point for all of us in the village, but the bad guys came to that very spot and they abducted everybody,\" Zakaria recalled. \"A lot of us that are alive today escaped to Cameroon, and from Cameroon they brought us back to Nigeria.\"</p><p>Large numbers of her neighbors were massacred during the assault. \"In my presence a lot of women were slaughtered   these are the main problems. The main problem is hunger.\"</p><p>Another boy said: \"Food was three times, breakfast, lunch, supper. The food was not enough. There was very little food.\"</p><p>Mass arrests by the military often target men and boys based on their age and profile, rather than because of any proof of guilt. Media reports and witness statements suggest that 162 children have been released from military custody since July 2015, but their time incarcerated can also have longer lasting impacts. These include being the risk of being rejected by their communities due to suspicions that they're supportive of Boko Haram or have some links to the group.</p><p>Other NGO workers, who didn't want to be named, also raised concerns to VICE News about the screening processes that often-traumatized children are put through after they are \"rescued\" by the military, saying the emphasis isn't on family reunification or other care but rather on ascertaining their level of guilt.</p><p>* * *</p><p>While VICE News heard <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/how-i-escaped-boko-haram-one-womans-story\" target=\"_blank\">many</a> heroic <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/boko-harams-war-on-women-abductees-speak-of-systematic-rape-suicide-bombers-and-survival\" target=\"_blank\">stories</a> from mothers like Zakaria who risked their lives during the conflict to save their children, a lot of the estranged fathers were notably more wary about saying they'd welcome back those missing, particularly if they had been taken by Boko Haram.</p><p>\"Yes, we'd take them back, we'd rejoice,\" one of the 10 men in Yola told VICE News, explaining that this was primarily because their offspring were very young when they were kidnapped.</p><p>However, that group also all agreed that if their children had \"matured\" and gone through forced conversions to Islam or become involved with Boko Haram activities they wouldn't be as accepting.</p><p class=\"has-image\"><img src=\"http://news-images.vice.com/images/2016/04/05/untitled-article-1459881395-body-image-1459883070.jpg?resize=1220:*&output-quality=75\" data-original-width=\"1280px\" data-original-height=\"853px\" style=\"\" /></p><p class=\"photo-credit\">An IDP child sleeps in a makeshift home in a half-finished building at the Wuro-Ahi settlement in Fufore, Adawama State, Nigeria.

He hasn't seen them in two years.</p><p>Speaking in Yola's St. Theresa camp, where 1,000 displaced people are sheltering in the grounds of a Christian church, Thuma said he wasn't going to go searching for his family. \"I wouldn't dare going back, it's risky,\" he said. \"Even me, it took the grace of God for me to survive.</p><p>\"I don't know if my children are alive or...\" his sentence trailed off. \"I wouldn't know if they are alive or used for something else,\" he said after another pause.</p><p>Thuma then articulated a similar opinion to many of other fathers in the northeast: he would be wary in welcoming his offspring into his life again. \"If they're practicing another religion other than Christianity I don't want to have them back,\" he said, \"but if they're willing to be Christians I will.\"</p><p class=\"read-more\"><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/boko-harams-war-on-women-abductees-speak-of-systematic-rape-suicide-bombers-and-survival\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Related: </strong>Boko Haram's War on Women: Abductees Speak of Systematic Rape, Suicide </a><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/boko-harams-war-on-women-abductees-speak-of-systematic-rape-suicide-bombers-and-survival\">Bombers, and Survival</a><br></p><p><em>Follow Sally Hayden on Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/sallyhayd\" target=\"_blank\"><em>@sallyhayd</em></a></p>]]>\n\t\t\t\t\t</content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/a-stolen-generation-investigating-the-tragedy-of-nigerias-missing-children\t\t\t\t\t</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<comments>\n\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://news.vice.com/article/a-stolen-generation-investigating-the-tragedy-of-nigerias-missing-children#disqus_thread\n \t\t\t\t\t</comments>\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n\n\t</rss>\n",
