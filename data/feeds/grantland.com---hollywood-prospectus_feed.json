It doesn&#8217;t find a new angle from which to approach a star who&#8217;s been eclipsed by a persona, the way Green did with Nicolas Cage in 2013&#8217;s <i>Joe </i>and Al Pacino in 2014&#8217;s <i>Manglehorn</i>. It just succumbs to Bullock&#8217;s gravitational pull, content to watch her play a medley of her greatest hits &#8212; funny, relatable klutz; recovering alcoholic; problem-solving tough broad; and (eventually) white savior &#8212; as a limp political satire unfolds around her. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve watched a David Gordon Green movie and found myself wishing I was in the capable hands of a set-&#8217;em-up-knock-&#8217;em-down director like Jay Roach.</p>\n<p>The story is suggested by true events, and by a better movie about those events. In 2002, the Bolivian politician Gonzalo &#8220;Goni&#8221; S\u00e1nchez de Lozada, who&#8217;d served as president of Bolivia from 1993 to 1997, ran for the same office again, this time with the American political consulting firm Greenberg Carville Shrum in his corner. In writer-director Rachel Boynton&#8217;s terrific 2005 documentary, also called <i>Our Brand Is Crisis</i>, we watch as GCS uses crafty American-style politics to get Goni, initially a nonstarter as a candidate, elected with a narrow 22.46 percent plurality. He doesn&#8217;t really have the support of the Bolivian people, including the country&#8217;s deeply disenfranchised indigenous majority, and when he makes the unpopular decision to begin piping Bolivia&#8217;s natural-gas resources to Mexico and California through Chile, the population rises up in anger. Protesters clash with Bolivia&#8217;s police and armed forces, and by the time de Lozada resigns and flees to the United States in October 2003, at least 70 people have been killed, most of them civilians.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a movie about smart people doing deeply cynical things in service of an ostensibly idealistic goal. As head pollster and strategist Jeremy Rosner explains early on, GCS is all about &#8220;progressive policy for profit,&#8221; which means swinging elections in favor of vaguely Clintonesque pro-globalization candidates on the debatable principle that any country&#8217;s poorest people always benefit when the free-market guy wins. The most compelling character in Boynton&#8217;s film is James Carville, blazingly telegenic as always, the life of the party in every meeting, selling cracker wisdom like magic beans, as unconcerned with the specifics of Bolivian politics and history as a coked-up lead singer asking a Cleveland crowd if Cincinnati is ready to rock. But the movie&#8217;s spine is an interview with Rosner, who Boynton walks slowly but surely toward something resembling a confession \u2014 that by twisting the campaign away from actual issues and swinging the election for a marginal candidate who lacked popular support, GCS was at least partially responsible for the chaos and death that followed. Ever the strategist, Rosner expresses his regret in a chagrined yet perfectly noncommittal sound bite: &#8220;It&#8217;s not facts I learned, but the texture of people&#8217;s political passions, and the texture of their sadness about what&#8217;s been stripped from them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In Green&#8217;s <i>Our Brand</i> adaptation, Bullock is &#8220;Calamity&#8221; Jane Bodine, a burned-out campaign-trail veteran who comes off the bench to settle a score with her old nemesis, a cheerfully despicable Carville manqu\u00e9 named Pat Candy, played by Billy Bob Thornton. We know that Jane is a once-great political strategist who fell from grace because the implausible newspaper headlines in the opening credits (&#8220;INCUMBENT LOSS ATTRIBUTED TO JANE BODINE&#8221;) tell us so; we know she has no family and no life and hasn&#8217;t run a campaign in six years because when campaign managers Anthony Mackie and Ann Dowd drive out to her snowy mountain cabin to pull her back into the game, they keep saying things like &#8220;She has no kids, no family, no life&#8221; and &#8220;Six years? She hasn&#8217;t run a campaign in six years?&#8221; The worst thing about this movie isn&#8217;t the fuzziness of its politics; it&#8217;s that it assembles pretty much the best supporting cast you could ask for &#8212; from Dowd and Mackie to Scoot McNairy and Zoe Kazan &#8212; and gives them nothing to do but stand around in conference rooms asking dumb questions for the audience&#8217;s benefit. &#8220;This thing with Candy,&#8221; McNairy&#8217;s adman character says at one point. &#8220;It&#8217;s like they got some Sicilian blood feud going on. Did they used to work together?&#8221;</p>\n<p>You will maybe not be surprised to learn that Jane and Candy do have a history, and that it&#8217;s connected to Jane&#8217;s amoral disengagement from the ideological side of the political game. The tension between them doesn&#8217;t play, because Thornton and Bullock never seem to be on the same page performance-wise; watching them cycle through emotions in their scenes together is like watching two slot machines try to ring cherries. Apart from a thudding moment in which Mackie&#8217;s character establishes his idealistic streak by admitting that he spent time in a Buddhist monastery years ago &#8212; and McNairy&#8217;s perfect creative-class-douchebag wardrobe notwithstanding &#8212; you never really get a sense of who these characters are, professionally or as people. If they&#8217;re experienced enough to get jobs running a presidential campaign in a large Latin American country, they should probably be at least somewhat capable, but the movie&#8217;s arc requires them to be thumb-sucking babies about modern politics, so that Bullock, who drives the narrative, has no choice but to rediscover her inner shark and start running shit. The problem with building the story this way is that the point it&#8217;s trying to make about the morality of American consultants exporting U.S.-style campaigning (and American ideology) to foreign nations is at odds with our desire as an audience to see Bullock and the good guys beat creepy old bald Billy Bob Thornton and deliver a win for their <em>faux</em>-Goni candidate, played by the great Joaquim de Almeida (<i>Fast Five</i>).</p>\n<p>It won&#8217;t win anything, but the best movie I&#8217;ve seen this Oscar season is Denis Villenueve&#8217;s <i>Sicario</i>, another movie about an idealistic female protagonist facing the dawning realization that she&#8217;s complicit in making the world worse. <i>Our Brand </i>is essentially <i>Sicario </i>with a happier ending, in which the cynical Jane&#8217;s decision to do one right thing is imbued with the power to zero out her moral ledger &#8212; partly because the credits roll before the bloodshed starts.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=303652&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/ourbrandiscrisis-e1446217214403.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/ourbrandiscrisis-e1446217214403.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">ourbrandiscrisis</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1d98326d31cba8316f4e5acca6f1a6fb?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">marklisanti</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>50 Scenes That Do Not Appear in the Fox \u2018X-Files\u2019 Revival</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/fifty-scenes-x-files-revival-fox-david-duchovny-gillian-anderson-fox-mulder-dana-scully/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 15:38:45 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Brian Phillips]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grantland.com/?post_type=grantland_pop&#038;p=303603</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A spoiler-free take on the return of the beloved sci-fi series!<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=303603&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People are often surprised to learn that I, Brian Phillips, enjoy spending time with celebrities in glamorous situations and environments. &#8220;But Brian,&#8221; they exclaim, eyes wide over the straws of their Frappuccinos, &#8220;you&#8217;re a <a href=\"http://grantland.com/the-triangle/today-in-twitter-beefs-andy-murrays-mom-vs-yoko-ono/\" target=\"_blank\">serious writer</a>! How can you waste your time with all that trash?&#8221;</p>\n<p>My answer is always the same. &#8220;Look,&#8221; I say with a small smile, &#8220;if Thomas Mann could write <em>Doctor Faustus </em>in Pacific Palisades without even getting a suntan, there&#8217;s no reason I can&#8217;t &#8230; <em>something something something.</em>&#8221; I sort of murmur the last part into my drink. That&#8217;s a trick I picked up from Kirsten Dunst.</p>\n<p>Case in point: Last night I went to a screening of the new <em>X-Files </em>series at The London, an exclusive Hollywood hotel. Glen Morgan was there. Glen Morgan is a little guy I like to call &#8220;a producer of <em>The X-Files</em>, a television series that aired on Fox between 1993 and 2002, starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.&#8221; Actually, he&#8217;s not little at all. Not huge, but he has some mass on him. If I had to use one word to describe Glen Morgan&#8217;s physical scale, it would be &#8220;medium.&#8221; There are a lot of different sizes of people in the world, and that guy is one of the normal ones.</p>\n<p>Afterward, there were cocktails.</p>\n<p>Say what you will about Hollywood, but it was a fascinating experience. My <a href=\"http://grantland.com/features/rob-ford-sports-fan/\" target=\"_blank\">serious-writer brain</a> was fully engaged with learning about things like the meaning of America and also what is up with Mulder and Scully these days. In the most important and deepest sense, I know both, now. I would love to share this knowledge with you. However, I cannot. Because of spoilers. Ever since George R.R. Martin let slip to me in confidence that Tyrion murders Daenerys at the end of the last book, I have been terrified of accidentally revealing a major spoiler on the Internet. Also, the PR flack who welcomed me to the screening room explained that she would &#8220;fucking cut [me]&#8221; if I &#8220;breathe[d] a word about any of this, you [extremely handsome man].&#8221;</p>\n<p>Like I said, I love hanging out with celebrities.</p>\n<p>What I <em>can </em>tell you is what <em>doesn&#8217;t </em>happen in the new <em>X-Files. </em>So much stuff doesn&#8217;t happen! And each new non-development is more shocking than the last. Without further ado, here&#8217;s a breakdown of the most exciting <em>X-Files </em>plot developments that do not and never will exist.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"1\" href=\"#fn-1\"><sup id=\"ss-1\">1</sup></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u2666\u2666\u2666</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_303681\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-303681\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/mulder.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in New York in October 2015.\"   /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span>Rommel Demano/WireImage</span> David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in New York in October 2013.</p></div>\n<p><strong>1. </strong>Mulder does not ask for another caipirinha and then say, &#8220;Heh. I like that word. <em>Caipirinha</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>2. </strong>The Cigarette Smoking Man never sits up grumpily in bed while snapping, &#8220;Jesus, Velazquez, when is it <em>not </em>time to take out the recycling?&#8221; to the alien lying there next to him.</p>\n<p><strong>3. </strong>Scully absolutely does not order some trays on the Internet.</p>\n<p><strong>4. </strong>At the end of a dark alley, where the light from a lone streetlamp gleams along pavement slick with rain, Scully does not find a pop-up taqueria where this guy Jonathan is making churros.</p>\n<p><strong>5. </strong>I could tell you that this series explores the politics of mulch production, but I would be lying, because that is yet another thing that does not happen.</p>\n<p><strong>6. </strong>Mulder does not stare out a window at the U.S. Capitol building and whisper, &#8220;Monsters, huh. I don&#8217;t think I get it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>7. </strong>You know who else doesn&#8217;t do that? Anyone.</p>\n<p><strong>8. </strong>Mulder simply never books a trip to Africa on the grounds that &#8220;hippos just <em>feel </em>like an X-File.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>9. </strong>It does not, at any point, transpire that Assistant FBI Director Walter Skinner joins Kickstarter to seek funding for his &#8220;elegantly bound novelization&#8221; of Infocom&#8217;s <em>Leather Goddesses of Phobos.</em></p>\n<p><strong>10. </strong>The word &#8220;copyleft&#8221; \u2014 that doesn&#8217;t get thrown around a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>11. </strong>Jonathan, who is not making churros, does not tell Scully that &#8220;it&#8217;s about the cinnamon&#8221; and then gasp, &#8220;I&#8217;ve said too much,&#8221; and then get shot in the head by a sniper from Venus.</p>\n<p><strong>12. </strong>Mulder and Scully do not then stumble upon a mysterious low white building in the middle of a cinnamon field where blank-faced workers in white hazmat suits kind of seem like they&#8217;re processing cinnamon but also kind of seem like they&#8217;re doing something else.</p>\n<p><strong>13. </strong>Deep Throat does not come back from the dead and holler, &#8220;Surprise, friends! It&#8217;s me, Deep Throat!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>14. </strong>There is never a day, in the entire timeline of the new series, when the members of the conspiracy openly confess that they would make a shitty water polo team.</p>\n<p><strong>15. </strong>Maybe you&#8217;ve read speculation in online forums that Scully&#8217;s apartment seems a little light on trays. I don&#8217;t know what to tell you; she doesn&#8217;t buy any new ones.</p>\n<p><strong>16. </strong>The camera does not slowly zoom in on the cancer-eating mutant, Leonard Betts, as he takes a long, luxuriant lick of a Friendly&#8217;s ice cream cone, then continue to zoom in, closer and closer, all the way into his mad, dead eyes, as he murmurs, &#8220;This tastes gross.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>17. </strong>&#8220;That&#8217;s right: I said ice cream tastes gross compared with cancer,&#8221; Betts does not add. &#8220;Rest your mouth on <em>that</em>, ice cream Twitter.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>18. </strong>Mulder does not throw a football through a tire swing in extreme slow motion while a gravelly, no-nonsense male voice-over breaks down his mechanics.</p>\n<p><strong>19. </strong>I don&#8217;t want to get overly specific about how Scully&#8217;s Java classes are going, but suffice it to say that she isn&#8217;t taking any.</p>\n<p><strong>20. </strong>Scully&#8217;s daughter Emily died in Season 5. In the new series, Emily does not go to prom, she does not comically juggle two dates, and her two dates are not uptight gentlemen twins portrayed by Kelsey Grammer.</p>\n<p><strong>21. </strong>&#8220;Screw UFOs,&#8221; the Cigarette Smoking Man does not say on a speedboat. Then he <em>really </em>does not sweep his fingers through his hair and cry, &#8220;I have leonine tresses!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>22. </strong>Scully does not text her friend Allison that the Cigarette Smoking Man is &#8220;kind of a fuckboy tbqh.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>23. </strong>Fine, let&#8217;s talk about vaping. I shouldn&#8217;t, but I know you have questions. I&#8217;m not saying Smezznor, the alien overlord of the Milky Way created when Samantha Mulder&#8217;s genes were spliced into Alex Krycek, does not vape. I <em>am </em>saying that Smezznor the compulsively vaping galaxy-king is a stupid idea and that he does not exist.</p>\n<p><strong>24. </strong>The cinnamon-conspiracy trail does not lead Mulder and Scully to a bombed-out mosque in Tangier, where Mulder does not take a break from the investigation to loudly rap all the verses to Big Sean&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z4OU_Ux0IU\" target=\"_blank\">Dance (A$$)</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>25. </strong>So many fans of the show are wondering what became of beloved <em>X-Files </em>mainstay Peggy Little, Skinner&#8217;s long-suffering secretary. I&#8217;m kidding. In fact no one is wondering that, because there is no such character.</p>\n<p><strong>26. </strong>&#8220;Did you see this, Mulder?&#8221; Scully does not whisper while pressing play on the latest YouTube video about a funny octopus. &#8220;This octopus is <em>frightening </em>me.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>27.</strong><em> If </em>Scully dates a Muppet \u2014 I&#8217;m saying <em>if </em>here \u2014 and <em>if </em>that Muppet is Dr. Teeth, their third date is not to the international aikido championships.</p>\n<p><strong>28. </strong>Alfred Hitchcock directs no episodes (Alfred Hitchcock is dead).</p>\n<p><strong>29. </strong>No one, including Luther Lee Boggs, the serial killer who terrorized Scully in the classic episode &#8220;Beyond the Sea,&#8221; gives Scully some trays as a present.</p>\n<p><strong>30. </strong>Mulder&#8217;s book club does not read <em>The Time Traveler&#8217;s Wife</em> \u2014 or if it does, Mulder does not finish the novel.</p>\n<p><strong>31. </strong>Did you know that Grantland has interns? We do, and they&#8217;re doing a fantastic job. Hi, guys! Just not fantastic enough for any of them to appear in <em>The X-Files</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>32. </strong>Similarly, your own mom does not portray former FBI Special Agent Dana Scully, the co-protagonist of the series.

For everybody else: The six-hour sojourn is composed mainly of depressed industrial towns, rust-colored grain fields, and Kwik Trips populated by hard-eyed individuals looking to numb the pain of daily existence with Big Gulp-size sodas and fistfuls of beef jerky. But that\u2019s not how it looks to James Alex. To him, this patch of freeway might as well be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdhkaPZtQF4\" target=\"_blank\">Thunder Road</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4rr0YvKLu8\" target=\"_blank\">Fire\u2019s Highway</a>, or the street where Paul Westerberg wanted to meet before peeling out in \u201cI Will Dare.\u201d For Alex, this is the journey of his dreams.</p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m just cartwheeling through this tour. It&#8217;s awesome,&#8221; Alex tells me. I\u2019ve just reached him by phone at a roadside restaurant in Kenosha. It\u2019s early September, and Alex\u2019s band \u2014 a relentlessly upbeat punk-rock quartet from Philadelphia called Beach Slang \u2014 is in the midst of a short run of dates in support of Tommy Stinson, the bass player from the Replacements, one of Alex\u2019s all-time favorite bands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m flipping out,\u201d he says, in a tone that immediately conveys a person who is indeed flipping the fuck out. \u201cThrilled beyond explanation, right? It&#8217;s like \u2014 it feels surreal, you know? In the best way something can feel surreal.\u201d</p>\n<p>What\u2019s causing Alex to flip out at this very moment is his first trip to the Twin Cities, the Replacements\u2019s home base, where Beach Slang will wrap up this short run in a few days. Alex is already plotting a local tour of noteworthy sites \u2014 the <em>Let It Be </em>house, scattered clubs where the \u2019Mats played, a set of train tracks where some publicity shots were staged. Later, I recommend checking out the CC Club, the dive bar in south Minneapolis that inspired \u201cHere Comes a Regular.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m still absolutely a kid with, like, posters on his wall,\u201d Alex says of his rock and roll obsession. \u201cIt really is the only thing that I&#8217;ve ever subscribed to. I&#8217;m just all in. I assume in the same way if you&#8217;re a history buff and you go to where some famous battle happened, you just know you&#8217;re in this thing where you&#8217;re meant to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>What\u2019s truly surreal lately for Alex is his unlikely success. Formed in the aftermath of Alex\u2019s previous band, Weston, breaking up for good in 2010, Beach Slang started out essentially as a hobby for its 41-year-old frontman. Touring for nearly 20 years with Weston failed to establish anything more than a small cult following, so Alex studied to be a visual artist and bashed out big-hearted rock songs in his spare time. Alex hadn\u2019t given up his rock dreams, but real life required that he compartmentalize them.</p>\n<p>In 2014, Beach Slang put out two seven-inches, <em>Who Would Ever Want Anything So Broken? </em>and <em>Cheap Thrills on a Dead End Street. </em>The reference points were hardly contemporary \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/beach-slang-cheap-thrills-on-a-dead-end-street-tiny-engines-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">Alex has said</a> that he aimed for a sweet spot between \u201cthe Replacements, Swervedriver, Jesus and Mary Chain, all that stuff that I grew up on that affected me.\u201d While recorded on a punk-rock budget, the EPs aspired to the wall-of-guitars production style of \u201990s alt-rock, a huge sound to match the grandiose, borderline corny sentiments of Alex\u2019s lyrics.</p>\n<p>Thematically, Beach Slang slots next to bands like the Hold Steady and Japandroids, which were also formed by indie lifers who didn\u2019t find a wide audience until they were well past the age of 30. Like those bands, Beach Slang makes energetic, aspirational music for aging rock fans looking to reconcile their raucous record collections with the mundane responsibilities of adulthood. But while the Hold Steady and Japandroids grudgingly accept the passage of time \u2014 their songs position youth as a trial by fire that exists in life\u2019s rearview \u2014 Alex still very much relates to the perspective of a teenager.</p>\n<p>Take \u201cFilthy Luck,\u201d the leadoff track from <em>Who Would Ever Want Anything So Broken?, </em>where Alex refers to \u201ckids like <em>us</em>\u201d over fat power chords and hyperactive drum beats. \u201cCarve your name soft across my lungs / I want to breathe you until I\u2019m numb,\u201d he sings, clinging to the present tense in spite of the lyric\u2019s youthful naivety.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat&#8217;s still the person I am,\u201d Alex insists. \u201dWe\u2019ve heard it through the ages \u2014 age is a collection of numbers. But those clich\u00e9s, I really subscribe to that. We have these cultural expectations that you reach a certain age and you&#8217;re supposed to get serious or your retirement savings is supposed to be more important than your dreams. I&#8217;ve never subscribed to that, and I have the bank account to prove it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beach Slang\u2019s debut LP is out this week. It\u2019s called <em>The Things We Do To Find People Who Feel Like Us, </em>and it doubles down on the preceding EPs, amping up the slickness of the guitars and the melodrama of the lyrics. Romanticized depictions of adolescence as a life-or-death battleground have been part of rock tradition from Phil Spector to Bruce Springsteen to <em>Celebration Rock. </em>But Alex\u2019s specialty is writing screamingly emotive rock songs about what it feels like to listen to all of those other screamingly emotive rock songs. Can you blame him for also wanting to <em>live inside</em> of those tunes?</p>\n<p>\u201cLook man, we can&#8217;t all make a living playing guitars, right? I mean, I get that,\u201d Alex says, pushing the gas pedal on his mile-a-minute patter. \u201cBut it&#8217;s like, cool, so come home from the job and then remember the things you do that feed the good parts of you, not just the paying the bills part of you. I&#8217;m still jumping around on a stage like a drunk loon 60 to 70 percent of the year. You can do it, too.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u2666\u2666\u2666</p>\n<p>From the first time I heard <em>The Things We Do To Find People Who Feel Like Us, </em>I knew Beach Slang was my new favorite band. I was already a fan of the EPs and <a href=\"http://grantland.com/features/the-mid-year-music-report-2014-yg-lykke-li-against-me-hold-steady-future/\" target=\"_blank\">had written about them enthusiastically</a>. I also investigated Weston\u2019s back catalogue, so I was aware that Alex\u2019s aesthetic had been honed over the course of many years. (Sample Weston song titles: \u201cTeenage Love Affair,\u201d \u201cHeartbreak Sandwich,\u201d \u201cFeelings Stupit Feelings.\u201d) But <em>The Things We Do </em>instantly felt like a culmination. Alex had precisely hit upon what he had been seeking since the early \u201990s \u2014 a mix of nostalgia and forward-looking optimism communicated via fearlessly shiny riffs and florid clich\u00e9s redeemed by the all-in conviction of a true believer. Suddenly, I realized I had been seeking the same thing. So have lots of people I know. Every single person to whom I have recommended Beach Slang has wound up loving this band. Alex has apparently cornered the market on guileless rock music.</p>\n<p><em>The Things We Do To Find People Who Feel Like Us </em>abounds with potential pitfalls, moments when the spell could be broken by a lyric or musical flourish that\u2019s <em>merely </em>corny rather than transcendently corny. I suppose Beach Slang will elicit groans from those who aren\u2019t on the band\u2019s wavelength no matter what. But for me, as the record progressed on my first listen, the sense of exhilaration grew, from the sweetly sighing backing vocals of \u201cBad Art &amp; Weirdo Ideas\u201d to the intensely rasping chorus of \u201cRide the Wild Haze\u201d to the articulate feedback of \u201cDirty Lights.\u201d When I heard Alex sing, \u201cIf rock and roll is dangerous, how come I feel so safe in it?\u201d in \u201cI Break Guitars,\u201d I felt a lump in my throat. <em>My god</em>, I thought. <em>He\u2019s actually pulling this off.</em></p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/h7YemyR1rGI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>Talking to Alex prompted a sense of relief, because I feared that perhaps this was all a put-on. His album had become a safe space for me to profess all of the beliefs that I had stuffed down into the nether regions of my heart. Beach Slang embodies nearly every single one of these cherished ideals: Earnestness is good. Bombast is good. Rock and roll is the best. Getting drunk can be a noble act. Embarrassing yourself publicly is righteous so long as you\u2019re passionate. You truly can be born to run, so long as you don\u2019t stop believin\u2019 in Siamese dreams. <em>The Things We Do To Find People Who Feel Like Us </em>validates all of this hokum in 30-minute intervals.</p>\n<p>Loving Beach Slang feels like going out on a limb, so it was nice to discover that Alex deserves that trust. In real life as on record, Alex talks like Paul Stanley introducing \u201cStrutter\u201d to a stadium packed with 40,000 wannabe dreamers. Listening to him feels like flying so long as you don\u2019t look down.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u2666\u2666\u2666</p>\n<p>The next time I talk to Alex, it\u2019s before Beach Slang\u2019s show at the Turf Club in St. Paul. I text him when I get to the venue, and he tells me to grab a beer with him at the bar.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy body will always get to that point, where it&#8217;s that right amount of buzz,\u201d Alex says between swigs. I take an extra big gulp from my beer in order to reach that point faster.</p>\n<p>Beach Slang hit bad traffic on the way to the show, so the Replacements sightseeing tour was sadly scuttled. There was only time for a quick visit to the <em>Let It Be </em>house \u2014 the band wasn\u2019t permitted to climb on the roof, but they did snap an ungodly number of photos.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like the better Graceland,\u201d Alex enthuses.</p>\n<p>We chat aimlessly for a few minutes, and then Alex brings up his first punk-rock show: the Ramones at Airport Music Hall in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Alex was 12.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was, like, a little muffin, a little kid, and I walked in, and it felt like outer space to me,\u201d he says. \u201cJust all these big punks in bomber jackets, and the spikes, the whole deal. When the Ramones played, I never saw or felt anything like it. I&#8217;m getting knocked down, and these big punks were picking me up with these big smiles on their faces, like, <em>We got another one. You know, to keep this thing going forward</em>. There was something really beautiful about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>An hour later, Beach Slang is on stage, the middle band on a bill at a club in an unfamiliar town. At first, the indifference is palpable. But Alex doesn\u2019t seem to mind. The journey is what matters \u2014 the destination is gravy. So, he stops before the second verse of \u201cBad Art &amp; Weirdo Ideas\u201d to take a celebratory pull from his beer. Then he whips his guitar recklessly around his torso. Then he hurls his torso to the ground. He\u2019s winning over the crowd. By the end of the set, they\u2019re screaming for more.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don&#8217;t know why everyone isn&#8217;t in a band and [doesn\u2019t get] drunk every night,\u201d Alex says to his latest fans. \u201cIt&#8217;s fucking heaven, man.\u201d</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=303545&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/peoplelikeus36-e1446141782497.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/peoplelikeus36-e1446141782497.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">peoplelikeus36</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4058b0a6e46e203fd21f05d625ae3776?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">daveschilling</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Who Was Missing From Taylor Swift\u2019s Miami Squad?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/who-was-missing-from-taylor-swifts-miami-squad/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2015 16:28:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Molly Lambert]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grantland.com/?post_type=grantland_pop&#038;p=303474</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Taylor left some South Beach legends off the list.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=303474&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the one-year anniversary of <i>1989</i>\u2019s release, Taylor Swift took her victory lap for the album&#8217;s huge success with a huge concert at Miami&#8217;s AmericanAirlines Arena. And in the most controversial Miami\u2013related pop culture event since &#8220;The Decision,&#8221; Swift unveiled her Miami squad. Who made the cut? Pitbull (<em>DALE</em>!), Dwyane Wade, and Ricky Martin. That&#8217;s pretty good, if an unusually testosterone-heavy lineup for a Swift squad annex. But Miami is a big city, and Taylor&#8217;s squad there needs to expand to the size of her &#8220;Bad Blood&#8221; video cast. Having lost some of her Nashville base during her controversial move from country into pop, Taylor needs to reclaim the South more than ever. Here are suggestions for how Taylor can fill out the blank spaces in her Miami squad.</p>\n<h2>Gloria Estefan</h2>\n<p>How could Taylor neglect to ask the most powerful diva in Miami musical history to join her onstage? Is it because Taylor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conga_(song)\" target=\"_blank\">can&#8217;t do the conga</a>? It&#8217;s probably that. Estefan has taken on a lower public profile in recent years, but she would probably have come out to be inducted into the squad. They have a couple of things in common. Swift and Estefan share a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_(Miami_Sound_Machine_song)\" target=\"_blank\">love of bad boys</a>, and they have a ton of Grammys. If she can&#8217;t get Gloria, Taylor should at the very least try for the rest of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Sound_Machine\" target=\"_blank\">Miami Sound Machine</a>.</p>\n<h2>2 Live Crew</h2>\n<p>Taylor has been dipping her toe into the rapper pool, collaborating with Kendrick Lamar and bringing rappers like Nelly and now Pitbull onstage. It&#8217;s time she got into the Jacuzzi with Uncle Luke. If you listen to the subtext of some of Taylor&#8217;s sultrier songs, you will realize she&#8217;s not so far distanced from &#8220;Me So Horny.&#8221; And when you boil it down, aren&#8217;t songs like &#8220;Pop That Pussy&#8221; and &#8220;Throw the &#8216;D\u2019&#8221; about girl power? It&#8217;s time Taylor lets herself be as nasty as she really wants and announce that her next album will be all Miami bass. Taylor can welcome them to the stage, and in return they can say, &#8220;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/notbrodyjenner/status/659277394935607296\" target=\"_blank\">WELCOME 2 THE FUCK SHOP, TAYLOR!</a>&#8221;</p>\n<h2>William H. Macy</h2>\n<p>I bet you had no idea William H. Macy was from Miami! I say that because I had no idea William H. Macy was from Miami. That is because he is the WORLD&#8217;S GREATEST ACTOR! You probably thought this lovable everyman was born in the heart of the Midwest because of <i>Fargo</i>, but no, you cannot spell &#8220;William H. Macy&#8221; without &#8220;Miami.&#8221; Adding Macy to your squad has never been a bad idea. Think of all the squads he has helped with his presence: He&#8217;s an original member of David Mamet&#8217;s squad and has done squad duties for Mamet in <i>Oleanna</i>, <i>State and Main</i>, and <i>Wag the Dog. </i>He&#8217;s proudly in the <i>Mr. Holland&#8217;s Opusquad </i>and<i> </i>Paul Thomas Anderson&#8217;s ultimate Altmanesque megasquads in <i>Boogie Nights</i> and <i>Magnolia. </i>Even the <i>Jurassic Park III </i>squad was enlivened by his presence. And let us not forget his contributions to TV squads on <i>Sports Night</i> and <i>Shameless</i>. If you don&#8217;t have William H. Macy in your squad, is it even a squad worth having?</p>\n<h2>Rick Ross</h2>\n<p>What do Rick Ross and Taylor Swift have in common? They both know how much it hurts to get called a fake bitch. Whatever you feel about Taylor, you cannot deny how much she has bossed up this year as the result of hustling every day.</p>\n<h2>Yngwie Malmsteen</h2>\n<p>As Taylor has shifted from country to pop, she has lost one thing: sweet, sweet guitar shreds. <a href=\"http://www.yngwiemalmsteen.com/yngwie/\" target=\"_blank\">Yngwie Malmsteen</a>, the Swedish guitarist who now lives in Miami, would be a vital asset who could help Taylor recover her shreddingness quotient. Sure, we all like &#8220;Style&#8221; now, but imagine how much more sleazily \u201980s it could get if it had a long, sweaty, technically perfect guitar solo by Yngwie Malmsteen.</p>\n<h2>Trina</h2>\n<p>How dare you come to Florida and not invite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8j0GRz98Rs\" target=\"_blank\">Da Baddest Bitch</a> onstage? How dare you! The Diamond Princess would make a good addition to Taylor&#8217;s squad especially now that she&#8217;s a free agent, no longer contractually obligated to be in the Slip-N-Slide squad with Trick Daddy. Trina could teach Taylor a thing or 12 about breakup songs \u2014 she&#8217;s written both &#8220;fuck you&#8221; and &#8220;love you&#8221; songs about ex Lil Wayne, priceless revenges, and pillow talk (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cy22Woq_Ls\" target=\"_blank\">to please me you gotta sleep in it\u201d</a>).

We really like Halloween.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"2\" href=\"#fn-2\"><sup id=\"ss-2\">2</sup></a> And so we are going to use the upcoming holiday as an excuse to talk about horror-movie monsters for the next 4,500 words. But the whole point of this isn\u2019t just to meander around the graveyard, it\u2019s to figure out who the greatest horror-movie monster is. There are some rules in place to make this a more feasible task:</p>\n<p><b>Rule 1: The monster has to be an actual monster</b>. It can\u2019t just be a person who is horrible and kills a lot of people. We\u2019re talking literal monsters here, not figurative ones. To be clear, you can have the human form, but you have to be more than <em>just</em> a human. For example, guys like Jason Voorhees (<em>Friday the 13th</em>) or Freddy Krueger (<em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>) \u2014 they have human forms, but they\u2019re undead demons of some kind, so that means they\u2019re monsters. Meanwhile, guys like Hannibal Lecter or Norman Bates or Jigsaw \u2014 just boring, old regular humans who kill and kill and kill \u2014 are out. The only exceptions we\u2019re making here are for Michael Myers from the <em>Halloween</em> franchise because he has exhibited superhuman strength enough times to make his status as a regular human legitimately questionable, and Leatherface from the <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> franchise because he\u2019s the best example of someone being a monster while not actually being a monster.</p>\n<p><b>Rule 2: The monster can\u2019t be a real animal</b>. If it\u2019s a real animal you can find in a zoo, it\u2019s eliminated from consideration. Size doesn\u2019t matter, either; could be 10 feet tall, could be 100 feet tall, makes no difference. That means there\u2019s no Jaws, there\u2019s no <i>Lake Placid</i> crocodile, there are no razorback pigs from <i>Razorback</i>, no animals like that.</p>\n<p><b>Rule 3: The monster can\u2019t be a benevolent monster</b>. We\u2019re only talking about monsters who are out for blood and death and gore. Benevolent monsters are boring and dumb and why are you even a monster if you\u2019re not trying to tear someone\u2019s arms from their body. FOH, Harry from <i>Harry and the Hendersons</i>.</p>\n<p><b>Rule 4: The monster can\u2019t be a monster who is only temporarily a monster</b>. If it can transform back into a human, it\u2019s out. Mostly this rule is here to get rid of werewolves, easily the least intimidating and most manageable type of monster.</p>\n<p><b>Rule 5: You can&#8217;t pick any of the classic horror stuff</b>. That means no Dracula, no Frankenstein, no Mummy, no things like that. Or, we suppose those of you playing at home can if you really want, but those guys are always a better idea than they are an actual thing. So let&#8217;s just leave them out so we don&#8217;t feel any obligation to pick them.</p>\n<p>Before we get to identifying the greatest horror-movie monster, there are some horror-movie-monster awards we need to hand out first.</p>\n<p>[<em>Note: It goes without saying, but most of these videos are very bloody and very gross.</em>]</p>\n<h2>Best Outfit</h2>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/IHbIf3K5pdc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> The Mimic, <i>Mimic</i>.</p>\n<p>Do monsters wear outfits? I wasn\u2019t aware they did. Monsters, I\u2019m saying, do not immediately strike me as being concerned about fashion. So this one stumped me for a bit, Shea. But then I thought: What if a creature needed to put its prey at ease, needed to keep its true, vile nature hidden so as to take its victims unawares and avoid the attention of potential predators? What if this monster were, in fact, a gigantic cockroach and therefore had good reason to care about appearances, because people instinctively find roaches disgusting, try to kill them on sight, and would be unlikely to let a roach the size of a human being anywhere near them? I give you the killer roaches from Guillermo del Toro\u2019s American film debut, <i>Mimic</i>, whose chitinous outer shell and wings can be arranged in such a way as to appear like a creepy dude in a raincoat. Which, believe it or not, is better than looking like a roach.</p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> Monsters do wear outfits, yes. Sometimes I like to think about Jason Voorhees getting ready for a long night of killing, standing in front of a mirror, wondering which tattered pair of pants or old military shirt to wear.</p>\n<p><span class=\"photo-credit-wrapper\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-303327\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/bhmm_jason.png?w=658\" alt=\"BHMM_jason\"   /><span>Paramount Pictures</span></span></p>\n<p>Imagine the Creeper from <i>Jeepers Creepers</i> trying to find a hat that best matches his coat.</p>\n<p><span class=\"photo-credit-wrapper\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-303328\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/bhmm_creeper.png?w=658\" alt=\"BHMM_creeper\"   /><span>United Artists</span></span></p>\n<p>Imagine Freddy opening a closet door and it\u2019s just full of green-and-red-striped sweaters.</p>\n<p><span class=\"photo-credit-wrapper\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-303329\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/bhmm_freddy.png?w=658\" alt=\"BHMM_freddy\"   /><span>New Line Cinema</span></span></p>\n<p>Monsters wear outfits, Jason. Yes. And nobody ever had a better outfit than Nomak from <i>Blade II</i>. Look at how great this shit is:</p>\n<p><span class=\"photo-credit-wrapper\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-303330\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/bhmm_nomak_bladeii.png?w=658\" alt=\"BHMM_nomak_bladeII\"   /><span>New Line Cinema</span></span></p>\n<p>It\u2019s so smart and I just really love all the layers. He\u2019s wearing a scarf, Jason. A SCARF. A monster who wears a scarf is a monster that, I think, deserves all the respect and admiration. He legit looks like he walked straight off the Yeezy Season runway. I\u2019ve never looked as cool at any point, even on my best day, as Nomak the monster did here. That\u2019s a very sobering thing to realize, which is what I\u2019m doing right now. Dang.</p>\n<h2>Most Creative Kill</h2>\n<p><b>Shea</b>: I\u2019m going to cheat a little bit here. The most creative kill came not from an actual movie monster, but from a movie cube. Have you ever seen <i>Cube</i>? It came out in 1997. Basically, it\u2019s about a group of people who wake up inside a Rubik\u2019s Cube\u2013like prison and have to figure a way out, except all the rooms periodically shift locations, and oh, just for fun, most of them are booby-trapped and exist only to kill you. But that\u2019s where we get the most creative kill. A guy enters one of the rooms, feels like he\u2019s doing OK at navigating the cube, and then ka-blammo, this happens:</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/k8Tw4JhzORM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>If you have to die in a movie, being turned into a bunch of cheese squares is just about the best way to go, I think.</p>\n<p><b>Jason:</b> This is easy. It\u2019s the electric-chair-lift kill in <em>Gremlins</em>.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/wK30R1gsgGk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>In order to pull off this cruel and ingenious murder, the Gremlins needed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Break into old Mrs. Deagle\u2019s home without her knowing. This step is the easiest for creatures as intelligent and devious as the Gremlins.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Pretend to be Christmas carolers. This is harder than it appears. It requires, first, advance knowledge of Mrs. Deagle\u2019s hatred of Christmas carolers. This part still mystifies me. Then the creatures have to sing in a recognizably carol-y enough way to lure the cantankerous harridan out of her home, AND be prepared with hats, scarves, and &#8212; because the Gremlins really are sticklers for landing a sight gag &#8212; matching sheet music.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Within only the few seconds that Mrs. Deagle is preoccupied while gaping in horror at her yowling little green visitors, the inside Gremlin must then sabotage the woman\u2019s motorized lift chair in such a way for it to accelerate uncontrollably, launching the chair and its occupant out of the window on the top floor of her home and into the street.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> You know what? I watched <em>Gremlins</em> last Christmas with my kids. I remembered it being this charming, fun movie. I\u2019d totally forgotten about all the murder that takes place in it. Those motherfuckers were really just out there killing A LOT of people. I mean, it wasn\u2019t as bad as when I watched <i>Scream </i>with my kids, which was a big-time mistake on my part, but it was surprisingly close.</p>\n<h2>Hardest to Vanquish</h2>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> Sex parasites from <i>Shivers.</i></p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/L6bYIbt-NrY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>True fact: Sex is integral to the survival of the human species. Basically, we have to do it or the human race will just, like, die out. Nature, oh worker of wonders, is a problem-solver and understands this conundrum, which, I would imagine, is why sex feels really good and why the act of human sexual congress can bring people to higher levels of interpersonal understanding, strengthen emotional ties, and engage the mind, body, and soul. In other words: Sex, as a general rule, cannot be avoided.</p>\n<p>Which is why the sexually transmitted blood parasites from David Cronenberg\u2019s 1975 sex-horror classic <i>Shivers</i> are the hardest &#8212; the pun writes itself &#8212; monster to vanquish. They are essentially unvanquishable.</p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> This is actually a great, inarguable answer. I was going to say something like the plants from <i>The Happening</i>, which were releasing that neurotoxin into the air that caused people to commit suicide and were basically unavoidable and also nobody ever figured out how to get rid of them, but I think I like your answer better.</p>\n<h2>Best One-Liner</h2>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> No movie monster ever had one-liners like Freddy Krueger had one-liners. He was basically the <a href=\"http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-definitive-history-of-arnold-schwarzeneggers-greatest-action-movie-quips\" target=\"_blank\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> of movie monsters. Remember <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jdRnk68tB94\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cWanna suck face\u201d</a>? Remember <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wfSm5z5A1pI\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cI\u2019m your boyfriend now, Nancy\u201d</a>? Remember <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AIrxfbXQSYo\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cNo screaming while the bus is in motion\u201d</a>? He had so many great ones. His best one, though, was in <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors</i>, when he hit that TV-obsessed girl with a \u201cWelcome to prime time, bitch\u201d and then smashed her head into a television. That\u2019s just some truly first-class needling.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/FyHQnzcqnlA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>(Also: Laurence Fishburne makes a cameo in that clip. I love Laurence Fishburne so much.)</p>\n<p><b>Jason:</b> \u201cEeeEEeeeeaaAnghhhhhEeeeeAgnnnnhhhhkkkkkkkkKKK.\u201d<br />\n\u2014Godzilla</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ORSvf8eVa0g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<h2>Best Weapon</h2>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> The writings of the novelist Sutter Cane, <i>In the Mouth of Madness</i>:</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/_PFcOeM_Usk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>Best-selling horror novelist Sutter Cane\u2019s latest book causes people to go violently insane. In itself, it&#8217;s not that big of a deal since that means they have to purchase the book first. The real problem is that Cane\u2019s writings are imbued with hidden messages from a race of evil gods from another dimension.</p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> I think this is probably the best example of the philosophical difference between you and me, Jason. A category comes up in this article about the best weapon a horror-movie monster has ever had and here you are skirting around the edges of obscurity, slow-dancing with shrewdness. And I\u2019m like, nah, the best weapon was when the Lubin rapped in <i>Leprechaun in the Hood</i>:</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/XzWlhLSitJ8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>That\u2019s a hot-ass song, my dude. IT\u2019S NOT MY PICK, THOUGH.</p>\n<p>My pick is definitely Leatherface\u2019s chain saw. It has to be, right? There\u2019s just no other reason a person who is not a <a href=\"http://grantland.com/features/blades-of-glory/\" target=\"_blank\">lumberjack</a> would be holding a chain saw except to mess you up. Plus, you don\u2019t even have to see it to be scared. You just have to hear it. It\u2019s so loud and unsettling and just is a totally terrifying thing. It\u2019s the worst. It is SO the worst.</p>\n<h2>Most Likely to Be Able to Turn His or Her (or Its) Life Around</h2>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> Swamp Thing.</p>\n<p>I know you said no benevolent monsters, but let\u2019s be real: A true monster would never be able to turn its life around. A true monster sees people as walking Hot Pockets and just wants to eat their intestines. So I went with Swamp Thing.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/lxRS8f1nkDY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>New-horror pioneer Wes Craven\u2019s <em>Swamp Thing</em>, the schlocky 1982 adaption of the Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson DC Comics character, is the most underrated movie in the director\u2019s oeuvre. Which is not to say it\u2019s a good movie. The costumes appear and indeed were cheap. There are numerous continuity errors and the writing is bad. But Craven got the idea for <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street </i>while working on the movie, his first Hollywood picture, so there is that.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the titular Swamp Thing was once the botanist Alec Holland, who was working on creating a plant-animal hybrid for the government. An attack by a shadowy mercenary group wrecks his lab and sends him fleeing into the swamps, his body doused in chemicals and burning with an eerie flame. Transformed into the hideous Swamp Thing, he still &#8212; as the scene above shows &#8212; retains his personality and intelligence. So, like, all he needs is a cure for looking like human food mold and he\u2019s totally good to return to society.</p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> You\u2019re probably right. But I\u2019m just a sucker for a man who\u2019s a rebuilding project, I suppose. Give me Pinhead from <i>Hellraiser </i>for this category. I just really feel like if I hung out with him for long enough, I could convince him to chill. Plus, I\u2019m very into the whole suburban goth thing he has going on. He\u2019s secretly the most handsome of all the horror-movie monsters. That should matter here.</p>\n<h2>Most Misunderstood Movie Monster</h2>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> It\u2019s Dren from <i>Splice</i>.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/44jmGgZe6QQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>Dren, the product of a genetic experiment combining human and animal DNA, did not ask to be created. She did not ask to experience the loneliness of being the only thing (thank god) like herself on earth or to biologically mature at an astronomical rate that was totally out of proportion with her mental and moral development. So, while truly a monstrosity, she is basically innocent.</p>\n<p><b>Shea:</b> This is the only time I\u2019m mad about the rules we set in place. Jaws from <i>Jaws </i>would\u2019ve been perfect here. He wasn\u2019t a monster. He was just hungry, which, as far as I can tell, is the whole point of being a shark.</p>\n<h2>Best Backstory</h2>\n<p><b>Jason:</b> The Xenomorphs from the <i>Alien </i>series.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/LSHAgmGR-Ig?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>Forget for a moment that the <i>Alien </i>prequel <i>Prometheus </i>was kinda garbage-y from an entertainment standpoint.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"3\" href=\"#fn-3\"><sup id=\"ss-3\">3</sup></a> Here is the backstory for the Xenomorphs established by the film: Alien scientists<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"4\" href=\"#fn-4\"><sup id=\"ss-4\">4</sup></a> whose mission calls for them to sacrifice their lives in order to seed barren worlds with life using a viscous black goo, and who are probably the source of all life on earth, establish a facility on a faraway world that is subsequently hastily abandoned. It is discovered by human beings, one of whom becomes impregnated by the black goo, eventually giving birth to a cthulhu-like beast that itself goes on to impregnate one of the original alien scientists with something we later find out is the precursor to the Xenomorphs. Now that\u2019s a backstory.</p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> It is quite a backstory, yes. But I like my backstories to be easily explainable and easily understandable, particularly in a horror movie, because you need to be able to explain everything important in no more than, say, three seconds, because that\u2019s usually about how long you have to react if you want to survive. So if I\u2019m sitting in my house with a person who has zero knowledge of anything and a killer walks in the front door, I need to be able to say something like, \u201cYo! That\u2019s the guy who went crazy and killed his sister! He\u2019s gonna kill us, too! RUN!\u201d and have that be the end of it. I don\u2019t have time for questions. I don\u2019t need someone like, \u201cWait a second. Did you say Jesus was an alien scientist?\u201d because when you start asking questions is when you die. So for that reason, give me Michael Myers\u2019s backstory. It\u2019s nice and linear.</p>\n<h2>Most Evil Monster</h2>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> Satan, <i>The Prophecy</i>.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/XhT9KtQb0ac?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>It\u2019s Satan, yo.</p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> OK. You got this one. I concede.</p>\n<h2>Least Intimidating Movie Monster</h2>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> Lubin from <i>The Leprechaun </i>movies.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/TY0WYSt7JMA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a leprechaun, yo.</p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> WHAT? No, Jason, no. You\u2019re trending the right direction \u2014 it\u2019s a smaller guy \u2014 but it\u2019s not Lubin. Lubin was legit terrifying. And stout. He looked like a little ball of muscle. He\u2019d be a tough out.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about this: Let\u2019s say it\u2019s just you versus a horror-movie monster in an empty room and only one of you is leaving alive (or as alive as a movie monster can be, anyway). If it\u2019s you in that room and Lubin walks in? Nah. Nope. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re not intimidated by him. He\u2019s just a scary, creepy-looking dude. The only guy who could walk into that room and you\u2019d be like, \u201cOK, I\u2019m good here, I\u2019m not the guy who\u2019s dying\u201d? Chucky from <i>Child\u2019s Play</i>. Look at him:</p>\n<p><span class=\"photo-credit-wrapper\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-303331\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/bhmm_chucky.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"BHMM_chucky\"   /><span>United Artists</span></span></p>\n<p>You could literally pick him up and just hold him away from your body and you\u2019d be 100 percent safe. No way it\u2019s anybody but Chucky for this category. No way any movie monster is less intimidating than him.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s enough awards, I think. Let\u2019s get to the 10 best horror-movie monsters.</p>\n<h2>10. Ganush, <i>Drag Me to Hell</i></h2>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> You know what? I feel like maybe I got this one wrong, but maybe I didn\u2019t. Here\u2019s the thing, Jason: Whenever you and I work on one of these things, I always end up having to watch a few movies I missed from the past. <i>Drag Me to Hell</i> was like that. I didn\u2019t see it when it came out, and were it not for researching this article, I likely never would\u2019ve seen it. But I watched it. And I loved it. It\u2019s such a good scary movie, in that it\u2019s scary and gross and occasionally unsettling but also fun and enjoyable and with parts you never even thought you wanted to see. To wit, there\u2019s a YouTube video called \u201cTo Hell (2009) &#8211; Mouth Moments (Funny),\u201d and it\u2019s just all the parts of the movie when something crazy happens that involves a mouth, one of which is Ganush <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xJpEha5A6gA\" target=\"_blank\">vomiting bugs into the mouth of the woman she\u2019s haunting</a>.</p>\n<p>Some monsters that I expected to make this list didn&#8217;t. There\u2019s no Pinhead, there\u2019s no Sil from <i>Species</i>, there\u2019s no Seth Brundle from <i>The Fly</i>, there are no super earthworms from <i>Tremors</i>, there\u2019s no fish monster from <i>The Host</i>, there are no cave dwellers from <i>The Descent </i>(one of my favorite scary movies of the last 10 years), there\u2019s no Creeper from <i>Jeepers Creepers</i> (another of my favorites, and a wildly underrated franchise), there\u2019s no Pennywise from <i>It</i> (WHAT????), there\u2019s no <i>Slither</i>, there\u2019s no <i>It Follows</i>, there\u2019s no Chucky from <i>Child\u2019s Play</i>, THERE\u2019S NO CANDYMAN (FOH HOW DID CANDYMAN NOT MAKE IT??????). But Ganush makes it. I don\u2019t know how, but she makes it. And I couldn\u2019t be happier about it.</p>\n<h2>9. Samara, <i>The Ring</i></h2>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/WA3B-AZFJIU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> If someone gives you a cursed videotape, don&#8217;t watch the tape. After you don\u2019t watch the tape, continue to not watch the tape and repeat not watching the tape for the rest of your life. <em>If</em> you should happen, somehow, to watch the tape, then, within seven days, copy the tape and give the copy to someone you don\u2019t like, making sure not to mention it\u2019s cursed.</p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> I would give TF outta this tape to people. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m dying if the only thing I have to do not to die is have someone else die. That\u2019s a little thing called Darwinism, my friend. Same thing if I\u2019m running from a killer. I love you, Jason, but if it\u2019s me and you and we\u2019re running from someone who\u2019s trying to kill us both, I am 100 percent kicking you as hard as I can in the knee so you\u2019re hobbled so the killer can catch you and I can escape. That\u2019s just how it\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m sorry.</p>\n<h2>8. Michael Myers, <i>Halloween</i> Series</h2>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/MuG14CT-qds?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> He\u2019s always seemed like the coldest, most ruthless, most black-eyed killer of all the movie monsters. I think it\u2019s because he never talks (same as Jason Voorhees) and also because he wears a mask even though it\u2019s not necessary, which I\u2019m sure says something about his general psychosis (Jason\u2019s mask was functional, in that by the end of the series it was very clear he was not a human anymore).</p>\n<p>He\u2019s second in <a href=\"http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3316822/10-deadliest-horror-movie-villains-kill-count/\" target=\"_blank\">total kills</a> (Jason is the leader with more than 300 confirmed kills; Myers has 111; Lubin from <em>The Leprechaun</em> has 45; Freddy Krueger has 42; Pinhead has 35) and first in consistency (nobody is more on-brand). He\u2019s my favorite horror-movie killer, so I\u2019d have liked to have seen him land closer to the second or third spot, but eighth feels right, him hiding back here in the bushes waiting to drive that butcher knife into your sternum.</p>\n<h2>7. The Babadook, <i>The Babadook</i></h2>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/szaLnKNWC-U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> <strong>[THIS ONE CONTAINS SPOILERS.]</strong> If you find a strange and mysterious children\u2019s book in your home, think twice before reading it to your child. If, after reading said strange and mysterious book to your child, you find yourself experiencing unexplained events and weird dreams, leading you to destroy the book, only to find that the book has reassembled itself and is waiting for you on your stoop, then seriously consider whether you may have, in fact, written the mysterious book yourself and are repressing the memory of doing so.</p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> I just watched this movie. As soon as it was over I was like, \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m never reading another book to one of my kids again.\u201d Also, \u201cBabadook\u201d is just a great fucking name for something that\u2019s supposed to be scary.</p>\n<h2>6. Leatherface, <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> Series</h2>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/R_NH1-NIMhk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> I still remember watching the remake at the movie theater in 2003. I was in college. And I was really feeling like it was a good idea to take the girl I was dating. But it was not a good idea. It was a super-bad idea. There was that one part when Leatherface hangs the guy on the meat hook and the girl tries to get him off it but she can\u2019t and so she\u2019s trying to slide him off and he keeps dropping back down on it. That remains the closest I\u2019ve ever come to throwing up in a theater. AND THAT WAS JUST THE REMAKE OF THE SCENE, which is inferior to the original version, in which Leatherface hangs a girl on a meat hook and then carves up a guy with a chain saw in front of her as she dangles and screams and dangles.</p>\n<p>I went on this haunted hayride thing one time in San Antonio. It was real cool. You paid $10 or so, then you just sat on this platform that was pulled by a tractor through the woods and all of these scary things would happen along the way. Michael Myers was there. Jason was there. Freddy was there. But nobody inspired the same sort of fear that Leatherface did when he came running out from the brush with his chain saw just BRRRRRRRARAAARRRRRing. People were literally jumping off the ride to run away. I&#8217;ve never forgotten that. (I didn\u2019t run away, because I\u2019m <i>not </i>a coward. I just closed my eyes real tight and grabbed hold of whomever it was that was sitting next to me because actually, yes, I am a coward.) I think maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s the one guy out of all of these movies who could actually exist in real life. Or maybe it\u2019s the sound of that chain saw starting up. Or maybe it\u2019s his mask made of human skin. It\u2019s probably some combination of all of those things (but mostly him possibly being real). Either way, he deserves to be on here. He probably deserves to be higher, truthfully.</p>\n<h2>5. Sex Parasite, <i>Shivers</i></h2>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/MCseP01zg7w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> In <i>Shivers</i>, a bioengineered parasite runs rampant through an upscale Montreal apartment complex, transforming the building\u2019s bourgeoisie inhabitants into an orgiastic horde of zombies who hunger for fresh flesh to infect. After the last holdout is organized into submission, the DTF-infected surge into the streets to turn out Montreal proper and, one expects, the world.</p>\n<h2>4. Freddy Krueger, <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i> Series</h2>\n<p><b>Shea:</b> As far as iconography goes, Freddy is either at the very top or he loses out only to Jason Voorhees. I mean, he had a fucking song with Will Smith, that\u2019s how popular he was in the \u201980s.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/BfPONqyaI9Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>(The best thing about this song is the disbelief Will expresses about Freddy wearing a sweater even when it\u2019s hot outside. I suppose this is a valid concern.)</p>\n<p>One of the things I\u2019ve always liked about Freddy is his sense of self-awareness. He\u2019s a showy guy, and he\u2019s not above <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq2yONl3yII\" target=\"_blank\">hamming things up when need be</a>. I think that\u2019s important, at least some of the time. And yet, still, he\u2019s a master killer, and he for sure is inescapable (he\u2019ll either kill you in your sleep, or you\u2019ll go crazy and die from not getting any sleep, which is a real thing I didn\u2019t know could happen). He\u2019s got that great face, that great glove, that great voice, that great attitude, that great everything. It feels wrong having him fourth. It just feels wrong.</p>\n<h2>3. The Thing, <i>The Thing</i></h2>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/p35JDJLa9ec?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> You\u2019re not paranoid if everyone around you really is an alien in disguise that\u2019s out to kill you. The alien monster in <i>The Thing </i>could be anything: your wife, your husband, your dog, your best dude, pre-diebeetus Wilford Brimley, anyone.</p>\n<p><b>Shea</b><strong>:</strong> Very surprised the Thing managed to sneak this far up the list.</p>\n<h2>2. Jason Voorhees, <i>Friday the 13th</i> Series</h2>\n<p><b>Shea: </b>He. Is. A. Relentless. And. Perfect. Killing. Factory.</p>\n<p>He has the greatest horror-movie kill of all time (when he snatched that girl up while she was in her sleeping bag and slammed it against the tree), he has great accessories (his mask, of course, but also his machete), he has a very strong backstory (died as a kid, returned to kill a bunch of people because he was mad about that and also about his mom getting killed), he quietly had a sense of humor, or if not that then a sense of irony (remember when that one boxer tried to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKQVHClcUfs\" target=\"_blank\">fistfight Jason</a> and so he just stood there and let the guy punch himself out and then hit him with a left cross that literally knocked his head off his shoulders? Or the time <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09yOZsZuxMY\" target=\"_blank\">he was on <em>Arsenio Hall</em></a>?), and he was essentially unkillable. I will argue forever that he should\u2019ve finished first. He\u2019s the obvious winner, Jason.</p>\n<p>Alas &#8230;</p>\n<h2>1. The Alien, <i>Alien </i>Series</h2>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='658' height='401' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/U2XTmjjhC5U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Jason</b><strong>:</strong> The alien Xenomorph MOUNTS YOUR FACE, FORCES ITS EGG DEPOSITOR INTO YOUR MOUTH AND DOWN INTO YOUR STOMACH, AND LAYS ITS EGG INSIDE OF YOU, WHERE IT GROWS UNTIL IT BURSTS OUT OF YOUR CHEST, BEGINNING THE CYCLE ANEW. THIS IS THE BEST MONSTER IN MOVIES.</p>\n<p><strong>Shea:</strong> Oh snap. I forgot about that part. Out of all the ways we&#8217;ve seen someone die in this column, having an alien deposit an egg in your stomach via your mouth (GROSS!) and then having that alien explode out of your chest (GAH!) is probably the least desirable way to go. Please continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Right. And to make things even scarier, the alien\u2019s fictional life cycle and biology is actually mirrored in real-life science.

Perhaps this is fitting. In 2015, TV can be many things that are appropriate to the holiday: shocking, horrifying, sticky-sweet, overcommercialized, and deeply, deeply gross. But one thing it still struggles with is fear.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"5\" href=\"#fn-5\"><sup id=\"ss-5\">5</sup></a> Don&#8217;t believe me? Take a moment to consider: What&#8217;s the last regular TV show that was actually full-stop scary? I don&#8217;t mean frightful in bits and pieces, like one of Leatherface&#8217;s victims. I mean a show that is scary from top to bottom, from beginning to end. And I mean a show other than, say, <a href=\"http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-check-in-wow-dads-is-somehow-even-worse-than-the-pilot/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Dads</i></a>.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a criticism so much as it&#8217;s a fact of life. Movies, with their contained running times, are especially good at sustaining mood. When you take your seat for a horror film, you&#8217;re essentially agreeing to be on the edge of it for 90 to 120 minutes. TV, by its very nature, demands a diversity of tone and pitch. Viewers simply can&#8217;t be asked to hold their breath for eight, 10, or even 22 hours a season. Try it and they&#8217;ll be dead even sooner than your show. Instead, TV traditionally has had to play in the margins of horror, building entire series out of the offcuts and scraps usually undervalued by the <i>Fangoria</i> crowd: the slow, agonizing buildup; the stolid, yeomanlike investigation; the long, sorrowful denouement. (Or, as is the case with <a href=\"http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/whitegirlproblems-the-terror-of-scream-queens-draws-from-greek-life-reality/\" target=\"_blank\">Fox&#8217;s smarmy <i>Scream Queens</i></a>, the idea that a sneer can wound more deeply than a knife.) A scary movie is a turn through a haunted house. A scary TV show is more of a haunted time-share. There have to be at least occasional feints toward amenities like comfort and humor because, let&#8217;s be honest, you&#8217;re going to be there awhile.</p>\n<p>If anyone were going to crack the horror code on TV, I would have expected it to be a pay service like HBO or Netflix, with their unlimited makeup budgets and freedom to micro-target audiences with the precision of a serial killer. But the two most successful series to challenge the primacy of scary cinema both hail from the diabolical Jigsaws in basic cable. FX&#8217;s <i>American Horror Story</i>, still <a href=\"http://decider.com/2015/10/27/john-landgraf-ahs-hotel-premiere-fx-top-rated-episode-of-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">slaying the ratings</a> in its fifth iteration, is likely the closest TV has ever come to the specificity and sustained craziness of film. Part of this is due to the show&#8217;s creative casting and unquenchable thirst for extremity. But let&#8217;s be honest: The most noteworthy aspect of <i>AHS </i>isn&#8217;t the bearded lady, it&#8217;s the length of each season. By limiting each cycle to 13 hours and a single story, the show&#8217;s one, discordant note can ring out like a symphony. One doesn&#8217;t watch <i>AHS</i> so much as one <i>commits</i> to it.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"6\" href=\"#fn-6\"><sup id=\"ss-6\">6</sup></a></p>\n<p>AMC&#8217;s <i>The Walking Dead</i> is even more noteworthy. Not only is it far and away television&#8217;s <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2015/10/walking-dead-ratings-rise-week-3-glenn-rhee-steven-yeun-talking-dead-sunday-night-football-1201595094/\" target=\"_blank\">most popular show</a> among the highly coveted 18-to-34-year-old demographic, it has almost single-handedly refuted every one of the ideas laid out in my opening paragraph. Where most serialized dramas create a world and, over time, spread out into it, adding characters, nuance, and layers, <i>The Walking Dead</i> has a guillotine where the story engine should be. It has no interest in saving the world or curing the zombie outbreak. Instead, it sets up base camp in the crushing moment when most dystopic movies end, sinking into the heartbreak, violence, and loss. &#8220;Everything is fucked,&#8221; isn&#8217;t a traditional TV starting place, but, then again, <i>The Walking Dead</i> isn&#8217;t a traditional series. Its remarkable proficiency in areas often considered ancillary &#8212; sound design, visual effects, editing, and casting &#8212; has helped sustain it, even when the plot veers decidedly into a sort of sadistic nihilism. And, in a perverse way, the bleak consistency of <i>The Walking Dead</i> &#8212; no matter what else is going on, someone&#8217;s getting bitten every week &#8212; is precisely what saves it as a TV show. At this point, the constant, gruesome suffering has become as dependable as a laugh track.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_303353\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-303353\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/twd_episode3_dumpster.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Walkers - The Walking Dead _ Season 6, Episode 3 - Photo Credit: Gene Page/AMC\"   /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span>Gene Page/AMC</span></p></div>\n<p>This Sunday&#8217;s <a href=\"https://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-walking-dead-so-is-beloved-character-really-zombie-meat/\" target=\"_blank\">controversial episode</a> actually further cemented <i>The Walking Dead</i>\u2019s connection to the rest of TV. In the <a href=\"http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/ask-the-maester-jon-snow-season-finale/\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Snow</a> era, beloved shows have far outstripped the boundaries of their time slots. Fandom is a full-contact sport that runs around the clock, seasons be damned. That showrunner Scott M. Gimple <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2015/10/walking-dead-spoiler-glenn-rhee-cliffhanger-scott-gimple-1201593362/\" target=\"_blank\">had to qualify</a> a major death &#8212; and thus step on his own dramatic narrative mere minutes after setting it in motion &#8212; was further proof that winking gamesmanship no longer works in a world where everyone is playing on such a high level. On <i>The Walking Dead</i>,<i> </i>humans may just be oversize chum for the zombie masses. But in reality, these characters are intimates, welcomed into our homes every week. A modern showrunner can, and should, rough them up. But he needs to remember to respect them.</p>\n<p>Despite this misstep, my main takeaway from &#8220;Thank You&#8221; was admiration. Though <a href=\"https://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-walking-dead-season6-premiere/\" target=\"_blank\">there remain plenty of nits</a> to pick about <i>The Walking Dead</i>, I&#8217;m thoroughly impressed by the show&#8217;s ability to harness tricky, fast-burning emotions like anguish, stress, and desperation and corral them within the confines of a weekly series. The panicked, almost druggy fugue state that Nicholas fell into as an impossible horde of zombies surrounded him was contagious. I&#8217;m not saying I can relate to the choice he made in that moment &#8212; but, god, who could blame him? Again and again, I&#8217;m finding the sheer scale of this season of <i>The Walking Dead</i> deeply unsettling; death has long been ever-present but rarely so monumental or, seemingly, inevitable. This relentlessness is radical for television, and in particular for Sunday-night television, which has long been the warming hearth of the country&#8217;s viewing week. It&#8217;s a pivot that has helped <i>The Walking Dead</i> become TV&#8217;s most horrific show in more than a literal sense; it ravages emotions now, not just entrails.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, right about the time most kids will be home counting their candy, two chilling, off-kilter series will premiere, each seeking to keep the jack-o&#8217;-lantern lights on well into November. Though SundanceTV&#8217;s <i>The Returned</i> is back for a second season &#8212; <a href=\"http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-walking-no-longer-dead-the-sundance-channels-the-returned-goes-for-smart-horror/\" target=\"_blank\">I loved the first</a> &#8212; it&#8217;s <a href=\"http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/ash-vs-bruce-campbell-the-b-movie-legend-returns-to-the-evil-dead/\" target=\"_blank\">Starz&#8217;s <i>Ash vs Evil Dead</i></a> that&#8217;s actually the more familiar of the pair. That&#8217;s because it picks up a baggy story that first began in 1978, when two frustrated Midwestern drama dorks named Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell filmed a bloody short called <i>Within the Woods</i>. From that splattery snippet came a cult empire: a trilogy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Dead_(franchise)\" target=\"_blank\">beloved movies</a>, plus a host of video games, comic books, and <a href=\"http://www.tested.com/art/makers/465482-bits-atoms-building-evil-dead-chainsaw/\" target=\"_blank\">unlimited opportunities</a> for cosplay. The only connective tissue between all of it: Raimi&#8217;s inimitable tongue-in-cheek/ax-in-hand aesthetic and Campbell&#8217;s performance as Ashley &#8220;Ash&#8221; Williams, a one-handed Everyguy in possession of a spirit-summoning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necronomicon\" target=\"_blank\">Necronomicon</a>. When ghouls come calling, Ash is generally there to dispatch them with a fusillade of one-liners and shotgun shells. With no more mountains to climb on the big screen (a <a href=\"http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-evil-dead-remake-if-you-want-blood-youve-got-it/\" target=\"_blank\">cinematic reboot</a> fizzled in 2013) and no more <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U883K-W77ZY\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Spider-Man </i>dance-offs</a> to choreograph, the two have taken their trademark chain saw to the one frontier remaining to them: the small screen.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about <i>Ash vs Evil Dead</i>: It&#8217;s good. Better, it&#8217;s fun in a goofy, infectious way that&#8217;s the polar opposite of <i>The Walking Dead</i>\u2019s po-faced frown. You don&#8217;t need to have any familiarity with the franchise&#8217;s history or humor before tuning in. I&#8217;d say that the opening montage of the now-57-year-old Campbell attempting to squeeze into a girdle is a pretty good introduction, as is the scene in which a Michigan detective (Jill Marie Jones) is attacked by a neck-twisting poltergeist whose head ultimately explodes with the force and liquid velocity of one of Gallagher&#8217;s overripe melons. What&#8217;s great about <i>Ash vs Evil Dead</i> isn&#8217;t that it doesn&#8217;t take itself seriously &#8212; though, come on, it totally doesn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s that it picks and chooses very carefully the details it <i>ought</i> to take seriously. So Campbell &#8212; still the Iberico de Bellota of B movie hams &#8212; gives as much thought to Ash&#8217;s Chaplinesque pratfalls as he does the chain-saw-swinging swagger. And Raimi, who directed the first hour and cowrote or produced the remaining nine, imbues every high-jumping, skittering demon with both gravity and wit. With its severed limbs and references to Shabbos dinner, this isn&#8217;t your father&#8217;s horror show. It&#8217;s your wacky uncle&#8217;s. And thank god for it.</p>\n<p>On the complete other end of the spectrum is <i>The Returned. </i>If <i>Ash vs Evil Dead</i> is a spouting artery of gleeful gore, the French series is rigor mortis itself. In the first season, the residents of a remote mountain town were undone when their dead relatives suddenly returned to life, seemingly unscathed and frozen at the age they were when they expired. So: A teenage girl is suddenly reconnected to her barely adolescent twin, a young mother is visited by the fianc\u00e9 who killed himself while she was pregnant, a bar owner who happily buried his murderous brother years ago must find a way to accept him back into his orbit. It&#8217;s a bold premise, to be sure, and a lesser show would have balked at the pressure to provide answers. But the beauty of <i>The Returned</i> was the uncomfortable manner in which it asked its heavy questions, the way it allowed its impossible dream of a premise to curdle, subtly and slowly, into a sour nightmare.</p>\n<p>In Season 2, <i>The Returned</i> remains as discomfiting and elliptical as ever. Few shows are as starkly beautiful; its palate of ghostly grays and harsh, metallic light suggests the work of an impressionist T-1000. And the music, once again composed by the Scottish noise poets Mogwai, is subtle and devastating. A flood has cleared out the town, and the dead have set up their own society in the mountains. The imminent arrival of Ad\u00e8le&#8217;s (Clotilde Hesme) baby &#8212; she was impregnated last season by the very much deceased Simon (Pierre Perrier) &#8212; is what drives the plot, but, the truth is, plot seems almost secondary in such an eerie landscape. Indeed, <i>The Returned </i>doesn&#8217;t scare so much as it haunts. On a show like this, it&#8217;s the living who slowly drop their masks to reveal the scarred monsters lurking underneath. The supernatural is really just a mirror for the frightening possibilities of human nature. It&#8217;s this psychological dismemberment, not the bloodier, more literal kind, in which television has historically excelled. That&#8217;s because, when a movie ends, you can walk quickly out of the theater and retreat to the quiet safety of home. On TV, the scariest sights are always coming <a href=\"http://www.skyladawncameron.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tumblr_mg0wdveyAN1r75c30o1_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\">from inside</a> the house.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=303350&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/ashvsevildead-e1446070915528.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/ashvsevildead-e1446070915528.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">ashvsevildead</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1d98326d31cba8316f4e5acca6f1a6fb?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">marklisanti</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/twd_episode3_dumpster.jpg?quality=100&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Walkers - The Walking Dead _ Season 6, Episode 3 - Photo Credit: Gene Page/AMC</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>&#8216;The Andy Greenwald Podcast&#8217;: Aya Cash of &#8216;You&#8217;re the Worst&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-andy-greenwald-podcast-aya-cash-of-youre-the-worst/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2015 13:26:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andy Greenwald]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grantland.com/?post_type=grantland_pop&#038;p=303452</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA['You're the Worst' costar Aya Cash joins Andy Greenwald to discuss acting, N.Y. vs. L.A., and her character's remarkable dramatic turn.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=303452&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>You&#8217;re the Worst</em> costar Aya Cash joins Andy Greenwald to discuss acting, New York vs. Los Angeles, and her character&#8217;s remarkable dramatic turn.</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-303452-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;

Of course I loved Adam Sandler. I was 12. I still thought dogs farting was funny back then.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"7\" href=\"#fn-7\"><sup id=\"ss-7\">7</sup></a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not even going to pretend I&#8217;ve <em>seen</em> an Adam Sandler movie in years, either. You think I have two hours of my life set aside for <em>The Cobbler</em>? <em>Blended</em>? The last Sandler joint I saw to completion was probably <em>You Don&#8217;t Mess With the Zohan</em> \u2014 a motion picture in which the Sand Man portrays an Israeli soldier who moves to America in order to fulfill his dream of being a hairdresser. I happen to like <em>Zohan</em> a lot because it features Adam Sandler doing three things we know he will make amusing just through sheer Sandler strength:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Speaking in a bad Israeli accent</li>\n<li>Doing krav maga</li>\n<li>Solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That last one is important, because it&#8217;s probably the main reason why I like that movie. Here&#8217;s a guy known for some of the dumbest comedies not a part of either the <em>Police Academy</em> or <em>Scary Movie</em> franchises tackling one of the most dispiriting, bloody sectarian conflicts on the planet. I have to give our man credit for trying to squeeze in a message about tolerance into a very broad comedy. Plus, it features Adam Sandler doing the splits in increasingly ridiculous action scenes. Imagining sleepy-faced Sandler kicking ass might be even funnier than a dog farting, which is saying a lot.</p>\n<p><em>The Ridiculous 6</em>, Sandler&#8217;s first film in a lucrative deal with Netflix, appears to have much in common with <em>Zohan</em>. Once again, a guy who perpetually looks hungover is being sold as something of a tough guy. Also, it&#8217;s similarly set around the subject of ethnic and cultural division. In this case, Sandler is mucking about with the plight of Native Americans, but in the run-up to its release, <em>The Ridiculous 6 </em>has done quite a bit to highlight just how poorly we tend to treat our Native population. It&#8217;s basically the Daniel Snyder of cinema.</p>\n<p>Native American cast members and the cultural adviser <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/23/adam-sandler-ridiculous-six-native-americans-racism\" target=\"_blank\">quit the film</a> over jokes they felt were insensitive to their people. The bad press piled up as leaked pages from the script made <em>Little Nicky</em> look like <em>Grand Illusion</em>. Months before the film&#8217;s streaming release, it already has a reputation for being a duffel bag full of horseshit. Yesterday, audiences around the country were finally treated to actual footage in the form of a trailer. The law of averages says I am going to either (a) hate this film, or (b) never see it because the reviews say it&#8217;s terrible. But in the interest of fair play, I&#8217;m going to spend the next two minutes and 13 seconds with a completely open mind.</p>\n<p>After that time is up, I will close my mind again.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-303261\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-28-at-8-18-15-am.png?w=658\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-10-28 at 8.18.15 AM\"   /></p>\n<p>The early parts of this trailer go to great lengths to set up the Sandy Man as some kind of badass \u2014 a laconic, unknowable figure of menace rolling into town with a reputation for doing awful things, not unlike Adam Sandler himself.

I remember when Vanilla Ice was coming up at Second City. He got onto a Harold team faster than anyone I&#8217;ve ever known. From there it was writing jokes for &#8220;Weekend Update,&#8221; joining the staff of <em>The Tonight Show</em>, penning a couple &#8220;Shouts &amp; Murmurs&#8221; pieces, and putting on his one-man show Off Broadway. Somehow, he found the time to write &#8220;Ice Ice Baby,&#8221; and the rest is history.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-303296\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-28-at-9-28-02-am.png?w=658\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-10-28 at 9.28.02 AM\"   /></p>\n<p>Whatever is happening in this scene, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s quite respectful of the history and culture of Native Americans.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-303297\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-28-at-9-29-20-am.png?w=658\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-10-28 at 9.29.20 AM\"   /></p>\n<p>This might be the edgiest logo in movie history for what will probably end up being the least-edgy movie in movie history. For all the controversy surrounding <em>The Ridiculous 6</em>, it will likely only be remembered as &#8220;that Sandler movie where Dan Patrick played Abe Lincoln.&#8221; You&#8217;d hope that our society could get to a point where films about Native Americans could be made where they&#8217;re more than a punch line, where the main character is actually Native and doesn&#8217;t employ the <em>Dances With Wolves</em> rule. It&#8217;s inevitable that our more perfect union will come to fruition eventually, but in the meantime we&#8217;re just going to have to suffer through garbage like this. It could actually be <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003662/\" target=\"_blank\">much worse</a>.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

Every so often, 28-year-old Rembert Browne will watch a video from the past. Rembert will write down his thoughts as he\u2019s watching the video, then we\u2019ll post those thoughts here. This week is the final installment, selected by Rembert Browne: \u201cUnleash the Dragon\u201d by Sisqo, from the year 1999. If you have an idea for a future episode of Rembert Explains, it is unfortunately too late.</em></p>\n<p>(This is not the first time I&#8217;ve written about this video on Grantland. In one of the early YouTube Hall of Fame posts [date: October 26, 2011], this was my blurb pick for <a href=\"http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/youtube-hall-of-fame-the-worst-music-videos-of-all-time/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;The Worst Music Videos of All Time.&#8221;</a> Feels right to go long on it, four full years later.)</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/32218064\" width=\"640\" height=\"272\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"SISQO &quot;Unleash The Dragon&quot;\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>0:02</strong> This video is already more expensive than it should be. Two seconds in, there has already been the sound of a helicopter, an aerial shot, and an actual crowd.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303074\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-27-12-58-34.png?w=942&#038;h=400\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-10-27 12.58.34\" width=\"942\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><strong>0:08</strong> Why did all of these people show up for this video? I&#8217;ve never seen so many people make such a bad decision at the same time.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303077\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-27-13-00-19.png?w=946&#038;h=399\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-10-27 13.00.19\" width=\"946\" height=\"399\" /></p>\n<p><strong>0:11</strong> It&#8217;s so upsetting that instead of just doing a music video they tried to make this into a &#8220;movie.&#8221; This is what happens when you have the &#8220;Thong Song&#8221; and then get the green light to release more singles that were never supposed to be singles. Releasing &#8220;Unleash the Dragon&#8221; after &#8220;Thong Song&#8221; is like getting good at football and then just assuming you&#8217;d automatically be good at poetry.</p>\n<p><strong>0:19</strong> Yes, this is a barricade and news crew, for Sisqo. A LOCAL NEWS CREW.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303090\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-27-14-11-53.png?w=888&#038;h=347\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-10-27 14.11.53\" width=\"888\" height=\"347\" /></p>\n<p><strong>0:22</strong> What a time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7oh4.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303091\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7oh4_gif_static.gif?w=577&#038;h=245\" data-animate=\"http://i1.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7oh4.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7oh4\" width=\"577\" height=\"245\" /></a></p>\n<p>I want to be very clear about something: I love Sisqo. He was the lead singer of one of the most underrated R&amp;B groups of all time, Dru Hill. Every time I watch the video to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BTlDtxFuBg\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;5 Steps,&#8221;</a> I cry, especially when THAT DOVE COMES OUT AT THE END AND THEN SISQO KNEELS \u2014 LORD LORD LORD.</p>\n<p>But this song is inexcusable. And this video absolutely takes it over the top, in the sense that maybe he (and everyone involved) should have gone to prison as soon as it was finished.</p>\n<p><strong>0:25</strong> People really brought flags to this Sisqo block party like it was Glastonbury. Unreal.</p>\n<p><strong>0:27</strong> I haven&#8217;t seen this video in years, so there are going to be quite a few Sisqo realities that I forgot existed. Like the chain.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303094\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-27-14-19-41.png?w=765&#038;h=402\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-10-27 14.19.41\" width=\"765\" height=\"402\" /></p>\n<p>Also, WHY THE UNDERSCORE AFTER &#8220;DRAGON&#8221;? I&#8217;m already getting pissed off.</p>\n<p><strong>0:28</strong> Just as a reminder, it&#8217;s almost been half a minute and there has not been any music. Also, why are human beings helping Sisqo put on his jackets like he&#8217;s Jed Bartlet or something?</p>\n<p><strong>0:29</strong> Imagine being the recipient of sunglasses from Sisqo and him not even looking at you. Just absolutely disrespectful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7ozr.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303097\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7ozr_gif_static.gif?w=713&#038;h=303\" data-animate=\"http://i0.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7ozr.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7ozr\" width=\"713\" height=\"303\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>0:37</strong> Sisqo finally sang something &#8212; &#8220;the dragon&#8221; &#8212; in Sisqovoce. Also, he spun a microphone around his finger, which I can&#8217;t make a GIF of because it&#8217;ll give me a computer virus.</p>\n<p><strong>0:38</strong> It&#8217;s at this point in music history that Sisqo begins one of our biggest buildups and then immediately lets down humanity like we&#8217;ve rarely ever seen. He hits us with the spoken word:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What I&#8217;m about to do<br />\nI&#8217;m sure nobody expected<br />\nBut that&#8217;s what I do</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303099\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-27-14-27-50.png?w=846&#038;h=400\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-10-27 14.27.50\" width=\"846\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<blockquote><p>Y&#8217;all know me<br />\nRight now<br />\nI&#8217;m about to release the dragon<br />\nUh, uh, come on</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>0:55</strong> And then the drop:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here I come<br />\nN\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-s hold me back</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7pmd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303101\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7pmd_gif_static.gif?w=713&#038;h=303\" data-animate=\"http://i0.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7pmd.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7pmd\" width=\"713\" height=\"303\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.</p>\n<p>Nothing is funnier than this. I&#8217;m sorry. Nothing. I&#8217;ve never seen someone be less intimidating in their most intimidating life moment than what Sisqo does right here. He lost the battle before the minute mark, and there are still six more minutes.</p>\n<p><em>HERE I COME. N\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-S HOLD ME BACK \u2014 </em>I NEED OXYGEN.</p>\n<p>One of the best parts is the crowd reaction. They love it. &#8220;GO SISQO WE LOVE YOU&#8221; they&#8217;re probably screaming as he berates them with HERE I COME / N\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-S HOLD ME BACK.</p>\n<p><strong>1:02</strong> I feel like this is definitely Ben Carson&#8217;s go-to song in karaoke.</p>\n<p><strong>1:03</strong> He has more lyrics.

Fun fact: The &#8220;Unleash the Dragon&#8221; video is the prequel to <i><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485985/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Tails</a>.</i></p>\n<p><strong>1:10</strong> One of the notes I made in that 2011 blurb about &#8220;Unleash the Dragon&#8221; was about the probable plan leading up to writing the lyrics: &#8220;Sisqo should say the N-word more than 70 times.&#8221; Through 70 seconds, he&#8217;s very much on pace:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Bugged out n\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-s<br />\nThugged out n\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-s<br />\nI don&#8217;t really care<br />\nYou all my n\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-s</p></blockquote>\n<p>And wouldn&#8217;t you know it, the crowd loves it. But it&#8217;s almost as if he wants the crowd to take him more seriously, but they&#8217;re not &#8212; PERHAPS CAUSING ANGER THAT MIGHT, IN TURN, CAUSE HIM TO UNLEASH THE DRAGON.</p>\n<p><strong>1:11</strong> In case anyone was wondering what record label Sisqo was on at the time:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303106\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-27-14-44-23.png?w=918&#038;h=395\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-10-27 14.44.23\" width=\"918\" height=\"395\" /></p>\n<p>Yep, the answer is, in fact, Def Soul.</p>\n<p><strong>1:16</strong> Sisqo has made it to the chorus, but he&#8217;s still so serious. And he&#8217;s on his balcony, with his <em>Red Tails </em>dancers, singing and dancing, begging the crowd to take him seriously. But they won&#8217;t; the crowd is just smiling and cheering from below. He&#8217;s assuring them, &#8220;Y&#8217;all n\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-\u200b-s gon&#8217; make me / unleash the dragon.&#8221; But they&#8217;re not listening. Then he&#8217;s all, &#8220;I know you don&#8217;t really wanna / unleash the dragon.&#8221; But still, they&#8217;re just so gleeful, happy to be at a Sisqo concert. But what they don&#8217;t know &#8212; a fact that Sisqo clearly knows &#8212; is that this is bigger than any normal concert. The stakes are at an all-time high.</p>\n<p><strong>1:18</strong> The ground begins to shake, causing everyone to become a very bad actor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7r50.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303108\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7r50_gif_static.gif?w=682&#038;h=290\" data-animate=\"http://i1.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7r50.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7r50\" width=\"682\" height=\"290\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>1:28</strong> The sudden quakes are getting so bad that Sisqo stops singing. Not dancing, however, as he and the Red Tails would never slow down. No one can really know, but I feel as if the seismic disturbances are slightly connected to this dragon Sisqo keeps talking about.</p>\n<p><strong>1:47</strong> Around this point of the song/video, it gets unnecessarily bad. It&#8217;s the point when the video fully takes over the song; the commotion of the scene is three times louder than the lyrics and the music, which is enhanced only because Sisqo is barely singing anymore &#8212; since, you know, this video is real and all.</p>\n<p><strong>1:56</strong> This is so bad. Sisqo goes three seconds without singing, and then just screams &#8220;OH NA NA NA.&#8221; How did this happen. How the hell did this happen?</p>\n<p><strong>1:59</strong> Uh-oh.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303111\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-27-14-54-34.png?w=887&#038;h=402\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-10-27 14.54.34\" width=\"887\" height=\"402\" /></p>\n<p>This could be bad. Also, most of the crowd has been launched to the ground by what the newscaster with the slicked-back hair is calling &#8220;an earthquake.&#8221; But I have a feeling Sisqo is the only one who&#8217;s thinking, <em>Wait, this might not be an earthquake, in which case I</em> really<em> might have to unleash the dragon</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>2:08</strong> BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7rq9.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303113\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7rq9_gif_static.gif?w=696&#038;h=296\" data-animate=\"http://i1.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7rq9.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7rq9\" width=\"696\" height=\"296\" /></a></p>\n<p>THAT&#8217;S A DRAGON, LADIES AND GENTS.</p>\n<p><strong>3:10</strong> A full minute goes by of this dragon just destroying everyone on one city block, stepping on cars and punching buildings while various terrified people say, &#8220;OH SHIT.&#8221; Where&#8217;s Sisqo? Very unclear. Is this still a Sisqo video? Very unclear. Is there any music left? Very unclear.</p>\n<p><strong>3:12</strong> The only thing more puzzling than a dragon?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7s12.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303116\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7s12_gif_static.gif?w=623&#038;h=265\" data-animate=\"http://i2.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7s12.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7s12\" width=\"623\" height=\"265\" /></a></p>\n<p>Tatyana Ali. Don&#8217;t try to make sense of it. Just accept what has happened. Tatyana Ali is about to be the damsel in distress for Dragon Sisqo in this seven-minute movie that could have been a Vine.</p>\n<p><strong>3:26</strong> Oh, hi, Sisqo, how nice of you to join us in your own music video &#8212; NOW MIGHT BE A NICE TIME TO UNLEASH THE DRAGON, BRUH.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7sdd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303119\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7sdd_gif_static.gif?w=607&#038;h=258\" data-animate=\"http://i1.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7sdd.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7sdd\" width=\"607\" height=\"258\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>3:40</strong> What happens after Sisqo sees Tatyana down by the dragon is the dumbest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. First, Sisqo yells &#8220;HEY!&#8221; at the dragon as if he&#8217;s in <em>Newsies </em>and it&#8217;s like <em>c&#8217;mon, son</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7sk0.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303122\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7sk0_gif_static.gif?w=576&#038;h=245\" data-animate=\"http://i2.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7sk0.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7sk0\" width=\"576\" height=\"245\" /></a></p>\n<p>After this dragon-unleash of a scare tactic, the dragon looks right at him and Sisqo says, &#8220;What do you think you&#8217;re doing, scaring people, stepping on cars?&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303124\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-27-15-11-31.png?w=941&#038;h=405\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-10-27 15.11.31\" width=\"941\" height=\"405\" /></p>\n<p>The dragon breaths on him, launching Sisqo back to the doorway, and then <em>out of nowhere </em>the music starts again and he just sings &#8220;OH NA NA NA.&#8221; It&#8217;s almost as if this were done in one take, no script, and everyone had just been molly-waterboarded.</p>\n<p><strong>3:46</strong> &#8220;I know you don&#8217;t really wanna&#8221; \u2014Sisqo, covered in dragon saliva, to the dragon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7sxa.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303126\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7sxa_gif_static.gif?w=605&#038;h=257\" data-animate=\"http://i0.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7sxa.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7sxa\" width=\"605\" height=\"257\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>4:11</strong> This dragon, obviously very post-Sisqo, begins to start swinging at him, like the gnat that he is. Luckily for Sisqo, he is really good at front flips.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7t3y.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303129\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7t3y_gif_static.gif?w=605&#038;h=257\" data-animate=\"http://i2.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7t3y.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7t3y\" width=\"605\" height=\"257\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>4:41</strong> The next 30 seconds are really dark, even by &#8220;Unleash the Dragon&#8221; standards. After all of this, they had the nerve to <em>unleash two rap verses </em>by two rappers whom I refuse to look up, both of whom are wearing snakeskin outfits wrapped in turkey bacon.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303133\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screenshot-2015-10-27-15-21-25.png?w=805&#038;h=405\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-10-27 15.21.25\" width=\"805\" height=\"405\" /></p>\n<p>And for those of you who are concerned with the dragon-tearing-up-the-city plot, yes, this verse is taking place in a room that the dragon just destroyed. And no, they are not concerned for their safety, because the room assuredly has Cristal.</p>\n<p><strong>5:00</strong> Here is your five-minutes-in Sisqo-in\u2013<em>The </em><em>Matrix</em> update, for anyone still sick enough to be reading this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7tn6.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303134\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7tn6_gif_static.gif?w=581&#038;h=247\" data-animate=\"http://i2.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7tn6.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7tn6\" width=\"581\" height=\"247\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is also the moment when I realize this is the greatest video of its time. It&#8217;s like seven different nightmares stitched together, brought to you by the infinite budgets of the late \u201990s.</p>\n<p><strong>5:20</strong> Sisqo&#8217;s doing flips and avoiding being killed by the dragon, but I also just remembered that Sisqo has that belly tattoo. Just didn&#8217;t want to leave that out.</p>\n<p>Also, Sisqo is getting his little ASS kicked, but doing it in style.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7tzw.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303136\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7tzw_gif_static.gif?w=576&#038;h=245\" data-animate=\"http://i2.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7tzw.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7tzw\" width=\"576\" height=\"245\" /></a></p>\n<p>That shot alone cost more than <em>Whiplash</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>6:00</strong> If you hadn&#8217;t guessed, Sisqo ends up defeating the real dragon by unleashing his inner dragon. What, exactly, is his inner dragon? Dancing the dragon to death.</p>\n<p>First he does his heroic moves:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7uah.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303140\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7uah_gif_static.gif?w=574&#038;h=244\" data-animate=\"http://i1.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7uah.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7uah\" width=\"574\" height=\"244\" /></a></p>\n<p>And then he puts on his shades (this time, on his own).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7udc.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303139\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7udc_gif_static.gif?w=576&#038;h=245\" data-animate=\"http://i0.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7udc.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7udc\" width=\"576\" height=\"245\" /></a></p>\n<p>And then he runs under the dragon, causing it to fall in an alley, the end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7ufd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-303138\" src=\"https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7ufd_gif_static.gif?w=576&#038;h=245\" data-animate=\"http://i1.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/t7ufd.gif?strip=all&ssl=1\" data-autoplay=1 alt=\"t7ufd\" width=\"576\" height=\"245\" /></a></p>\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s how he defeats the dragon and saves the world. Like every first-level boss of a video game, he just confuses it and it dies. Wow, some dragon Sisqo has inside. Good thing he&#8217;s so clever when his black outfit turns red and he becomes the dragon, out-dragoning an actual dragon. Thank god for Sisqo.</p>\n<p><strong>6:33</strong> What Sisqo does next \u2026 just sit down before you read the next line. It&#8217;s actually too much, the nerve he has at this moment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;SISQO.

Without it, a third of my lifetime tears never would have left my eyes.

He strides \u2014 no, <em>glides \u2014 </em>past adoring fans huddled by the back door of the Hammerstein Ballroom. A boxy 57-year-old composed of perfect right angles, his jet-black hair is still and subdued and his purple suit jacket is loud and dynamic. Like Bruce Wayne dressed as the Joker.</p>\n<p>He extends his hand and offers me a ride.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re game over,\u201d Bruce Campbell says, referring to my being his final interview of the day.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s early October in Manhattan, and the world\u2019s greatest B movie actor is nearing the end of a long day at New York Comic Con. He\u2019s just appeared in front of several thousand people assembled for a panel hosted by Kevin Smith for the new Starz series <em>Ash vs Evil Dead,</em> a 10-episode sequel to the original <em>Evil Dead </em>trilogy, which in the \u201980s and \u201990s established Campbell as the postmodern John Wayne.</p>\n<p>The hallmarks of the original films \u2014 nonstop gore, <em>Three Stooges\u2013</em>inspired comedy, that meddlesome Necronomicon, Campbell\u2019s gleeful jackassery \u2014 have all been restored with assistance from Campbell\u2019s longtime collaborators, director Sam Raimi and producer Rob Tapert. Ash Williams is now 23 years older though not necessarily wiser, living the high life in a Michigan trailer park amid a haze of self-important delusion and marijuana smoke, when the undead suddenly return to settle old scores, moving at breakneck speed while 3 feet off the ground in that uniquely <em>Evil Dead </em>sort of way. Joining him is a cast of junior demon slayers and an enigmatic adversary played by Lucy Lawless. But Campbell is unquestionably the star attraction.</p>\n<p>If the response to the pilot\u2019s world premiere during the Comic Con panel is any indication, <em>Ash vs Evil Dead </em>should adequately service the fan base. The faithful squealed with delight at every severed head and ridiculous one-liner. Smith registered his approval by using the word \u201cjism\u201d at least twice during the Q&amp;A. In that room, at least, <em>Ash vs Evil Dead </em>killed.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"11\" href=\"#fn-11\"><sup id=\"ss-11\">11</sup></a></p>\n<p>How big of a deal is Bruce Campbell at Comic Con? That morning, I watched Campbell and the show\u2019s cast and crew press the flesh and sign autographs for 100 lucky fanatics. For these folks, meeting Bruce Campbell is akin to a religious experience \u2014 he\u2019s like the pope of campy horror, and his followers line up for hours to proudly display their amazingly elaborate <em>Evil Dead </em>tattoos and chain-saw-accessorized Ash costumes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do a lot of them,\u201d Campbell says of the convention circuit as we settle in the back of a black SUV. \u201cEvery year is different, but I usually do half a dozen a year. Sometimes more depending on whether I&#8217;m promoting something \u2014 I knew this year would be <em>Evil Dead</em>, so I made sure to go to a bunch of them so you can cross-promote, all that crap.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He stares into the distance as we pull out and head east toward Campbell\u2019s hotel. \u201cSome actors are freaked out \u2014 they&#8217;ll go once and never go again,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cIt&#8217;s too close: People are on the elevators with you, they&#8217;re looking at what you&#8217;re eating, it&#8217;s all too precious. I&#8217;ve had a different M.O. I enjoy the fooling around with the audience, messing with them \u2014 tormenting them, you know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A, most of the Q\u2019s were for Campbell, and his A\u2019s typically weren\u2019t actual answers, but rather reiterations of Ash\u2019s asshole shtick. As <em>Ash vs Evil Dead </em>showrunner Craig DiGregorio explains to me later, there are three Bruce Campbells. \u201cThere&#8217;s the Bruce that you just kind of hang out and talk to, who&#8217;s just the best, nicest guy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then there&#8217;s the Bruce at Comic Con who turns it on. He&#8217;s amazing at it \u2014 he can say mean stuff to people that ask questions, and it comes off in such a charming, funny way. And then there&#8217;s all of the characters he plays.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Bruce, nowadays, is some combination of Bruce and Ash \u2014 he&#8217;s like <em>Brash</em>,\u201d concurs Raimi. \u201cI think that those groups wanna see Ash. They really like that character, and Bruce is the ultimate actor. He wants to give it to them, so he takes on a little bit more of that character&#8217;s persona.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the past decade, Campbell\u2019s highest-profile roles have been in television \u2014 he was an ex\u2013Navy SEAL named Sam Axe (which sounds like Ash) on USA\u2019s long-running series <em>Burn Notice</em>, and he was cast as Ronald Reagan (who\u2019s basically Ash as a senior citizen) in the current season of the acclaimed FX drama <em>Fargo. </em>He\u2019s also played a heightened version of himself in niche projects that appeal mostly to diehards. <em>My Name</em><em> <em>Is Bruce \u2014 </em></em>a 2007 horror-comedy that he starred in, directed, and coproduced \u2014 featured Campbell in a <em>Galaxy Quest</em>\u2013esque scenario in which he is mistaken for a real monster slayer. <em>Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way </em>was a fantasy novel he published in 2005 after his memoir, 2001\u2019s <em>If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor</em>, became a surprise best seller.</p>\n<p>\u201cMeta\u201d Bruce resembles \u201cComic Con\u201d Bruce \u2014 conceited, selfish, a little dumb, and yet ultimately heroic. Campbell\u2019s greatest talent is his ability to simultaneously personify and satirize an outmoded form of peacocking masculinity. Here in this SUV, as he transitions from performing for a worshipful public to the solitude of his hotel room, Campbell is stuck somewhere between \u201creal\u201d Bruce and \u201cComic Con\u201d Bruce. But who, exactly, is the real Bruce?</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t get too deep now. You\u2019re going to bonk your head after about a foot under the water,\u201d Campbell tells me. Then he makes an analogy to old-timey comedian W.C. Fields.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was in a couple movies, he was the world&#8217;s greatest juggler at one point, he did vaudeville all around the world, and he made up all of his own press releases,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cPeople don&#8217;t know anything about the real W.C. Fields now because he made up such a ton of shit.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u2666\u2666\u2666</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s some shit that\u2019s not made up about Bruce Campbell: He was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, in 1958. The acting bug bit Bruce when he was 8 \u2014 he followed the example of his father, Charlie, a frustrated artist turned billboard inspector who channeled his creative impulses into Detroit-area community theater. When Bruce entered his teen years, he started making Super 8 movies with friends from the neighborhood. Around this time, he encountered a weird kid in the halls of his junior high school dressed like Sherlock Holmes. Bruce thought the kid was a creep. His name was Sam Raimi.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe met in drama class,\u201d Campbell recalls. \u201cWe started talking pretty much right away, because he was a weird bird.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce was a bit of a weirdo himself \u2014 he was known around school for wearing his father\u2019s crushed velvet smoking jacket. (&#8220;I could put my shit in its pockets,\u201d he says now. \u201cIt was very practical.\u201d) Bruce and Sam pooled their resources with other local kids and set up an ad hoc kiddie production company. Together they made dozens of movies, mostly comedies, and screened them at a local theater. By the time they graduated from high school in the late \u201970s, Campbell and Raimi were seasoned amateurs determined to make a full-length feature.</p>\n<p>They did market research at local drive-ins and discovered that horror films were both cheap to make and highly profitable. Guided more by Midwestern pragmatism than a true allegiance to the genre, they shot a supernatural thriller called <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yul22fUJBFc\" target=\"_blank\">Within the Woods</a></em> that later became the basis for 1981\u2019s <em>The</em> <em>Evil Dead. </em>As Hollywood outsiders operating at the start of the blockbuster era, Campbell, Raimi, and Tapert used <em>Within the Woods </em>to tirelessly solicit local dentists and doctors for <em>Evil Dead</em>\u2019s financing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe investors have probably made 30, 35 times their money. They&#8217;re <em>still</em> making it,\u201d Campbell says proudly. \u201cIt took six years to break even on their investment. For some people that was too long to wait. But now that they have waited, it&#8217;s well worth it. They got checks this year. Not small ones, either.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Two more films followed \u2014 1987\u2019s <em>Evil Dead II </em>and 1992\u2019s <em>Army of Darkness </em>moved the series in a wackier, more irreverent direction, prodded by Campbell\u2019s gonzo performance as the perpetually put-upon Ash. By the time <em>Army of Darkness</em> premiered, the character had evolved into a veritable <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFriRcIwqNU\" target=\"_blank\">boomstick</a> of catchphrases. But in spite of their subsequent status as cult classics, those movies were far from box office successes.</p>\n<p>Over the next 20 years, Campbell and Raimi went legitimate \u2014 Campbell got his own TV series, the short-lived <em>The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.</em>, which was sort of like <em>Gunsmoke </em>for the <em>Simpsons </em>generation, and then landed a regular spot on <em>Xena: Warrior Princess </em>with his current <em>Ash vs Evil Dead </em>costar Lawless. Raimi, meanwhile, helmed the <em>Spider-Man </em>franchise, which grossed just over $1 billion domestically in the aughts. <em>Evil Dead II </em>and <em>Army of Darkness</em>, in comparison, made just $18 million combined.</p>\n<p>Then something funny happened: As Raimi\u2019s <em>Spider-Man </em>movies were rebooted just five years after 2007\u2019s lackluster <em>Spider-Man 3</em>, a clamor arose for a return of <em>The Evil Dead</em>. While that franchise was also revived with a new cast in 2013 \u2014 Raimi, Campbell, and Tapert stayed on as producers \u2014 what fans really wanted was more Ash.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter I made <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, we kept hearing the fans say, \u2018We don&#8217;t need any more <em>Spider-Man</em>, we really want to see <em>Evil Dead</em>,\u2019&#8221; Raimi says with a wry laugh. \u201cAnd I&#8217;d complain. \u2018Why? I made three of those, let&#8217;s move on to something else.\u2019 But they kept asking for it. So I finally said to Ivan, my brother, \u2018Let&#8217;s write this thing, because no one&#8217;s asking us for anything except this.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>While Raimi originally conceived <em>Ash vs Evil Dead </em>as a feature, Campbell and Tapert \u201cbadgered\u201d him to make it a TV series, because \u201cwe didn&#8217;t want to make a $200 million <em>Evil Dead</em> movie,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cSam makes big movies now, you know? It&#8217;d be very tough for him to go back \u2014 that far back \u2014 to make a really cheap <em>Evil Dead</em> movie. But television seems to work. You can take time to get an audience if you can&#8217;t find them right away.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u2666\u2666\u2666</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s address a question that arises with every revival of a long-cherished pop-culture institution: Is <em>Ash vs Evil Dead </em>necessary? The short answer is: probably not. But while <em>The Evil Dead </em>didn\u2019t <em>need </em>to be resuscitated, <em>Ash vs Evil Dead </em>is executed about as well as you could possibly hope for, striking a tricky balance between the straightforward terror of the first <em>Evil Dead </em>and the slapstick surrealism of <em>Evil Dead II. </em>If the series can follow through on the promise of Raimi\u2019s whizz-bang pilot, <em>Ash vs Evil Dead</em> could very well be the most complete <em>Evil Dead </em>experience yet.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"12\" href=\"#fn-12\"><sup id=\"ss-12\">12</sup></a></p>\n<p>For Campbell, working with Raimi affords the sort of creative freedom that he often doesn\u2019t get elsewhere. One of his professional pet peeves are persnickety writers who are overly precious about their dialogue. Bruce Campbell needs to talk like Bruce Campbell, says Bruce Campbell.</p>\n<p>On 1995\u2019s <em>Congo</em>, Campbell felt stymied by John Patrick Shanley, the Pulitzer Prize\u2013 and Tony-winning playwright and screenwriter, who for some reason was hired to write a movie about genius apes. Campbell was still chafing about the experience as we arrived at his hotel room.</p>\n<p>\u201cJohn Patrick Shanley had the Paddy Chayefsky clause, where actors are not allowed to change a word,\u201d says Campbell, offering me a seat at a conference table inside his suite. \u201cThat&#8217;s bullshit! I call bullshit. You don&#8217;t get to call the end of this process, Mr. Writer. You&#8217;re not the end of it. I&#8217;m the end of it. Because the words are coming out of my mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Most of the time, Campbell isn\u2019t working with the John Patrick Shanleys of the world. His cinematic bread and butter is made up of movies with titles like <em>Alien Apocalypse</em>,<em> Waxwork II: Lost in Time</em>, and <em>Assault on Dome 4</em>. The key to understanding Bruce Campbell \u2014 the real Bruce Campbell, not the hammy approximation he puts on at Comic Con \u2014 is the sense of professionalism he brings to every project. Campbell is self-aware enough to realize when he\u2019s working on a turkey \u2014 he calls it his <em>Crimewave </em>meter, named after Raimi\u2019s disastrous 1985 follow-up to <em>The Evil Dead </em>that nearly derailed all of their careers<em>.</em><a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"13\" href=\"#fn-13\"><sup id=\"ss-13\">13</sup></a> What Campbell has learned over time is how to play out the string, like a baseball team that knows in July that it\u2019s not making the playoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can smell when a production is off,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I do in those cases, I just go on autopilot. Not like I give up, but I&#8217;m like, <em>That guy&#8217;s not going to help me</em>. No one&#8217;s going out of their way to make sure this is going to look and sound good. So I just gotta get what I need and do it, and not worry about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He\u2019s come close to quitting acting only once: at the end of the \u201980s, when his first marriage was on the rocks. (\u201cI wasn\u2019t at home a lot,\u201d he says.) But Campbell remarried in 1991, and his children, Rebecca and Andy, are now grown. As dusk approaches, and the publicist hints that it\u2019s time for dinner, Campbell deflects further inquires about his personal life. No matter his more than 366,000 Twitter followers, he is not part of the over-sharing generation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should fuck with your persona,\u201d he says emphatically. \u201cI don&#8217;t want anyone looking at me like I&#8217;ve got all the answers. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t go political on Twitter \u2014 because then you&#8217;re putting yourself there for real. I don&#8217;t need to make an issue out of everything. Not everything is an issue to me. So I find it weird to see guys like Mark Ruffalo, who are like, &#8216;Fracking is bad,&#8217; and the next <!-- Invalid tweet id --> is, &#8216;See Marvel superheroes.&#8217; It\u2019s like, don&#8217;t consume this, but consume that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The publicist finally gives me the wrap-up signal. Campbell has successfully maintained his cocksure fa\u00e7ade. Before I go, I wonder if he has any regrets.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Maniac Cop</em> at the time seemed great. Would I do it now? No. Probably not,\u201d Campbell says. He doesn\u2019t mention that he came back for <em>Maniac Cop 2. </em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grantland.com&#038;blog=60203239&#038;post=303157&#038;subd=espngrantland&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1-10.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1-10.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">1 (10)</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4058b0a6e46e203fd21f05d625ae3776?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">daveschilling</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>",
