In the first study of its kind, the researchers analyzed the outcome of a reconciliation program in Sierra Leone between 2011 and 2012, a decade after the country ended its civil war, in which more than 50,000 people were killed and many tens of thousands more were mutilated or raped by fighters. The program, carried out across 100 villages, brought together victims who described violence they experienced and perpetrators who admitted to crimes and asked for forgiveness.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/post-war-reconciliation-open-wounds-deepen-trauma-researchers-220957306.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:09:57 -0400</pubDate><source url=\"http://www.reuters.com/\">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">post-war-reconciliation-open-wounds-deepen-trauma-researchers-220957306</guid></item><item><title>Senate sets votes on competing Zika funding plans</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/senate-leaders-offer-options-zika-response-funds-173617060--business.html\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/YaxHUf0nDwEYhEXxPSU.og--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztmaT1maWxsO2g9ODY7cT03NTt3PTEzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2016-05-12T173617Z_1_LYNXNPEC4B1IH_RTROPTP_2_HEALTH-ZIKA-FRIEDEN.JPG\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are seen at the Laboratory of Entomology and Ecology of the Dengue Branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in San Juan\" align=\"left\" title=\"Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are seen at the Laboratory of Entomology and Ecology of the Dengue Branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in San Juan\" border=\"0\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Richard Cowan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three competing plans for battling a potential Zika virus outbreak in the United States were presented on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Thursday, as lawmakers tried to break an impasse pitting President Barack Obama against congressional Republicans.

Researchers examined data from Medicare, the U.S. government health program for the elderly, for 752 white and 131 black patients with final-stage breast cancer who died from 2007 to 2012. Black women were 49 percent less likely to receive certain medications for symptom relief than white patients, and they were also 14 percent less likely to get hospice care aimed at improving quality of life in their final days, the study found.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/much-palliative-care-breast-cancer-patients-may-depend-212154452.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:21:54 -0400</pubDate><source url=\"http://www.reuters.com/\">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">much-palliative-care-breast-cancer-patients-may-depend-212154452</guid></item><item><title>Tell the FDA what you fear more: Zika, or GMO mosquitoes?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/tell-fda-fear-more-zika-gmo-mosquitoes-143319573.html\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/NbXGBfcEyc1_KMBSvHuB_A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztmaT1maWxsO2g9ODY7cT03NTt3PTEzMA--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/images/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS/7e010d5921d04cefb3831195fe9d003f_original.jpg\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"Tell the FDA what you fear more: Zika, or GMO mosquitoes?\" align=\"left\" title=\"Tell the FDA what you fear more: Zika, or GMO mosquitoes?\" border=\"0\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;MIAMI (AP) \u2014 What are you more afraid of, the Zika virus, or genetically engineered bugs being released in the wild?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=\"all\"/&gt;</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/tell-fda-fear-more-zika-gmo-mosquitoes-143319573.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:21:28 -0400</pubDate><source url=\"http://www.ap.org/\">Associated Press</source><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">tell-fda-fear-more-zika-gmo-mosquitoes-143319573</guid><media:content url=\"http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/NbXGBfcEyc1_KMBSvHuB_A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztmaT1maWxsO2g9ODY7cT03NTt3PTEzMA--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/images/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS/7e010d5921d04cefb3831195fe9d003f_original.jpg\" type=\"\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\"></media:content><media:text type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/tell-fda-fear-more-zika-gmo-mosquitoes-143319573.html\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/NbXGBfcEyc1_KMBSvHuB_A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztmaT1maWxsO2g9ODY7cT03NTt3PTEzMA--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/images/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS/7e010d5921d04cefb3831195fe9d003f_original.jpg\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"Tell the FDA what you fear more: Zika, or GMO mosquitoes?\" align=\"left\" title=\"Tell the FDA what you fear more: Zika, or GMO mosquitoes?\" border=\"0\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;MIAMI (AP) \u2014 What are you more afraid of, the Zika virus, or genetically engineered bugs being released in the wild?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=\"all\"/&gt;</media:text><media:credit role=\"publishing company\"></media:credit></item><item><title>Senate deal reached on reduced Zika funding measure</title><description>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Top Senate negotiators announced agreement Thursday on a $1.1 billion emergency funding measure to battle the Zika virus.

McDonald's USA last year committed to a timeline for moving to chicken raised without antibiotics vital to fighting human infections and to boosting average hourly pay for about 90,000 workers in its company-owned restaurants. Darden has vowed to phase out meat from farm animals that are fattened up with antibiotics that are important to human medicine by the end of this year.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/activists-call-darden-limit-antibiotics-boost-worker-pay-185745511--finance.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:57:45 -0400</pubDate><source url=\"http://www.reuters.com/\">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">activists-call-darden-limit-antibiotics-boost-worker-pay-185745511--finance</guid></item><item><title>Oregon man's conviction for not changing diaper overturned</title><description>(Reuters) - An Oregon appeals court has wiped away a father's criminal conviction for not changing his son's diaper for at least 14 hours, overturning a jury's verdict that the man was guilty of mistreatment. The ruling by a three-judge panel on Wednesday found prosecutors in Lane County, south of Portland, failed to prove the dad, James Christopher Hickey, had failed to perform a diaper change for the boy on repeated occasions. As a result, evidence of a \"single untimely diaper change was not sufficient to allow a jury to find\" Hickey had not protected the child from future \"bodily harm,\" the Oregon appeals court ruled in a 10-page opinion.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/oregon-mans-conviction-not-changing-diaper-overturned-184116673.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:41:16 -0400</pubDate><source url=\"http://www.reuters.com/\">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">oregon-mans-conviction-not-changing-diaper-overturned-184116673</guid></item><item><title>White House says any progress in Congress on Zika funding is 'welcome'</title><description>The White House said on Thursday it would welcome any progress made by the U.S. Congress toward striking a deal to provide funding to help fight the Zika virus. \"I think at this point, given the delays and given the heightened stakes, we welcome any sort of forward momentum in Congress,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-says-progress-congress-zika-funding-welcome-183931968--business.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:39:31 -0400</pubDate><source url=\"http://www.reuters.com/\">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">white-house-says-progress-congress-zika-funding-welcome-183931968--business</guid></item><item><title>Bacteria the yin and yang of dandruff, says study</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/bacteria-yin-yang-dandruff-says-study-182442029.html\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/xshi._3bdm_f7Z9tFmw8Rg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztmaT1maWxsO2g9ODY7cT03NTt3PTEzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/Part-WAS-Was7725053-1-1-0.jpg\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"Dandruff is the most common scalp disorder on the planet, a tonsorial bane for about half the world&amp;#039;s population\" align=\"left\" title=\"Dandruff is the most common scalp disorder on the planet, a tonsorial bane for about half the world&amp;#039;s population\" border=\"0\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dandruff is not caused by a fungus, as many believe, but by an imbalance between two competing bacteria that naturally colonise the human scalp, according to a study released Thursday.
