In this InformAction production (Nathalie Barton), co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada (Ren\u00e9 Ch\u00e9nier) in association with Majda Films International, the filmmaker captures the recent journey of Micha\u00eblle Jean through Canadian society and diplomacy. This personal and sensitive portrait takes us behind the scenes, revealing her growth as a stateswoman. Jean's appointment as Governor General of Canada was a historic moment. Not only was she the first black woman to occupy Canada's highest office, she would also redefine the role through her desire to turn it into a space for civic engagement and her focus on cultural diplomacy. The screening will be attended by the director, Micha\u00eblle Jean, Hot Docs president Chris McDonald, and Government Film Commissioner and NFB Chairperson Claude Joli-Coeur. A post-screening Q&A will be hosted by Anna Maria Tremonti (CBC Radio's The Current) with Jean-Daniel Lafond and Micha\u00eblle Jean.]]></summary><category term=\"Society and Culture\"></category><category term=\"Arts, Music, Literature\"></category></entry><entry><author><name>Canadian Heritage</name></author><title>Minister Joly issues statement on Vaisakhi</title><link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1050849&amp;tp=980\"></link><updated>2016-04-13T13:55:00+00:00</updated><id>http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1050849&amp;tp=980</id><summary type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\"><![CDATA[I would like to extend my warmest best wishes to the Sikh community and to everyone celebrating Vaisakhi today.]]></summary><category term=\"Government and Politics\"></category></entry><entry><author><name>Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency</name></author><title>There&apos;s Lots to Sing About!</title><link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1049619&amp;tp=1\"></link><updated>2016-04-11T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1049619&amp;tp=1</id><summary type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\"><![CDATA[For well over a decade, Music PEI, the music industry association for Prince Edward Island, has been organizing and hosting popular music events that are locally staged and attract international attention.
