Only later did his family learn that his digestive issues were related to his opiate abuse and withdrawal.</p>\n                <p>He suddenly came back home to Buffalo Grove, Ill., about a four-hour drive from his school, a few weeks before finals during his sophomore year at Western Illinois University.&#160;</p>\n                <p>&#160;\u201cHe said he was being accused of stealing things and people were after him,\u201d Jody said. Delusions are a symptom of opioid abuse.</p>\n                <p>She noticed the physical symptoms too but still didn\u2019t realize how serious the situation was.&#160;</p>\n                <p>\u201cEven big change didn\u2019t hit me in the face until actually I found him in our home dead,\u201d Jody said.&#160;</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou feel like such a failure,\u201d Gary said. \u201cI used to go to wakes of people, kids, and callously just say, \u2018Where were the parents?\u2019 Now I\u2019m one of them that didn\u2019t think it was serious enough or know what to look for.\u201d\n</p>\n                <h2>A Life of Advocacy</h2>\n                <p>\n</p>\n                <p>When Dold referenced&#160;Live4Lali's \"amazing work\" in helping get Lali's Law passed in Illinois, Gary patted Chelsea on the shoulder to acknowledge the effort&#160;that led them to that moment, watching the House consider enacting a law named after their son and brother, was all hers.</p>\n                <p>\"It's unbelievable where we are today,\" Gary said. He said he was amazed that Chelsea's advocacy work led them to Washington and allowed them to meet Speaker Paul D. Ryan and stand up with him and House GOP leaders as they talked about the legislative effort to combat&#160;opioid abuse. &#160;</p>\n                <p>Lali's Law is one of <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/house-takes-turn-tackling-opioid-epidemic\">18 opioid-related measures </a>the House is considering this week. Other proposals would allow patients to only partially fill opioid prescriptions, require the Food and Drug Administration to work with expert advisory committees before approving opioid products and drug labels and expand residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum opioid addicts.</p>\n                <p>On Friday, the bills the House passes will be packaged and amended into the <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/senate_easily_passes_bill_addressing_opioid_abuse-246269-1.html\">Senate-passed&#160;Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA)</a>. The&#160;two chambers will then form a conference committee to work out their differences on the legislation.</p>\n                <p>Live4Lali started \"as a glorified barbecue,\" Gary said, explaining how a few weeks after Alex died,&#160;the family organized a fundraiser based around Frisbee golf, one of Alex's hobbies.&#160;</p>\n                <p>They raised&#160;$6,000 in the first year to provide intramural sports scholarships to kids who couldn't afford it.&#160;</p>\n                <p>Chelsea, who was 23 when her brother died and had organized most of the initial fundraisers, eventually quit her job and turned the nonprofit into&#160;a full-time advocacy organization seeking to prevent and raise awareness about substance abuse.&#160;</p>\n                <p>Live4Lali pushed Lali's Law through the statehouse in Illinois, overcoming a gubernatorial veto. The organization enlisted Dold to push a similar measure at the federal level.&#160;</p>\n                <p>The House had been expected to pass the bill via voice vote Wednesday, but a roll call vote was ordered so final passage will not occur until Thursday. Dold said he expects the bill to pass with overwhelming support.&#160;</p>\n                <p>\"This is all in honor of Alex,\" he said.&#160;</p>\n                <p>\n    <em>\n        <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/house-takes-turn-tackling-opioid-epidemic\">[Related:&#160;Finally, House Action on Opioids]</a>\n    </em>\n</p>\n                <p>Dold said 36 states and the District of Columbia already have standing orders to allow pharmacies to sell naloxone, sometimes referred to by its brand name Narcan, over the counter. Lali's Law would provide up to $500,000 per state to ensure the remaining states follow suit.&#160;</p>\n                <p>\"Oftentimes,\" Dold said, \"what happens is states right now, they say, 'Listen, I'd love to be able to roll it out. We don't have the resources to roll it out.' We want to take away that excuse.\"</p>\n                <p>\n    <em>Contact McPherson at lindseymcpherson@rollcall.com and follow her on Twitter @lindsemcpherson.&#160;</em>\n</p>\n                <p>\n    <strong>\n        <em>Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roll-call-news/id433753469?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">on your iPhone</a> or your <a title=\"click to view in a new window/tab\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devaary.cqrc.rollcall.v01&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>.</em>\n    </strong>\n</p>\n            </content:encoded>\n            <category>congressional-affairs  health-care  house </category>\n            <dc:creator>Lindsey McPherson</dc:creator>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:31:22 EST</pubDate>\n            <guid>9b3b0743998a7f973a8f7e97914b305d</guid>\n            <link>http://www.rollcall.com/news/familys-tragedy-turns-push-opioid-bill</link>\n            <author>lindseymcpherson@cqrollcall.com</author>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>Trump's Charm Offensive Impresses Senate GOP</title>\n            <description>Positive and productive \u2014&#160;that's how Senate Republican&#160;leaders described their meeting on Thursday with their party's presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump. \n Trump met with top Senate Republicans for more than an hour, and&#160;discussed the tone of his campaign and his effect on the GOP's competitive Senate races.</description>\n            <content:encoded>\n                <p>Positive and productive \u2014&#160;that's how Senate Republican&#160;leaders described their meeting on Thursday with their party's presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump.</p>\n                <p>Trump met with top Senate Republicans for more than an hour, and&#160;discussed the tone of his campaign and his effect on the GOP's competitive Senate races.</p>\n                <p>Before the meeting, Trump reached out to one of his most vocal critics with a phone call Wednesday.\n</p>\n                <p class=\"p1\">Sen.

Though Speaker Paul D.

Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., offered an amendment to include $600 million in <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/democrats-want-emergency-cash-fight-opioid-abuse/\">emergency funding</a> but it was rejected. Republicans argued that the fiscal 2016 omnibus appropriations measure included $400 million for opioid-specific programs that can be used this year and that additional funds can be appropriated for fiscal 2017 and beyond.&#160;</p>\n                <h2>Open to spending more?</h2>\n                <p>\n</p>\n                <p>Republicans are open to spending more money on opioid abuse prevention and treatment programs if the money&#160;is&#160;offset with spending cuts elsewhere.</p>\n                <p>Both the House and Senate measures provide authorization but not appropriations for millions in new or expanded&#160;grant programs, overseen by the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services.&#160;</p>\n                <p>Treatment providers said they are thrilled that Congress is focused on the issue, but can't yet tell how effective the final legislation might be.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis is the most legislation that has been evaluated, and possibly passed, in the history of addiction,\u201d said R.&#160;Corey Waller, chairman of the legislative advocacy committee at the American Society of Addiction Medicine. \u201cBut we know we have a small window to get it right, and we really want to get it right.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Treatment providers praised a measure that would make it easier for women to get addiction treatment while they are pregnant or immediately after giving birth. They also said that both House and Senate bills appeared to improve standardization of training for medical professionals who treat addiction and to recognize that nurse practitioners and physicians assistants play important roles in that process.</p>\n                <p>But Kelly Clark, president elect of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and others also expressed concern about a watering down of what they said was one of the most significant parts of the bill: a proposed expansion of the number of patients providers can treat with buprenorphine, a mild narcotic that helps prescription opioid and heroin addicts cope with the symptoms of withdrawal. &#160;</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the piece that\u2019s most likely to help decrease the death rate now,\u201d Clark said.</p>\n                <p>Federal regulations currently prohibit doctors from treating more than 100 patients with buprenorphine. One House bill, &#160;(<a href=\"http://www.cq.com/bill/114/HR4981\">\n        <strong>HR 4981</strong>\n    </a>), &#160;would have raised the cap from 100 patients to 250.</p>\n                <p>But a preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found that this change would have cost taxpayers $750 million over 10 years due to the increased number of beneficiaries under Medicare, Medicaid and military health care. Lawmakers have yet to agree on&#160;offsets to cover the expense.</p>\n                <p>If Congress fails to raise the cap, it will still likely go up. The administration has authority to unilaterally raise the cap and has proposed to bring it up to 200.</p>\n                <p>\n    <em>Andrew Siddons contributed to this report.&#160;</em>\n</p>\n                <p>\n    <em>Contact McPherson at lindseymcpherson@rollcall.com and follow her on Twitter @lindsemcpherson.&#160;</em>\n</p>\n                <p>\n    <em>Contact Akin at <a href=\"mailto:stephanieakin@cqrollcall.com\">stephanieakin@cqrollcall.com</a> and follow her on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephanieakin\">@stephanieakin</a>.</em>\n</p>\n                <p>\n    <strong>\n        <em>Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roll-call-news/id433753469?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">on your iPhone</a> or your <a title=\"click to view in a new window/tab\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devaary.cqrc.rollcall.v01&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>.</em>\n    </strong>\n</p>\n            </content:encoded>\n            <category>congressional-affairs  health-care  house  policy </category>\n            <dc:creator>Lindsey McPherson</dc:creator>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:15:13 EST</pubDate>\n            <guid>198bfc12ed3d620b8e78944ee655eaa3</guid>\n            <link>http://www.rollcall.com/news/house-takes-turn-tackling-opioid-epidemic</link>\n            <author>lindseymcpherson@cqrollcall.com</author>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>White House Not Losing Sleep Over Trump-GOP Meetings</title>\n            <description>The White House reacted to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s meetings with GOP&#160;congressional leaders with \u201csome amusement.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone here who\u2019s going to lose sleep over this meeting,\u201d Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, referring to the White House.</description>\n            <content:encoded>\n                <p>The White House reacted to presumptive Republican presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/now-words-paul-ryan-donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s meetings with GOP&#160;congressional leaders with \u201csome amusement.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone here who\u2019s going to lose sleep over this meeting,\u201d Press Secretary <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/whats-name-lot-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Earnest</a> told reporters, referring to the White House.</p>\n                <p>White House officials find it telling that although Speaker <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/republicans-trump-visit-dont-want-talk\" target=\"_blank\">Paul D.

The ruling sets up a showdown at the appeals court that will test the boundaries of separation of powers and when the courts can step into disputes between the branches of government.</p>\n                <p>U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer entered a judgment in favor of the House in the lawsuit that stops the use of certain funds to reimburse insurers under a section of the law. Collyer put that injunction on hold, however, pending an appeal that the Obama administration is certain to file.</p>\n                <p>The ruling represents a victory for the Republican-led House, which has tried to strike down the law since it was enacted. But the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the law and numerous efforts to repeal it legislatively have stalled.</p>\n                <p>The Obama administration has said the law is here to stay.</p>\n                <p>White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said critics continue to \"go through the motions.\" He said they \"have been losing this fight for six years. They will lose again.\"</p>\n                <p>The dispute focuses on two sections of the health care law. The administration said it could make Section 1402 Offset Program payments from the same account as Section 1401 Refundable Tax Credit Program payments. House Republicans say the health care law, known as the Affordable Care Act, doesn't permit that.</p>\n                <p>The Obama administration, during the fiscal 2014 appropriations process, initially asked Congress for a separate line item for 1402 payments. Congress did not include money for such a line item. The House then filed the lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Treasury, along with the secretaries of those agencies.</p>\n                <p>Collyer ruled that Section 1402 can\u2019t be funded through the same, permanent appropriation that Section 1401 is funded through.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe Affordable Care Act unambiguously appropriates money for Section 1401 premium tax credits but not for Section 1402 reimbursements to insurers. Such an appropriation cannot be inferred,\u201d Collyer wrote in the ruling. \u201cNone of Secretaries\u2019 extra-textual arguments \u2014 whether based on economics, \u2018unintended\u2019 results, or legislative history \u2014 is persuasive.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Collyer did not accept the Obama administration\u2019s argument that reading the two sections with different appropriations would yield \"absurd economic, fiscal and healthcare-policy results.\" The only result of the law is that Section 1402 must be funded annually, Collyer wrote.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFar from absurd, that is a perfectly valid means of appropriation,\u201d Collyer wrote. \u201cThe results predicted by the Secretaries flow not from the ACA, but from Congress\u2019 subsequent refusal to appropriate money.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>\n                <p>The Obama administration had already moved to take the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on a previous ruling in the case. The Justice Department lawyers disagreed with Collyer\u2019s decision early in the case that the House had the legal right to sue the Obama administration, arguing that ruling was \u201ca momentous step\u201d that unnecessarily plunges the judiciary into a dispute between the political branches.</p>\n                <p>John T.

Instead he was remembering the loss of two colleagues from D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, Jason E. White and Henry \"Hank\" Daly. And he was thinking about the legacy of those losses: A loving marriage and a bright&#160;and&#160;caring 20-year-old daughter, Emma.</p>\n                <p>Trugman, 63, and his wife, Kristan Trugman, 52, the director of internal communications for the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms, met in 1994 because White was killed on Capitol Hill. They sealed their bond after another deadly shooting later that year, this one killing Daly and two FBI officers at police headquarters.</p>\n                <p>This week, as law enforcement officers stream into Washington for National Police Week memorial events, Neil and Kristan Trugman are facing a complicated set of emotions. They understand \u2014&#160;and embrace \u2014&#160;the fact that two terrible tragedies led to their rich life together.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPolice Week is a special time,\u201d Neil said. \u201cI do think of Hank and Jason almost every day, but this is a time to reflect and think about where they are today and to assure they are never forgotten. Part of my reflection is to realize how these tragedies gave birth to such a wonderful family.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI do think about Jason a lot even though I never knew him,\u201d Kristan said. \u201cBut because of him, I have an amazing family and life. I think during Police Week when surrounded by survivors that it brings home again the huge impact on so many lives that occurs from a police officer losing his or her life in the line of duty. It takes a very special person to be willing every day to go to work to put their lives at risk for people they don\u2019t even know \u2014&#160;us.\u201d\n</p>\n                <h3>\n    <strong>A courthouse meeting</strong>\n</h3>\n                <p>\n</p>\n                <p>Neil and Kristan first spotted each other in U.S. District Court in Washington in January 1994.</p>\n                <p>Both were in a courtroom for a pre-trial hearing for the man accused of killing White. Neil, then a D.C. detective, thought Kristan was cute. Kristan Strother, then a reporter for The Washington Times, thought Neil looked like the epitome of a detective.</p>\n                <p>The hearing was one of the first court proceedings in the government\u2019s case against Donzell M. McCauley, who was accused of gunning down White on Dec. 30, 1993.</p>\n                <p>White had been on patrol on the eastern edge of Capitol Hill with his partner when he tried to question McCauley.</p>\n                <p>McCauley put up his palms, declaring \u201cI\u2019m \u201ctired of y\u2019all (bleeping) with me,\u201d and walking onto the small porch of a row house, Trugman said. White followed.</p>\n                <p>McCauley suddenly pivoted, pulled a handgun and fired a shot into White\u2019s bullet-resistant vest, knocking the officer down the steps head-first. He then stood over White and fired several shots into his head.</p>\n                <p>White's partner was able to provide a detailed description of the gunman, and police later captured McCauley. Detectives found 13 packets of crack in his underwear. McCauley pleaded guilty to killing White in July 1995, and was sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n                <p>After the initial hearing in federal court, Kristan returned to the nearby D.C. Superior Court, where she had a small office across the hall from the police liaison office. She left her door open.</p>\n                <p>Neil saw her in the office, walked in to introduce himself, and chatted her up. \u201cHe talked a lot about his kids,\u201d Kristan recalled. Neil was divorced, and spent a lot of time with his children.</p>\n                <p>Neil spotted a photo on Kristan\u2019s desk \u2014 \u201cMy husband,\u201d&#160;she&#160;said. \u201cHe seemed a bit deflated by that,\u201d Kristan recalls. Neil left his business card. The two remained cordial whenever they saw each other in the courthouse.</p>\n                <p>Months later, Kristan, who\u2019d separated from her husband by then, called up Neil to ask him out for a drink. \u201cI don\u2019t drink,\u201d Neil told her before he hung up.</p>\n                <p>Neil\u2019s partner of 17 years, Detective Greg Peterson, looked at Neil, slack-jawed. \u201cYou eat, don\u2019t you?\u201d Peterson said. \u201cCall her back.\u201d Neil did. He met Kristan at the Hawk \u2018n\u2019 Dove, and they went to a nearby Greek restaurant for dinner. They hit it off. \u201cWe talked about non-work things,\u201d Kristan said.</p>\n                <p>Other dates followed. They saw \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d at the Uptown Theater, then hit an ice cream parlor. They went to a sports bar in Alexandria, where Neil \u2014&#160;a Brooklyn native \u2014&#160;rooted for the New York Giants as they squared off against Kristan\u2019s team, the Dallas Cowboys.\n</p>\n                <h3>\n    <strong>A Second Shooting</strong>\n</h3>\n                <p>\n</p>\n                <p>The nascent romance was proceeding slowly. Then a gangster shot up the cold case office of MPD\u2019s homicide division in November 1994.</p>\n                <p>At her office at D.C. Superior Court that afternoon, Kristan saw dozens of D.C. police officers suddenly race out of the building, their hand-held radios squawking. Neil was in front of MPD headquarters, walking to his car after working an early shift, when he heard a lieutenant\u2019s voice on his hand-held radio cry out, \u201cShots fired on the third floor!\u201d The homicide office.</p>\n                <p>Neil ran into the building, up a stairwell to the third floor, and smelled gun smoke coming from the cold case office. Neil joined two fellow MPD officers at a heavy wooden door leading into the office, where he listened as FBI Agent John David Kuchta, who was gravely wounded, identified himself and asked for help. Neil knew that the door was too sturdy to break without a battering ram. \u201cReach up and slide the bolt!\u201d he told the agent.</p>\n                <p>Kuchta was able to open the door and eventually survived. Hank Daly and two FBI agents were killed.</p>\n                <p>A few hours later, Neil and a team of D.C. officers and FBI agents conducted a raid at the Northeast Washington home where the gunman, Bennie Lawson Jr., 22, lived with his father. Inside the home, Neil found a notebook in which Lawson had written rap-like lyrics, some of which said, \u201cCaptain Hennessy must die!\u201d Captain William \u201cLou\u201d Hennessy, the homicide commander, had interrogated Lawson a few weeks earlier about a triple homicide.</p>\n                <p>Kristan had pitched in covering the headquarters attack and was unwinding at the Hawk \u2018n\u2019 Dove with colleagues when she saw a TV news report about the raid at the Lawson home. She saw Neil coming out of the house.</p>\n                <p>When Neil called her that night to ask if he could see her, Kristan responded \u2014&#160;not quite jokingly: \u201cOnly if you tell me what y\u2019all found.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Neil responded with silence. The question struck a nerve; Daly, who died in the attack, had been a friend and a mentor. Neil respected the job journalists did, but had never been a source for one, and had kept his work life separate from Kristan\u2019s.</p>\n                <p>They didn\u2019t see each other that night, and Neil decided he would break up with Kristan. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to fend off questions from a reporter who was also my girlfriend,\u201d he said.</p>\n                <p>But the next time he saw Kristan, she apologized. \u201cI didn\u2019t take into account that you were friends with [Daly],\u201d she said. \u201cThat was insensitive. That\u2019s not the person I want to be. You\u2019re more important than this job.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The following month, Neil\u2019s father, Morris \u201cMoe\u201d Trugman, became gravely ill with a heart ailment and was hospitalized. He died in March 1995. Kristan accompanied Neil to the funeral.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe understood me,\u201d Neil said. \u201cShe was with me in the worst of times, and the best of times.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Their daughter Emma was born in March 1996, and Neil and Kristan married the following October.\n</p>\n                <h3>\n    <strong>&#160;A Life Together</strong>\n</h3>\n                <p>\n</p>\n                <p>In the mid-1990s, a group of Capitol Hill residents raised money for a plaque honoring White in the children\u2019s playground at Marion Park, which is across the street from the 1st&#160;district police substation at 4th&#160;and D Streets SE. Kristan\u2019s parents, who lived nearby, would often take the toddler Emma to the playground.</p>\n                <p>Neil\u2019s and Kristan\u2019s career paths eventually brought both of them to Capitol Hill. Having retired from the MPD, Neil joined the&#160;Capitol Police as an intelligence research specialist in 2004. Amtrak hired him in January 2006. As deputy chief, Neil is responsible for&#160;counter-terrorism intelligence, the canine unit, and special operations.</p>\n                <p>Kristan left her newspaper job in 2000, and has worked as a senior policy analyst for the police department, chief of staff for the U.S. Capitol Police and a special assistant to former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terry Gainer, whom she considers a mentor. She was appointed director of the office of internal communications for the Senate in 2012.</p>\n                <p>For years, Neil wouldn\u2019t celebrate his April 29 birthday, because it was the same birthday as White\u2019s. Kristan\u2019s tag number on her personal car \u2014&#160;3887 \u2014&#160;is White\u2019s badge number. On Sunday, as she has since 1998, Kristan will volunteer on behalf of Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS), helping to provide day care for family members of officers killed in the line of duty while they participate in Police Week activities.</p>\n                <p>This summer, their daughter Emma, a student at the University of Delaware who rides horses competitively, will have a chance to learn about the city crime that brought her parents together. She will work as an intern with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n                <p>\n    <em>Ruben Castaneda is a freelance journalist and author of S Street Rising: Crack, Murder, and Redemption in DC.

Anthony List</a> took the unprecedented step Wednesday of endorsing the male opponent of Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the group. SBAL is dedicated to electing GOP women who oppose abortion rights, and has never endorsed a man over a pro-life woman in a Republican primary.</p>\n                <p>But last year, Ellmers infuriated some anti-abortion activists when she <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/218/what-the-house-gops-abortion-bill-about-face-really-means/\">helped stall a House bill</a> that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks. Now, Dannenfelser\u2019s group is bending its own rules to exact revenge.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really an effective political organization if you can\u2019t respond to the derailment of your number one priority,\u201d Dannenfelser said. &#160;</p>\n                <p>The anti-abortion leader wants her group\u2019s action to resonate among all social conservative leaders, who she believes aren\u2019t focused enough on punishing \u2013 and rewarding \u2013 lawmakers in their elections.</p>\n                <p>That lack of electoral involvement was evident across the GOP primary map this year, where social conservative groups failed to seriously challenge Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman after he announced his <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/will-pro-lgbt-stands-hurt-gop-senators\">support for same-sex marriage</a>. Or in Tennessee, where the primary opponent to Republican Rep. Scott DesJarlais has yet to earn the support of social conservative groups despite the incumbent congressman\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-abortion-groups-ignored-the-man-they-hate/436164/\">checkered personal history</a>.</p>\n                <p>[<em>\n        <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/social-conservative-groups-steer-clear-gop-primaries\">Related: Anti-Abortion Groups Aren't Punishing Republican Betrayals</a>\n    </em>]</p>\n                <p>Social conservative groups had avoided challenging Ellmers, too, before federal courts ordered a redrawn congressional map in North Carolina. But Dannenfelser said Ellmers' new opponent in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Congressional District, Rep. George Holding, made the opportunity to oppose her more enticing.\n</p>\n                <h2>\n    <strong>Example to Follow</strong>\n</h2>\n                <p>\n</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s an example, she said, more social conservative groups need to follow. Otherwise, they will continue to lose major legislative battles on Capitol Hill.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere is no short and swift reaction to bad votes, and there is no short and swift reaction to people who need our help,\u201d Dannenfelser said. \u201cWithout that political arm, without that discipline, we will continue to lose.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dannenfelser said social conservative groups don\u2019t weigh in more on electoral politics because many of them are focused on talking to voters about issues, not on which candidate to support or oppose. Groups are so used to that approach \u2013 which includes raising money through nonprofit organizations \u2013 that it\u2019s difficult to adjust. &#160;</p>\n                <p>\"There\u2019s a ton of education, a ton of legal work, a lot of people who really believe, but where is the outward political expression of that?\" she asked. \"It\u2019s simply not there.\"</p>\n                <p>Ellmers faces a difficult re-election fight in her state\u2019s 2<sup>nd</sup> District, where she is running against Holding and obstetrician Greg Brannon. The support of Susan B. Anthony List could prove important in a tight race, especially given its focus on an issue of visceral importance to the conservative base.</p>\n                <p>[<em>\n        <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/renee-ellmers-primary-fight-life\">Related: The Rise (and probable fall) of Renee Ellmers</a>\n    </em>]</p>\n                <p>Dannenfelser said SBAL will target 12,000 pro-life voters with phone calls and personal visits from hundreds of canvassers.</p>\n                <p>Anti-abortion activists are angry with Ellmers because of her role in stalling a bill in January of 2015 that would have banned abortions at 20-weeks, except in cases of rape, incest, and if the life of the mother were in danger. &#160;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/abortion-bill-rape-victims-114324\">Ellmers reportedly objected</a> to provision in the legislation that would require rape victims to report the crime within 48 hours of its occurrence.\n</p>\n                <h2>\n    <strong>Ellmers Responds</strong>\n</h2>\n                <p>\n</p>\n                <p>Ellmers, who says she opposes abortion rights, has a perfect voting record this congressional session, according to a scorecard <a href=\"http://nrlc.capwiz.com/bio/id/12188\">from the National Right to Life</a>.&#160;</p>\n                <p>An official with her campaign defended the congresswoman's abortion rights record, pointing out that she voted for the 20-week ban&#160;when it came up for a vote in May of 2015.&#160;Even if she objected to provisions in the original legislation in January, she hardly had the authority to single-handily prevent it from being voted on, said Patrick Sebastian, senior adviser&#160;for the campaign. &#160;</p>\n                <p>\"She never once voted against a&#160;pro-life bill,\" Sebastian said. \"It's absurd, honestly.\"</p>\n                <p>He criticized the leaders of Susan B.

Donald Trump and Paul Ryan will come together.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Collins told reporters that he was \"very optimistic\" that Ryan would support Trump. Collins was one of several Trump supporters who met with Ryan Wednesday, ahead of Thursday's meeting.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat [Ryan] said very clearly is 'I don\u2019t know the man, I\u2019ve never met the man.

Ryan of Wisconsin and the House Republican leadership, and then with Senate Republican leaders in an effort to find common ground.</p>\n                <p>Trump and Ryan issued a joint statement after their meeting saying they still had differences, but that they had a constructive discussion and pledged to work together to unite the Republican Party this fall.</p>\n                <p>The Cruz blueprint calls for slashing tax rates across the board for individuals and corporations, including a plan to streamline the seven individual tax rates into a single 10-percent flat tax. The individual tax rates now range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent. He also would create a 16 percent business transfer tax, similar to a business consumption tax, which would replace the 35 percent corporate tax rate and payroll taxes.</p>\n                <p>Although he is not a tax writer on the Finance Committee, Cruz has worked in recent months on a range of issues with allies such as Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Republican Steering Committee.</p>\n                <p>[Related: <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/return-ted-cruz\">Back in D.C., Cruz Won't Extinguish Presidential Hopes</a>]</p>\n                <p>Cruz said he would prod the GOP to emphasize incentives for economic growth as an alternative to liberal proposals for dealing with income inequality, such as increased federal spending and new mandates such as a higher minimum wage.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA point that I made frequently on the campaign trail is that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton often bring up income inequality. Income inequality has increased dramatically under their policies,\" Cruz said. \"The rich have gotten richer under big government.\"</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why my No. 1 priority if I had been elected president \u2014 and my No. 1 priority here in the Senate is fighting for jobs and economic growth because the people who are benefited the most are the most vulnerable. It\u2019s young people, Hispanics, African Americans, single moms, it\u2019s the working men and women of America,\u201d Cruz said.</p>\n                <p>He said he was looking for ways to advance his ideas in bills, amendments and potential add-ons to the GOP campaign agenda and the party platform at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI am eager to advance free-market principles using any vehicle that is available. I\u2019ve said for a long time, my domestic political philosophy is opportunity conservatism. Every policy we think about and talk about should focus on easing the means of ascent up the economic ladder,\u201d he added.</p>\n                <p>[Related: <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/welcome-back-senate-ted-cruz\">Welcome Back to the Senate, Ted Cruz!</a>]</p>\n                <p>Cruz has voiced concerns since last year that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, and Ryan, his running mate, erred by emphasizing efforts to help taxpayers on the upper half of the income scale, without focusing enough on those on the lower end of the economic ladder.</p>\n                <p>Seth Masket, a political science professor at the University of Denver, said Cruz\u2019s efforts to advance his priorities could be part of a broader strategy for mending fences with colleagues while also preparing for a return to the presidential campaign trail, possibly in 2020. Cruz on Wednesday filed paperwork in Texas to seek re-election to his Senate seat in 2018.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe may be interested in making amends and perhaps working on some legislation with colleagues. It would work to improve his image, either setting him up for a more productive career in the Senate or possibly for another run president,\u201d Masket said.</p>\n                <p>Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University, said Cruz would need to woo Republican colleagues in order to move legislation -- which could be a challenge because of his reputation for objecting to bills on the floor and helping to instigate the 2013 government shutdown.</p>\n                <p>He said Cruz likely was aiming to try to shoehorn some of his ideas into the 2016 Republican platform, with the help of supportive delegates to the GOP convention, who are seeking seats on the party's platform committee.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere is an opportunity to influence the economic planks in that platform,\u201d Jillson said.</p>\n                <p>As for securing legislative trophies, Jillson said Cruz would need to find more allies willing to second his procedural motions on the floor, and back his proposals.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to pick a few major issue areas in which he can visibly begin to develop expertise. And he has to work cooperatively with his colleagues. If he doesn\u2019t support them, that\u2019s not going to engender the kind of reciprocity that he needs,\u201d Jillson said.</p>\n                <p>\n    <strong>\n        <em>Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roll-call-news/id433753469?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">on your iPhone</a> or your <a title=\"click to view in a new window/tab\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devaary.cqrc.rollcall.v01&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>.</em>\n    </strong>\n</p>\n            </content:encoded>\n            <category>2016  budget  elections  gop-brand  policy  presidential-race  republicans  senate </category>\n            <dc:creator>Alan Ota</dc:creator>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:05:35 EST</pubDate>\n            <guid>065c6ae08df635a6a78498c4d0384f24</guid>\n            <link>http://www.rollcall.com/news/ted-cruz-back-wants-lower-taxes</link>\n            <author>aota@cq.com</author>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>Poll: Republican Voters Side With Trump Over Ryan</title>\n            <description>As House Speaker Paul D.

USA! USA!\" will punctuate the soundtrack to the Rio Olympics in August, unless Budweiser also copyrights \"USA!\" beer.</p>\n                <p>And, on a far more serious plane, Barack Obama's recently announced&#160; visit to Hiroshima at the end of the month has revived the 70-year debate over America's decision to drop the A-bomb.</p>\n                <p>As an American who made the pilgrimage to Hiroshima and Nagasaki when I was on a Japan Society fellowship in the early 1990s, I understand the awkward feelings of responsibility about being a citizen of the only nation that has ever deployed nuclear weapons in wartime.</p>\n                <p>A quarter century ago, the English-language signage in both cities glossed over Pearl Harbor and Japanese atrocities to make it appear like World War II had begun with the fire bombing of Tokyo in March 1945. Without context, Harry Truman's decision to obliterate Hiroshima and then Nagasaki almost seemed like a crazed whim.</p>\n                <p>As galling as Japanese denial was around the time of the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, the horrors of August 1945 remained inescapable. I recall being accompanied to a Hiroshima Carp baseball game by an English-speaking team official. As we were leaving the stadium, he felt compelled to tell me about being a small boy in Hiroshima on that fateful day. I still get chills when I remember his suddenly quavering voice repeating words like \"fire ... running ... scared ... mother ...\"</p>\n                <p>Even though I read many histories, I have yet to decide whether the first atomic strike on Hiroshima was justified. (Nagasaki three days later remains far more troubling). Had there been an invasion of Japan, my late father, Cpl. Salem Shapiro, probably would have been part of it. And who knows whether I would exist today.</p>\n                <p>[Related: <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/nuclear_visions_and_nuclear_budgets_commentary-239918-1.html\">Nuclear Visions and Nuclear Budgets</a>]</p>\n                <p>Obama, as the White House has stressed, is not going to Hiroshima to apologize for an event that occurred 16 years before he was born. Instead as the first sitting president to visit the atomic-bomb site, Obama will be saying, in effect, \"Never again.\"</p>\n                <p>For all the wrenching agony of places like Syria, for all the billions who live near starvation, for all the looming threats from global warming, it remains amazing that no nation has resorted to nuclear weapons in 71 years. We have survived the Cuban Missile Crisis, hair-trigger threats between India and Pakistan and, most recently, an irrational dictator in North Korea with an atomic stockpile. &#160;</p>\n                <p>As a baby boomer born in the same year (1947) as Hillary Clinton, my entire life has been spent in the shadow of The Bomb. Whether it was clutching my neck as I cowered under my deck in duck-and-cover drills in elementary school or attending ban-the-bomb rallies at the United Nations as a teen, I never could fully escape the awareness that everything I knew and cherished could vanish in a thermonuclear instant.</p>\n                <p>These worries did not automatically vanish with the greatest public event of my lifetime \u2014 the 1989 destruction of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War.</p>\n                <p>Even now I can reconstruct in my mind a scene-by-scene recap of \"On the Beach,\" the 1959 nuclear war movie starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and a non-dancing Fred Astaire. Its harrowing plot describes the last months of life in Australia as the deadly cloud of radioactive fallout drifts ever closer.</p>\n                <p>Maybe these embedded mushroom cloud nightmares explain why I have trouble understanding the climate of fear that overhangs the 2016 election. According to an early March Gallup Poll, 48 percent of Americans \"worry a great deal\" about \"the possibility of future terrorist attacks in the U.S.\" In contrast, I live in Manhattan \u2014 and I rarely think about terrorism.</p>\n                <p>[Related: <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/poll-low-confidence-in-leaders-dealing-with-terror\">Poll: Low Confidence in Leaders Dealing With Terrorism</a>]</p>\n                <p>Since the Twin Towers were toppled by Osama bin Laden's disciples nearly 15 years ago, America probably has been the safest major country in the world. This is not an argument for a lack of vigilance. But it does raise the question of why roughly half of American adults in a December 2015 Gallup Poll said they are nervous that they or their loved ones will be a victim of terrorism.</p>\n                <p>With his tough-guy bravado, Donald Trump offers the comforting illusion that he will keep the nation secure unlike the lame losers who have run America since 9/11. At its core, this represents the authoritarian temptation \u2014 yielding to a Big Daddy in the White House who supposedly will allow you to sleep snug in your beds every night.</p>\n                <p>In reality, trusting Trump with the nuclear codes would be rolling dice with fate. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project, said that after witnessing the first atomic bomb test in the New Mexico desert, \"I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture ...'I became death, the destroyer of worlds.'\"</p>\n                <p>That is why Obama, who deserves credit for the nuclear deal with Iran, is taking the right step in visiting Hiroshima. No responsibility is greater for the president and other world leaders than assuring that no other nation will ever suffer the fate of Japan in 1945.

But the exception, by fits and starts, is growing ever less likely to be exceptional.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSentencing reform,\u201d as it\u2019s known on the Hill, is seriously stuck.</p>\n                <p>On the surface, it may not appear that way. Just offstage, there\u2019s a fundamental impasse that looks as if it can only be broken if one sitde caves in, thereby imperiling the highly unusual bipartisan coalition that has been the issue\u2019s signature feature.</p>\n                <p>Complicating matters further, there are solid presidential and congressional campaign rationales for a deal, but also political arguments in opposition being at least as forcefully expressed.</p>\n                <p>All this is on clearest display in the Senate, where the legislation looks to be riding a little wave of momentum but may be close to publicly coming off the rails \u2013 buffeted by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io9KMSSEZ0Y\">anxieties about Willie Horton</a> on the right and anger at Wall Street greed on the left.</p>\n                <p>Two weeks ago, an ideologically diverse group <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/banishing-ghost-willie-horton-promote-criminal-justice-reform\">announced revisions to the legislation</a> they described as almost guaranteeing passage with a filibuster-proof majority of more than 60 and most senators from both caucuses.</p>\n                <p>Its<a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/human-face-criminal-justice-overhaul\"> extraordinary roster of co-sponsors</a>, now 19 Democrats and 16 Republicans, ranges ideologically from unvarnished liberal Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland to libertarian tea party conservative Mike Lee of Utah. It includes both the whips, Republican John Cornyn of Texas and Democrat Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, along with a handful from each side getting mentioned in early vice-presidential speculation.</p>\n                <p>Maybe most telling, the only Senate Democrat in any re-election trouble this fall, Michael Bennet of Colorado, is a cosponsor and so are four of the six Republican incumbents in <a href=\"http://data.rollcall.com/raceratings/\">competitive campaigns</a>: Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Rob Portman of Ohio and Mark S. Kirk of Illinois.</p>\n                <p>The bill would ease the <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/convicted-republicans-plead-for-mandatory-minimums-changes\">mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines</a> for future nonviolent offenders (mostly drug criminals), allow many of those already incarcerated out of prison ahead of schedule and ease their path back into society and the workforce.</p>\n                <p>This exceptionally diverse group has decided that package is something they can stand behind as good social policy, law enforcement policy and budget policy. (Fewer federal inmates mean reduced prison expenses.) &#160;Members in tough races are also eager to distance themselves from the \u201cDo Nothing Congress\u201d label by getting their fingerprints on an understandable and tangible accomplishment.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s why there\u2019s a decent chance the bill will come to the floor this summer, assuming the appropriations process inevitably seizes up and there no longer is the need to devote the Senate\u2019s time to spending bills.</p>\n                <p>Along the way, the measure is going to face one assault from powerful Republicans determined to kill it outright, and another from Republicans willing to love it to death.</p>\n                <p>Ted Cruz of Texas, who <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/republicans-wait-ted-cruz-get-back-work\">returned to the Capitol this week</a> vowing to press ahead with the combative outsider tone of his presidential campaign, and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the first senator to endorse de facto GOP nominee Donald Trump, are leading the lambasting of the bill as going way too soft on crime.</p>\n                <p>A floor debate would give Cruz an opportunity to put his scorched-earth style for opposing legislation back on C-SPAN display. And though Trump has not taken an explicit position on the bill, his many authoritarian statements suggest he\u2019ll take Sessions\u2019 advice and come out emphatically against it \u2013 especially if his likely opponent, Hillary Clinton, who\u2019s become newly critical of \u201cmass incarceration,\u201d decides to endorse the bill.</p>\n                <p>So it\u2019s quite easy to envision law-and-order groups producing 30-second TV spots, evocative of the legendary Willie Horton ad from the 1988 presidential campaign, chiding even the GOP backers of the bill as pro-drug-dealer criminal justice weaklings.</p>\n                <p>The other big obstacle, which might prove even more problematic, goes by the much nerdier label, mens rea.</p>\n                <p>That Latin phrase, which translates as \u201cguilty mind,\u201d is law school shorthand for the way prosecutors are sometimes required to prove a defendant\u2019s criminal intent in order to obtain a conviction. Under federal law, many categories of behavior are crimes only when the accused know what they\u2019re doing is wrong and do it anyway \u2013 but some actions can bring convictions and imprisonment whether or not there\u2019s any willful criminal intent.</p>\n                <p>[<a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/criminal-justice-debate-turns-much-possible\">\n        <em>\n            <strong>Related: Criminal; Justice Debate Turns to How Much Is Possible</strong>\n        </em>\n    </a>]</p>\n                <p>Many influential Republicans, urged on by their business allies and such conservative fundraising forces as the Koch brothers, are eager to apply a blanket mens rea requirement across the federal criminal code. They say the government has too much power to convict companies and their executives without having to prove any criminal intent. And they are eyeing the sentencing overhaul bill as their best available vehicle for getting the job done.</p>\n                <p>Lawmakers and activists from the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party deride this proposal as a thinly veiled effort to deliver a permission slip for more \u201cWhat, me worry?\u201d sketchy behavior to the same sort of bad actors in the corporate and investment worlds who melted down the economy eight years ago. These liberal forces, too, have the ability to produce punchy campaign commercials targeting those in Congress who go along.</p>\n                <p>Even if the bill gets through the Senate without having to swallow the mens rea poison pill, top Republicans in the House are insisting that sentencing legislation will only move if it\u2019s lashed together with their efforts to expand the need to prove criminal intent. The Obama administration argues the opposite, that the only way to sign a bill on sentencing this year is to negotiate protections for unwitting white collar criminals on a separate track.</p>\n                <p>One again this campaign season, it\u2019s the small clusters of combative voices at the edges that are likely to have more power than any collaborative majority in the middle.</p>\n                <p>\n    <strong>\n        <em>Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roll-call-news/id433753469?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">on your iPhone</a> or your <a title=\"click to view in a new window/tab\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devaary.cqrc.rollcall.v01&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>.</em>\n    </strong>\n</p>\n            </content:encoded>\n            <dc:creator>David Hawkings</dc:creator>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 04:00:51 EST</pubDate>\n            <guid>88935001ef8718446e1f99d68b2ddda4</guid>\n            <link>http://www.rollcall.com/news/serious-trouble-sentencing-bill</link>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>With Trump, Ryan Wins When It Looks Like He's Losing</title>\n            <description>House Speaker Paul Ryan will fold. \n When Ryan said he wasn\u2019t ready to endorse, Republican insiders told me it wasn\u2019t a sustainable position.

But neither will Trump have to wait until the convention. Ryan has made his point, and the two men can agree to make common cause in defeating Hillary Clinton without agreeing on policy, style or tactics. In the end, Ryan won\u2019t be much further from Trump than the rest of the GOP leadership.</p>\n                <p>\n    <em>\n        <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/trump-makes-life-harder-colorado-nevada-senate-candidates\">[Related: Trump Makes Life Harder for Colorado and Nevada Senate Candidates]</a>\n    </em>\n</p>\n                <p>What\u2019s different about Ryan, though, is that he will win when it looks like he\u2019s losing. He already has won.</p>\n                <p>After other Republicans either got trucked by Trump or simply signaled their subservience without a fight, Ryan stared him down.</p>\n                <p>When Sarah Palin said Ryan would get \"Cantored\" \u2014 taken out in a congressional primary by a no-name challenger like former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor \u2014 Trump quickly distanced himself from her. Take it as a sign of good judgment that, given a choice between the last two Republican vice presidential nominees, Trump chose not to defend the under-baked Alaskan.</p>\n                <p>Trump also reversed himself on Ryan. First, he threatened to remove Ryan as co-chairman of the Republican convention. Surely, Ryan hoped that threat was a promise. He responded by saying he\u2019d step aside willingly. And then Trump, understanding how bad it would look for him to replace the highest-ranking Republican in the land with anyone else, changed his mind.</p>\n                <p>Despite or because of Ryan\u2019s withheld support, Trump is starting to warm to him. In an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly this week, Trump called Ryan \"a very good man\" who \"wants what\u2019s good for the party.\"</p>\n                <p>\n    <em>\n        <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/podcast-gops-slow-embrace-trump-congress-tackles-opioid-epidemic\">[Related: Podcast: GOP's Slow Embrace of Trump]</a>\n    </em>\n</p>\n                <p>Ryan accomplished a few things here: He signaled to Trump, establishment Republicans and the general public that he\u2019s nobody\u2019s patsy or punching bag; he earned favor with his colleagues by giving them cover to take their own time on Trump; and he\u2019s reminded everyone \u2014 including Trump \u2014 that he\u2019s the guy who has actually united the party\u2019s factions at the federal level.</p>\n                <p>Trump now understands that Ryan has a real constituency and that messing with the House speaker would come at a price. He must also have concluded that the squeaky-clean Ryan is pretty impervious to the weapon Trump uses to destroy his foes: Character attack.\n&#160;\nUltimately, Ryan can\u2019t impede the party\u2019s nominee without doing serious damage to himself. The GOP voters who picked Trump wouldn\u2019t stand for that, and they\u2019d let their elected representatives \u2014 Ryan\u2019s constituency in the House \u2014 know about it. It would also make him toxic if he chooses to run for president in either 2020 or 2024.</p>\n                <p>The truth is neither man is powerful enough to knock the other out, and both would emerge from a fight bloodied and weakened.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s never really been any question about whether Ryan would get behind Trump. Instead, the questions are how, when and at what cost, if any, to Trump.</p>\n                <p>By swearing that he didn\u2019t want to become speaker, Ryan extracted concessions from his colleagues before taking the job. If his delay means he can get Trump to sign onto policy positions or even promise to comport himself in ways that don\u2019t hurt down-ballot GOP candidates, it would be a huge victory for Ryan.</p>\n                <p>&#160;<em>\n        <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/republicans-trump-visit-dont-want-talk\">[Related: Some Republicans Are Tired of Talking About Trump Visit]</a>\n    </em>\n</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine that Ryan \u2014 again, the highest-ranking Republican in the country \u2014 would skip the GOP convention that he is supposed to preside over. If he\u2019s there, he\u2019ll have to push for Trump\u2019s election. And, given the national attention to the convention, he\u2019ll have to do it with gusto or he\u2019ll look petty.</p>\n                <p>That leaves the matter of timing. The most comfortable fit for Ryan and other Republicans \u2014 long enough to show they\u2019re not crazy about Trump but early enough to avoid antagonizing true Trump believers \u2014is probably after the primary calendar is finished and before the convention.</p>\n                <p>Whenever Ryan gives in, he\u2019ll have done it with dignity, which is more than you can say for much of the rest of the Republican establishment. He\u2019s the only Republican so far to clash with Trump and live to tell about it.

While it's hard to imagine Marco Rubio, who has already <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/rubio-not-want-considered-vice-president\">ruled himself out</a> of consideration as Trump's vice president, accepting a lower post, who could have imagined him supporting&#160;Trump at all a few months ago? Walker&#160;too might be better&#160;considered as a running mate, though the Labor Department would be an excellent place to let his antipathy toward organized labor run wild.&#160;\n</p>\n                <h2>Probably Impossible, Still Worth Considering?</h2>\n                <figure id=\"attachment_11849\" style=\"width: 840px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n    <img class=\"wp-image-11849 size-large\" src=\"http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/author/2016/05/11163149/Untitled-4-04-1024x680.png\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Vladimir Putin, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, Voldemort, The Koch Brothers (Credit: CQ Roll Call, Getty Images)\" width=\"840\" height=\"558\"/>\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Clockwise from top left: Vladimir Putin, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, Voldemort, The Koch Brothers (Credit: CQ Roll Call, Getty Images)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n                <p>\n</p>\n                <p>It's probably not legal to have a pair of labor and treasury secretaries, though this respondent helpfully remarked that the Koch brothers would only serve at treasury after dissolving the Labor Department.

Grassley, R-Iowa, did not ask him to do so. Grassley has said repeatedly he won\u2019t hold confirmation hearings for President Barack Obama\u2019s pick to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>\n                <p>When Garland submitted his questionnaire and related documents \u2014 totaling 2,200 pages \u2014 on Tuesday, the White House used the occasion to ding Grassley for refusing to move the nomination. Senate Democrats pointed to boxes of paperwork at a news conference to illustrate Garland\u2019s extensive response to the questionnaire.</p>\n                <p>But Garland did not include a financial net worth statement as requested in Question 23. Obama\u2019s last two picks for the Supreme Court, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, both provided the net worth statement in their committee questionnaire, according to Government Printing Office records.</p>\n                <p>The White House helps judicial nominees fill out the questionnaire and routinely files the net worth information.</p>\n                <p>That information is generally considered the most sensitive and personal information a nominee must provide as part of the confirmation process. Judiciary Committee staff labeled Garland's questionnaire as \u201cincomplete\u201d on the committee website.</p>\n                <p>\n    <em>\n        <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/seven-things-learned-judge-garlands-questionnaire\">[Related: 7 Things Merrick Garland Has Told the Senate About Himself]</a>\n    </em>\n</p>\n                <p>The omission protects Garland\u2019s privacy as long as it appears Republicans will persist in not holding confirmation hearings. But it also could be seen as a way to prompt Republicans into unwittingly starting the confirmation process by asking for more information.</p>\n                <p>Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, did provide some financial information, listing his investments and trusts with ranges of value. That includes property in New York valued between $1 million and $5 million, as well as a Fidelity index fund and a Fidelity Contrafund each valued in that same range.</p>\n                <p>Missing, however, is a standard chart that itemizes in detail all assets \u2014 including those investments and real estate \u2014 and all liabilities for members of his household.</p>\n                <p>Sotomayor submitted that chart as part of her confirmation questionnaire in 2009. She listed a net worth of $740,053.

As a land use and environmental attorney, she said she found herself lured into lawmaking.</p>\n                <p>She won her first race to represent Tampa in a bruising campaign against\nDemocratic businesswoman Stacy Frank in 2010.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was an extremely contentious race. The Democratic Party had targeted that particular race as their No. 1 priority in Florida,\u201d Young said.</p>\n                <p>The two wrangled over hot-button issues, including Cuba, President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and gay rights, which Young opposed. And she advocated strict immigration laws.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen it comes to illegal immigration, we can\u2019t get tough enough,\u201d she said in a campaign video at the time. \u201cWe need the Arizona law here.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The \u201cArizona Law\u201d is a controversial measure that gives law enforcement, in certain instances, powers to demand proof of legal immigration.</p>\n                <p>Young also infuriated the LGBT community with last-minute mailers taking aim at Frank for supporting same-sex marriage and adoption by gay couples.</p>\n                <p>She garnered 56 percent of the vote and then was re-elected twice, running unopposed each time.</p>\n                <p>Young moved into the leadership ranks and then Florida House Speaker Steve Crisafulli chose her as majority leader.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe has the ability to be firm in her principles while still being able to find compromise with other members,\u201d he said.</p>\n                <p>She has sponsored more than 20 bills that became law.</p>\n                <p>Mark Pafford, the Democratic Leader in the Florida House, said he disagrees with Young on many issues, but appreciates her willingness to talk with her colleagues across the aisle and help to create a collegial atmosphere.</p>\n                <p>This year, Young\u2019s turning her sights to the Florida Senate and this time has a Democratic opponent, newly announced candidate Bob Buesing, a Tampa attorney. He has called her positions extreme and destructive.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI want to send kids to school. She wants to make sure they get guns when they get there,\u201d he said in an interview.</p>\n                <p>Young has voted for open-carry gun laws on college campuses. In 2010, she touted her support for gun rights with flyers showing her aiming a rifle.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere is ample proof that gun-free zones do not protect law-abiding citizens,\u201d Young said. \u201cInstead, they are often seen as an invitation to those that would do us harm, because they know they could not be stopped by a law-abiding gun owner.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Young also has joined others in the GOP in attacking Obama\u2019s efforts to normalize relations with Cuba.</p>\n                <p>The race may be close. District 18 was recently redrawn to make it almost evenly split between Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n                <p>&#160;</p>\n                <p>\n    <strong>\n        <em>Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roll-call-news/id433753469?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">on your iPhone</a> or your <a title=\"click to view in a new window/tab\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devaary.cqrc.rollcall.v01&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>.</em>\n    </strong>\n</p>\n            </content:encoded>\n            <category>2016  conservatives  elections  gop-brand  influential-women  politics  republicans </category>\n            <dc:creator>Elvina Nawaguna</dc:creator>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 13:28:09 EST</pubDate>\n            <guid>3c18920cc705f05366bef5dc67ebd4ac</guid>\n            <link>http://www.rollcall.com/news/dana-young-republican-force-florida</link>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>Do Search Engines Have Algorithms to Sway Voters?</title>\n            <description>While Facebook is taking heat for allegedly controlling how&#160;topics trend on the social media website, search engines like Google are being scrutinized on how their rankings of stories might sway voters. \n Some experts estimate that between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes could be shifted because of how&#160;search engines rank stories.
