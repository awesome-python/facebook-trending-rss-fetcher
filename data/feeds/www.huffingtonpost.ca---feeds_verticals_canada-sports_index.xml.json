Conservatively speaking, they will involve 1600 athletes from 28 countries competing in 15 disciplines.</p><br />\n\t<p>The spectacle is bound to be an eye-opener for sports fans in this part of the country.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;The whole integration into the greater Toronto fabric is very important,&quot; said Gaetan Tardif, the President of the Canadian Paralympic Committee. &quot;When people try Para Sport they inevitably remark on how tough it is but also how much fun it is. They end up wanting more of it.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>Catherine Gosselin-Depres, the Executive Director of Sport for CPC, echoed Tardif&apos;s optimism while pointing out that what happens on the various fields of play over the course of the eight day event really matters going forward.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;There&apos;s a lot at stake,&quot; she stressed. &quot;For the first time the Parapan Am&apos;s are direct qualifiers in every sport for the upcoming Paralympic Games in Rio. In many cases, you will have to win here just to get to Brazil.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>High expectations for home team</p><br />\n\t<p>The leaders of the 216 member home team are already trumpeting the intensity of the competition that lies ahead. It represents a distinct opportunity to showcase these athletes on familiar soil and to make an impact with Canadians of all ages.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;We want to be top three in the medal standings,&quot; said Canadian Chef de Mission Elisabeth Walker-Young. &quot;But I admit my nervousness is for these athletes. I know how much they give up and how much they put in.&quot; Assistant Chef de Mission Stephanie Dixon had no such trepidation. &quot;Our motto for these Games is pretty clear,&quot; she offered.</p><br />\n\t<p>Embodying this confident attitude, some may call it swagger, is the Boccia player chosen as flag bearer for the opening ceremony.</p><br />\n\t<p>A native of Montreal, Marco Dispaltro began his career as a wheelchair rugby player in 1993 and then took up wheelchair tennis only to find Boccia later in life. He won Paralympic bronze in doubles play at London 2012 with partner Josh Vander Vies.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;For sure I&apos;ll win that gold medal this time,&quot; Dispaltro declared. &quot;When you talk about high performance athletes and what it takes...well... I&apos;ve put in my 10,000 hours and then some. These are hard core athletes and rivals I&apos;m dealing with.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>Flag-bearer&apos;s spirit electric</p><br />\n\t<p>At one point during the press conference\u00a0where the Canadian flag was passed to Dispaltro by Josh Dueck, the sit-skier who carried it out of the closing ceremony at the Sochi 2014 Paralympics, a television reporter posed a direct question.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;Can you tell us how old you are sir?&quot; she queried.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;Forty-eight,&quot; he replied. &quot;My hero is Gordie Howe. Gordie played forever. You can think of me as the Gordie Howe of wheelchair sport.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>Dispaltro has Muscular Dystrophy and as he ages he loses mobility. This has necessitated his sporting evolution.\u00a0</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;The great thing about me is that I have a degenerative disease,&quot; he said disarmingly while prompting a chuckle from the large media gathering. &quot;It&apos;s allowed me to try many sports and it&apos;s been a fantastic odyssey. My advice to young people will always be to try stuff. Don&apos;t be afraid. If you fall down then pick yourself back up.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>When the formal announcements were finished the sizeable scrum hung on his every word.. He talked at great length about wanting to be difficult to play against, never giving in, and about his belief that this was the chance of a lifetime.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;It&apos;s in Canada,&quot; he said wide-eyed. &quot;For me it&apos;s amazing and the chance to be the flag-bearer is absolutely insane.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>Most of us left feeling we can&apos;t wait to see him play the game.</p> ]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/08/05/blue-bomber-qb-drew-willy_n_7940864.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Blue Bomber QB Drew Willy named CFL player of the week]]></title>\n      <author>CBC</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/08/05/blue-bomber-qb-drew-willy_n_7940864.html?utm_hp_ref=canada-sports&amp;ir=Canada+Sports</link>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 10:02:22 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<p>Blue Bombers\u00a0quarterback Drew Willy has been named the No. 1 CFL player of the week.</p><br />\n\t<p>The 28-year-old QB used his arm - and legs\u00a0to lead the Bombers to a 23-13 win\u00a0Thursday night\u00a0against the BC Lions.</p><br />\n\t<p>Willy, who was injured the week prior and was questionable as to whether he would even suit up\u00a0against the Lions, threw for 269 yards and two touchdowns in\u00a0completing 17 of 25 pass attempts.

Trust his eyes. Trust his instincts and just play. The worst thing you can do is try to hold back and not make a mistake,&quot; said Joseph.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;That&apos;s when you make them.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>Game can become blur for rookies</p><br />\n\t<p>He said for rookies like Smith, once on the field, the game can quickly turn into a blur, and it causes quarterbacks to miss key opportunities.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;As a veteran, you have seen so many things over the years, and you have been around so many defensive coordinators that you are accustomed to what they call,&quot; said Joseph.<br /> \u00a0<br /> &quot;As a young quarterback, sometimes it doesn&apos;t happen that way and the game just continues to move too fast for you and you have to wait and slow your eyes down.&quot;\u00a0</p><br />\n\t<p>Joseph says the best way to deal with that is through preparation and good coaching like he had.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;You have to break the field down. You have to break the defense down. That field is 65 yards wide, and if you try to look at the whole field, you&apos;re not going to see everything. And they taught me how to compartmentalize different plays,&quot; said Joseph.</p><br />\n\t<p>Starting a game more difficult</p><br />\n\t<p>Joseph said starting a game will be much more difficult for Smith, rather than coming in mid-way through.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;Coming into the game, coaches are going to game plan against you now. Being a young quarterback, he can expect to be pressured,&quot; said Joseph.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;They are going to try to confuse him, and that&apos;s one thing he can be prepared for.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>The good thing, said Joseph, is Smith will be surrounded by veteran players like Chris Getzlaf, Weston Dressler and Jerome Messam.</p><br />\n\t<p>He said that should help Smith to feel less pressure to carry the weight of the game on his shoulders.</p><br />\n\t<p>But he added that even after this game, Smith will continue to be studied by other teams.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;They are going to find out what he did well and what he didn&apos;t do well and they are going to try to attack that. So he is going to have another challenge,&quot; said Joseph.</p><br />\n\t<p>&quot;It takes a couple years before a guy can really get established in that league and get comfortable with a team and what different defenses are trying to do to you.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>The Riders face the Eskimos Friday night in Edmonton. Kick-off is at 7\u00a0p.m. CST.</p> ]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/07/31/troy-tulowitzki-trade-mak_n_7913108.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Troy Tulowitzki trade makes for awkward Jeopardy! moment]]></title>\n      <author>CBC</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/07/31/troy-tulowitzki-trade-mak_n_7913108.html?utm_hp_ref=canada-sports&amp;ir=Canada+Sports</link>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2015 11:38:52 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<p>Troy Tulowitzki was not\u00a0the only one surprised\u00a0that he was traded from the Colorado Rockies to the Toronto Blue Jays on Monday.\u00a0</p><br />\n\t<p>During Wednesday&apos;s broadcast\u00a0episode of\u00a0Jeopardy!, one of the show&apos;s $600 US clues was\u00a0&quot;In 2015 shortstop Troy Tulowitzki hopes to help this team fulfill its mile high hopes.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>Since the show films its episodes in advance, the contestant was correct when he answered with &quot;the Colorado Rockies.&quot;</p><br />\n\t<p>However, it still made for a funny (and awkward) viewing moment for both Blue Jays and Rockies fans alike.</p> ]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/07/30/jakub-voracek-flyers-agr_n_7907890.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Jakub Voracek, Flyers agree to multi-year extension]]></title>\n      <author>CBC</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/07/30/jakub-voracek-flyers-agr_n_7907890.html?utm_hp_ref=canada-sports&amp;ir=Canada+Sports</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2015 18:05:32 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Philadelphia Flyers and forward Jakub Voracek have agreed to a multi-year contract extension, the team announced Thursday.</p><br />\n\t<p>Voracek&apos;s deal will reportedly pay him $66 million US over eight years, and will go into effect following the 2015-2016 season.</p><br />\n\t<p>The 25-year-old led the Flyers with 59 assists and 81 points in the 2014-2015 season.
