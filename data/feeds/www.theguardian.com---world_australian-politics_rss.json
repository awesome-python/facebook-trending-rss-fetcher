In Australia, over $10bn a year of taxpayer money goes to subsidise negative gearing. We\u2019re not scrapping negative gearing entirely but we do want to do budget repair that is fair. We don\u2019t think the case is as fair as perhaps some people argue it is. I don\u2019t expect the real estate agents and their lobbies and their scare campaign to be reminding Australians that their profits are built upon the taxes which every Australian pays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t want to [do preference deals], I think the most likely scenario is there will be open tickets, we will let voters decide. I think voters are smart enough to decide for themselves \u2026 What I\u2019ve heard is maybe Liberal and Labor are talking a preference deal swap to squeeze out anyone running from the &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/nick-xenophon\"&gt;Nick Xenophon&lt;/a&gt; Team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T02:50:57.550Z\"&gt;3.50am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/strong&gt; is speaking in Melbourne at the Women\u2019s leadership forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few tidbits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Former PM Julia Gilliard says \"sense of purpose\" crucial for leaders &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFTS?src=hash\"&gt;#AFTS&lt;/a&gt; \"write down what you want to do.\" &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/f500smpGda\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/f500smpGda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;.&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliaGillard\"&gt;@JuliaGillard&lt;/a&gt; was encouraged to write down her purpose, keep it with her, and reflect on it when says got tough. &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/afts?src=hash\"&gt;#afts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\"We've got to be open to constructive criticism by people we trust.\" -&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliaGillard\"&gt;@JuliaGillard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFTS?src=hash\"&gt;#AFTS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T02:24:00.241Z\"&gt;3.24am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone looking thrilled to be in each other\u2019s company:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In keeping with Labor's school visits, Penny Wong at the gates of Henley High school. &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash\"&gt;#auspol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/KXTnwpoGke\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KXTnwpoGke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T02:21:00.772Z\"&gt;3.21am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberal campaign headquarters are distributing quotes from real estate industry leaders about their campaign against the Labor party\u2019s policies on negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sample:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research shows property investment isn\u2019t just for the wealthy; 37% of investors earned a combined household income under $100,000. The perception that investors are well-to-do is overblown. We also know that about 30% of our investors would sell if negative gearing was abolished or restricted, so we\u2019re concerned for tenants. Contrary to what the opposition may think, abolishing negative gearing would likely create panic purchasing, with a rush of investors buying up existing properties in the six months before changes are implemented. Often these are the same homes targeted by first home buyers.\u201d&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you take a blunt and heavy instrument to a complex problem, you are likely to generate a whole range of unintended negative consequences.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have to make it easier for first-home buyers, not harder. This will impact on the aspirations and commitments of a large bulk of Australians.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not a situation of the haves and have-nots. Overwhelmingly we understand the pressure on affordability, whether it be buying or renting. Our concern is politicians segregating the community by making them believe this will be good for them. We disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T02:11:15.936Z\"&gt;3.11am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven\u2019t written much on &lt;strong&gt;Duncan Storrar&lt;/strong&gt;, the man on welfare who asked a question on Q&amp;amp;A earlier this week and has since been scrutinised by News Corp Australia newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not strictly to do with the election campaign, or politics, but I see in the comments enough of you are interested to warrant a quick post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Tomorrows &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/theheraldsun\"&gt;@theheraldsun&lt;/a&gt; front page tonight &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash\"&gt;#auspol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/XbPMCghnfr\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XbPMCghnfr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s all part of legitimate public debate in my view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T01:49:00.691Z\"&gt;2.49am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull &lt;/strong&gt;has done a shopping centre walk in Adelaide and it looks bonkers.

Negative gearing needs to be reformed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real estate industry makes it clear, even in the article in News Limited today ,they accept they have a vested interest in keeping the current arrangements. Well I tell you who doesn\u2019t have a vested interest in keeping the current arrangements,hundreds of thousands of first home buyers who are being locked out of the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T01:03:11.002Z\"&gt;2.03am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ABC is reporting that an Australian contractor has been killed at Australia\u2019s embassy in Baghdad.

Looks pretty good imo &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/6eYHOPIeFS\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6eYHOPIeFS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T00:51:26.690Z\"&gt;1.51am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; is a dangerous threat to the economy, is that true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Turnbull can call me all the names under the sun he likes. What I think is dangerous for the Australian economy is that this government has tripled the deficit. What I think\u2019s dangerous for this economy is that under this government, real wages growth has flat-lined. We\u2019ve got an out-of-touch PM who thinks that the best advice you can give someone [who is] trying to enter the housing market, is to get a rich parent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I\u2019m looking forward to is outlining Labor\u2019s positive policies ... What I\u2019m interested in is listening to people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I\u2019d put &lt;strong&gt;Mark Latham\u2019&lt;/strong&gt;s fashion advice in the same box I put &lt;strong&gt;Scott Morrison&lt;/strong&gt;\u2019s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T00:45:16.285Z\"&gt;1.45am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is&lt;strong&gt; Bill Shorten &lt;/strong&gt;worried about the multi-million dollar campaign being mounted by the real estate industry against his negative gearing and capital gains policies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shorten says he will believe the Reserve Bank\u2019s assessment of his policies above major corporate real estate agents \u201cworried about Losing some of the taxpayer subsidies\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I understand that vested interests will always scream in defence of their particular part of taxpayer subsidy. In Australia,over $10bn a year of taxpayer money goes to subsidise negative gearing. We\u2019re not scrapping negative gearing entirely but we do want to do budget repair that is fair. We don\u2019t think the case is as fair as perhaps some people argue it is. I don\u2019t expect the real estate agents and their lobbies and their scare campaign to be reminding Australians that their profits are built upon the taxes which every Australian pays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I have to choose between supporting a business model which leads to a lucrative commissions for some real estate agents and property speculators funded by taxpayer money, or a choice between them and the young, impressive women we\u2019ve seen who are the finest, who are going to NASA, who are making remarkable steps forward in their science education, if I\u2019ve got to choose between the big end of town and the negative gearing brigade who don\u2019t want their $10bn of taxpayer subsidy in any fashion diminished or the schools and the hospitals of Australia, I choose the schools and the hospitals of Australia every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T00:39:26.476Z\"&gt;1.39am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is breaking news that there has been a shooting of a soldier and an army officer in Iraq. There are reports this is near the army base in Baghdad. &lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; says he will seek a briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this a war we should be fighting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is really important, especially in this heated election environment, that the men and women of our defence forces know that where they serve Australia and that their families back here in Australia also know on behalf of the ones they love overseas, Labor and the Coalition are shoulder to shoulder with the Australian people in defeating the sort of terrorism which is ruining literally millions of lives in that part of the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T00:37:21.183Z\"&gt;1.37am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; is joined by &lt;strong&gt;Tanya Plibersek &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Kate Ellis &lt;/strong&gt;at his press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Labor want to make maths and science compulsory? Ellis takes that question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that every student through to year 12 covers a Stem [science, technology, engineering and maths] subjects, now that means we need a flexible curriculum. We want to make sure that there is enough diversity in Stem that is on offer ... that there is something that interests each and every student. So that doesn\u2019t mean strictly maths, strictly science, but we do want to ensure by 2020 every student is studying Stem through to Year 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T00:32:56.673Z\"&gt;1.32am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone standing up at once! Now to &lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; in the inner-west in Sydney. He has visited another school to talk up Labor\u2019s education policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s some debate in Australia at the moment that investing in education, investing in teachers, won\u2019t deliver an economic dividend. Of course it will. In life there are some things which are beyond doubt. A smart, educated Australia will be a prosperous, successful Australia and that is beyond doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T00:28:51.480Z\"&gt;1.28am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossbench senators are standing up in Canberra after the high court dismissal of the case against the Senate voting reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family First senator &lt;strong&gt;Bob Day &lt;/strong&gt;says the reforms have \u201ctaken away voters\u2019 rights\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It punishes those voters who vote for minor parties by threatening to kill off their votes and the fact that we had a fair hearing here in the high court ... I\u2019m satisfied that we do have in the high court a very, very good system of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T00:25:52.274Z\"&gt;1.25am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astute &lt;strong&gt;Paul Karp&lt;/strong&gt; has the details of the high court dismissing the Senate reforms case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high court has unanimously rejected Senator &lt;strong&gt;Bob Day&lt;/strong&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/21/bob-day-launches-high-court-challenge-against-senate-voting-changes\"&gt;challenge of Senate reforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T00:24:46.930Z\"&gt;1.24am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull &lt;/strong&gt;asked almost straight away how he feels about being described by &lt;strong&gt;Peta Credlin&lt;/strong&gt; as \u201cMr Harbourside Mansion\u201d:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone is entitled to their comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m focused on jobs and growth. Australians know the difference between the government I lead and the government &lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; wants to lead. The government I lead is focused on them. It\u2019s focused on ensuring our children and grandchildren have great jobs in the future and now. It\u2019s focused on ensuring we get the economic growth that will enable us to enjoy our wonderful lifestyle in Australia now and into the years ahead. That\u2019s my commitment, our economic plan, strong growth, more jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; represents a dangerous threat to our economy. Just think about it. This is what &lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; is proposing to do. He is going to deter investment. Now all of us agree, that we need more investment ... What&lt;strong&gt; Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; is proposing to do is to ban negative gearing, which will reduce investment, reduce property values,and he\u2019s going to increase capital gains tax by 50%. Now capital gains tax is a tax on investment, that is what it is. He is going to increase the tax on investment. Let me tell you, if you want less of something, tax it more. If you want more of something, tax it less. &lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; clearly wants less investment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt people on very high incomes and with very large superannuation accounts will have to pay more tax, OK. That\u2019s the case. We make no bones about that. But it will also mean that people earning, on low incomes, up to $37,000 will not be paying tax on their super contributions. That\u2019s good, that\u2019s fair at that end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adelaide Hills is delightful to campaign in and I look forward to returning to Adelaide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T00:11:00.245Z\"&gt;1.11am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Adelaide &lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/strong&gt; is announcing the public transport funding flagged by the Adelaide Advertiser earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Blessed are the innovators &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash\"&gt;#auspol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/zOp8Ww8oZi\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zOp8Ww8oZi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-13T00:05:26.848Z\"&gt;1.05am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News just filtering through that the high court is not holding up senator &lt;strong&gt;Bob Day&lt;/strong&gt;\u2019s case against the government\u2019s Senate reforms, which will change how people can vote for the upper house.

Some thoughts on what some are trying to frame as \u201cclass warfare\u201d from TheBBG .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many common everyday average people look up to the wealthy as having somehow a great insight into how to improve things because of their prosperity. They cannot grasp that the wealthy focuse on improving their own lots in life, not anyone elses. Peter Morris seems a case in point. Respecting someone for being successful is one thing, but holding them up as models to lead a country for the benefits of all is another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T23:44:42.571Z\"&gt;12.44am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scott Morrison&lt;/strong&gt;\u2019s interview with &lt;strong&gt;Jon Faine&lt;/strong&gt; continues ... the Institute of Public Affairs and Labor are both campaigning against the government\u2019s superannuation changes. Those are strange bedfellows, surely?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our super charges are there, they\u2019re in budget, we\u2019re going forward with it, they\u2019re fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I reduce taxes in the future are they going to talk about that being retrospective because people thought they were going to be higher in the future? Of course not. This is about earnings in the future, and yes they affect a small minority of superannuants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, those on top marginal rate account for less than 3% of taxpayers and account for 30% of tax paid, we have a progressive tax system and that means those people on higher incomes end up paying the overwhelming majority of taxes, and that\u2019s the system we have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No I haven\u2019t. Off the hand remarks are made from time to time in politics, he hit me back with one of his zingers, so good for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m glad you missed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T23:37:05.378Z\"&gt;12.37am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treasurer, &lt;strong&gt;Scott Morrison, &lt;/strong&gt;is now speaking to Jon Faine on 774 ABC Melbourne.

The piece in the Australian saying it will cost $100bn, there is no basis to that \u2026 interestingly [the report is] backed by the Coalition\u2019s friends at the IPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I make no apology for arguing for jobs \u2026 what will the cost be of having hundreds of thousands of people out of work? What will the cost be to Centrelink, to reduced tax receipts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T22:00:06.204Z\"&gt;11.00pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Xenophon&lt;/strong&gt; is now on Radio National being asked if he has done a preference deal with Labor to get more votes in Jamie Briggs\u2019s seat of Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No preference deals have been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t want to [do preference deals], I think the most likely scenario is there will be open tickets, we will let voters decide. I think voters are smart enough to decide for themselves \u2026 What I\u2019ve heard is maybe Liberal and Labor are talking a preference deal swap to squeeze out anyone running from the Nick Xenophon Team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite what some media commenators say I actually consult with candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always feel more comfortable having it as a an open ticket \u2026 if we\u2019re neither to the left or right philosophically an open ticket is the preferred outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No not a stunt, I spoke to your researcher yesterday and was asked how I was funding it, I just made the point it\u2019s tough, I\u2019m running on a shoestring campaign, it\u2019s tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T21:38:58.316Z\"&gt;10.38pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Adelaide today (&lt;strong&gt;Nick Xenophon&lt;/strong&gt;\u2019s town!)&lt;strong&gt; Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/strong&gt; will announce federal funding for the $85m train from the city to Flinders University, &lt;a href=\"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/federal-election/train-from-city-to-flinders-university-and-medical-centre-in-85-million-plan/news-story/3c8f09559d9afa0ccfaccdd08b39a2b1\"&gt;according to the Adelaide Advertiser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper describes Turnbull as the \u201cpublic transport loving prime minister\u201d and says the federal government will provide half of the $85m needed, which the Labor state government has been calling for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tonsley rail line will be extended 650m and will be partly elevated, with a pedestrian and cycle path alongside and a new station next to the FMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It estimates the train would cut travel time by up to 18 minutes by putting commuters on the fast track instead of buses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T21:27:20.000Z\"&gt;10.27pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Xenophon&lt;/strong&gt;\u2019s new party is projected to give the Liberals a run for their money in South Australia, threatening a couple of sitting politicians both in the Senate and the lower house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The media stunt mastermind is remortgaging his house to fund the campaign and t&lt;a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/federal-election-2016-nick-xenophon-comes-with-100bn-cost/news-story/8ed56332ab031adb7028fcd21512f566?utm_content=SocialFlow&amp;amp;utm_campaign=EditorialSF&amp;amp;utm_source=TheAustralian&amp;amp;utm_medium=Twitter\"&gt;he Australian has decided to investigate &lt;/a&gt;how much he could cost taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the budget already in a severe state of disrepair, it is essential political parties provide policy costings for taxpayers to scrutinise. Senator Xenophon has yet to offer the public costings, but any reasonable analysis reveals his policies are simply unaffordable. Rather than offer pie-in-the-sky fiscal promises to voters, all parties, big and small, must release credible costings that are fiscally sustainable.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T21:03:38.132Z\"&gt;10.03pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high court will decide today on Senate voting reform in the case &lt;strong&gt;Bob Day &lt;/strong&gt;brought against the government over the legislated changes which stop complicated preference deals which advantage minor parties.

The excuse usually being that they are confined by the deadlines of a multiplicity of modern media platforms \u2013 nothing to do with pacing themselves, or minimising exposure risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This very limited campaigning clearly restricts the time for serious, in-depth questioning, allowing short, blunt responses to difficult, penetrating questions, and for the politicians to then to move on quickly to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Tomorrows &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/theheraldsun\"&gt;@theheraldsun&lt;/a&gt; front page tonight &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash\"&gt;#auspol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/XbPMCghnfr\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XbPMCghnfr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/13/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-greens-politics-live\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-election-2016\">Australian election 2016</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics\">Australian politics</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull\">Malcolm Turnbull</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten\">Bill Shorten</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-news\">Australia news</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition\">Coalition</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party\">Labor party</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/peta-credlin\">Peta Credlin</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-greens\">Australian Greens</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party\">Liberal party</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/nick-xenophon\">Nick Xenophon</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 03:02:22 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/13/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-greens-politics-live</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0bf4eea4b403db2bb43da288c01864d531ffd11/0_0_3000_1800/3000.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1fa8f8b90ebe80ff0629d4df53264842\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Michael Dodge/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0bf4eea4b403db2bb43da288c01864d531ffd11/0_0_3000_1800/3000.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=917fa759ae814cbac2657eb863d98e97\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Michael Dodge/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Bridie Jabour</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-13T03:02:22Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Why are we surprised by every populist politician?

Populist leaders are defined more by their style than their ideology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For at least the last 20 years, democracies around the world have been regularly subject to a mounting series of populist insurgencies. From France to Venezuela, sharp-elbowed political actors from both the left and the right have railed against elites, flouted the table manners of liberal politics, and are increasingly meeting with electoral success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seems that every time this happens, it takes commentators by surprise. Witness the worldwide reaction to the rise of Donald Trump. First came denial, with &lt;a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-media-stop-freaking-out-about-donald-trumps-polls/\"&gt;even empirical journalists resisting what polling is telling them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/13/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-greens-politics-live\"&gt;Australian election 2016: high court dismisses challenge to Senate voting reforms \u2013 politics live&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the era of the rise of Hanson. Growing up in Western Sydney, I knew some people who were otherwise pretty reasonable who were sympathetic to Hanson\u2019s message, which I found abhorrent. That\u2019s where the seeds were sown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is a good example here. Commentators are tying themselves in knots trying to work out where he stands, and why people don\u2019t care that he\u2019s flip-flopping on tax or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Populist performance spits in the face of what is considered appropriate behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media\u2019s seen as part of the humanities, it\u2019s soft, it\u2019s not science, it\u2019s seen as flippant, not the hard stuff. It\u2019s puzzling to me, because I don\u2019t think any citizens experience politics without mediation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/why-are-we-surprised-by-every-populist-politician-voting-for-them-can-be-a-rational-choice\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics\">Politics</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics\">Australian politics</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/clive-palmer\">Clive Palmer</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-news\">Australia news</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:53:31 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/why-are-we-surprised-by-every-populist-politician-voting-for-them-can-be-a-rational-choice</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0039c01f90f038bdc6494302c1c6ae456a1a4fb1/0_0_2500_1500/2500.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=072564871a2872f36a43bc600ee073fd\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Composite: Reuters/AAP</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0039c01f90f038bdc6494302c1c6ae456a1a4fb1/0_0_2500_1500/2500.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9d944b583d56703d7ed97e5a513cf280\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Composite: Reuters/AAP</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Jason Wilson</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-13T01:53:31Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>High court rejects Bob Day appeal and finds Senate voting changes are legal</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/13/high-court-rejects-bob-day-appeal-and-finds-senate-voting-changes-are-legal</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Justices\u2019 decision notes challenge does not prove voters are disenfranchised and is \u2018in truth an argument about the consequences of elector choice\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high court has unanimously rejected Senator Bob Day\u2019s &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/21/bob-day-launches-high-court-challenge-against-senate-voting-changes\"&gt;challenge of Senate voting c&lt;/a&gt;hanges, finding they do not infringe the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge was heard on 2 May and disposed of on Friday, clearing the way for the 2 July election using the new voting system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

An amalgamation could still be on the cards, so the premier\u2019s announcement today could well be a case of Walcha getting out of the frypan and into the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this just a cynical attempt to get the amalgamation issue off the political agenda until after the federal election on July 2?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T06:06:20.172Z\"&gt;7.06am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education minister &lt;strong&gt;Simon Birmingham&lt;/strong&gt; has spoken to the ABC about education funding and the ongoing stoush about which side has the better education policy. I will come back to that in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he was also asked about the South Australian Liberal Senate ticket. Birmo, as he is known on the twits, knocked &lt;strong&gt;Cory Bernardi&lt;/strong&gt; off his number one perch. He was asked if this development was going to cause more divisions between the moderate and conservative camps in the Libs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not at all. It\u2019s been an incredibly amicable approach and we are all at one in regards to the Senate ticket in SA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T05:37:24.148Z\"&gt;6.37am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dumped Labor Fremantle candidate Chris Brown&lt;/strong&gt; has just made a short statement to the media:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been honest and truthful with the Labor Party on paper and in person. There have been many positive comments about my future in the party. Fremantle has always been my home and I believe my future is here in Fremantle. &lt;strong&gt;I would ask Shorten to genuinely reassess the information used to disendorse my candidacy so that I can continue in our campaign. &lt;/strong&gt;After receiving legal advice earlier today, I cannot make further comment at this time. But I may have additional comments for you in the morning. I hope the ALP resolves this issue quickly and fairly so we can focus on the issues that matter to the Australian people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T05:30:23.167Z\"&gt;6.30am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I am going to tap into the brains trust - you dear readers - for any local knowledge regarding the mergers. Let me know what is happening in your district and whether it could impinge on the election results for your local MPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the government release:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T05:28:49.487Z\"&gt;6.28am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I understand it, the council amalgamations are threatening to impinge on federal Liberal and National members in rural areas - even though it is a state government issue. I am not predicting that anyone is going to be thrown out but I know in my rural/regional area, people are very cranky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is because local councils were offered (financial) carrots two years ago to consider their best options for merging. Councils were told their decisions would be respected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T05:14:20.139Z\"&gt;6.14am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just back to New South Wales, where the state government has had a little rejig of its proposed amalgamations. The Baird government was proposing to force 35 amalgamations of local councils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the NSW government has cut that down to 19 forced amalgamations at this stage. A further nine amalgamations have been given in principle support by &lt;strong&gt;Premier Baird&lt;/strong&gt; and the National local government minister &lt;strong&gt;Paul Toole but have been delayed&lt;/strong&gt;. And three proposals are \u201cpending\u201d, which sounds like they are delayed for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T04:57:53.698Z\"&gt;5.57am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson bucks up and makes his pitch to the locals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these circumstances the campaign is already under way. I\u2019m energised by that challenge, I\u2019m ready to make a strong case that I\u2019m the best person to represent this electorate. I have lived here virtually all my life, all my family live here. I\u2019ve raised my family here, I\u2019m on the board of my kids\u2019 school in Spearwood and over the last 12 years I\u2019ve made a significant contribution in public service and through leadership in local government, including five years as the deputy mayor here in Fremantle. I have deep and wide connections into this community. I understand how important it is that we get a proper investment in schools and education and in renewable energy and jobs, particularly for young people. I\u2019m passionate about marine conservation and about closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. This is a critical election for Australia\u2019s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T04:55:47.327Z\"&gt;5.55am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Wilson winning the golden ticket, he was looking pretty worried. The WA Labor boss Tinley had to tell him to buck up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smile, mate. It is a good-news story!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T04:54:07.866Z\"&gt;5.54am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are unfamiliar with the story, &lt;strong&gt;Paul Karp&lt;/strong&gt; has written &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/11/labor-to-disendorse-fremantle-candidate-chris-brown-after-failure-to-disclose-convictions\"&gt;something here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Paul\u2019s story, Chris Brown&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/10/labors-battle-decisive-western-australia-seats-election-2016\"&gt;a freight and logistics worker who has spent the past 12 months as a campaign coordinator&lt;/a&gt; for the Maritime Union of Australia. He won the preselection battle for Fremantle, beating &lt;strong&gt;Josh Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;, a former staffer for the current Fremantle MP, Melissa Parke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T04:48:20.372Z\"&gt;5.48am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WA Labor secretary, &lt;strong&gt;Peter Tinley,&lt;/strong&gt; is asked about the processes open to Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the appeal processes for Chris Brown, what avenues are open to him, why was the preselection so small and why did this not come to light?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not a member of the national executive so can\u2019t answer detailed questions in relation to the process. The process was followed. Those questions are best sent to &lt;strong&gt;George Wright&lt;/strong&gt;, our national secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T04:45:53.528Z\"&gt;5.45am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off the bat, &lt;strong&gt;Josh Wilson &lt;/strong&gt;is asked about the Labor asylum seeker policy, given he has protested in the Let Them Stay rallies in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I support Labor\u2019s policy on asylum seekers. I look forward to a Labor government increasing our humanitarian intake by 100%, doubling our humanitarian intake and importing the UN convention into domestic law, providing a specific commissioner to look after the interests of refugee children. Those changes are incredibly important. They only happen under a Shorten Labor government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T04:44:04.815Z\"&gt;5.44am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon all. Long time no interact. More of that in a mo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Labor candidate for Fremantle, &lt;strong&gt;Josh Wilson,&lt;/strong&gt; is now speaking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;good guy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T04:26:32.632Z\"&gt;5.26am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I need to bid you farewell in order to devote some attention to my campaign podcast project with &lt;strong&gt;Lenore Taylor&lt;/strong&gt;.

If you\u2019ve ever wandered around the city with him, it\u2019s like being with a minor celebrity. It\u2019s really quite a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T04:19:37.716Z\"&gt;5.19am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Xenophon&lt;/strong&gt; is in Adelaide, holding an empty pizza box. This might seem a bit strange unless you know &lt;strong&gt;Nick Xenophon&lt;/strong&gt;. The pizza box is a pun around Pyne delivers, which is the catchphrase from &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Pyne\u2019s&lt;/strong&gt; signage around Adelaide. Looks like the preferences stoush has taken a new turn. Xenophon says &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Pyne&lt;/strong&gt; is being &lt;em&gt;shamelessly mischievous&lt;/em&gt; by speculating that he\u2019s done a deal with Labor over preferences. Xenophon wants to know what Pyne is up to with preferences. Is he playing footsie with the Labor party to lock out the Xenophon candidates?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Xenophon:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Pyne needs to clear the air as to whether he\u2019s been involved directly or indirectly with any discussions whatsoever with the Australian Labor party about the two major parties doing a cozy deal to knockout any Nick Xenophon Team candidates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T03:42:56.890Z\"&gt;4.42am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I mention it\u2019s my birthday?

China plans to shed 100-150 million tonnes of domestic crude steel capacity in the next five years in a bid to help tackle huge capacity overhangs that have saddled domestic firms with losses and debts.\u201d &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T03:17:36.711Z\"&gt;4.17am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given I had to skip over it quickly I\u2019m glad the trade minister &lt;strong&gt;Steve Ciobo &lt;/strong&gt;is up now on the ABC being asked about the prime minister\u2019s conversation this morning with the US president on steel. I mentioned this during the press conference earlier today: Turnbull said the two leaders would work together against the practice of cheap dumping of steel. Ciobo is asked what this means in practice. His explanation seems to mean it\u2019s status quo from an Australian perspective. Australia has an independent Anti-Dumping Commission, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Ciobo:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recently took that decision in relation to some steel products from out of China. What\u2019s important is Australia acts consistently with our world trade organisation obligations. We expect other countries to act consistently with the WTO so we want to act consistently with the WTO. We will continue to monitor the situation but we are always going to act in accordance with the World Trade Organisation obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of countries face the same pressure. We know there is a global over-supply of steel. That is an incontrovertible fact. What we want to do is work out the best way forward. Clearly the United States has got concerns, the same as Australia does, we recognise that. This isn\u2019t something that is confined just to China, this is part of a global over-production of steel. I think it\u2019s important we continue to have discussions with country around the globe. We sent the relevant Assistant Minister to Europe to have discussions in the European Union in relation to steel dumping. We are proactive on this front. We will not let Australia be abused in regard to steel dumping. Of course, we are going to continue to pursue Australia\u2019s national interest to drive jobs and drive growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T03:06:54.574Z\"&gt;4.06am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Are these men meant to be released if they are not charged within 24 hours?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is entirely a matter for the police to decide whether or not to charge them. In any policing operation a judgement has to be made. The police like to leave it as late as possible to make an arrest so they can gather evidence. The intervention can\u2019t be so late that suspects escape or harm is done. So it\u2019s a fine judgement which we should leave it to the police to make as to the point in which they should intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T03:02:29.407Z\"&gt;4.02am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I\u2019ve been alternating between Melinda and bulls various government folks have been up and about in Brisbane on the theme of domestic violence. I\u2019m happy to stand corrected but I don\u2019t think it was new money, it was drawing attention to the sum of the parts. The attorney-general &lt;strong&gt;George Brandis &lt;/strong&gt;was part of the posse and got a bunch of questions on the men picked up yesterday who were trying to leave Australia for Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: These men have been held for longer than 24 hours, do you expect charges to be laid?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is entirely a matter for the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is entirely a matter for the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T02:57:04.299Z\"&gt;3.57am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Bill has moved on to bull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;.&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/billshortenmp\"&gt;@billshortenmp&lt;/a&gt; (w/ &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/chloeshorten\"&gt;@chloeshorten&lt;/a&gt;) says education campaign will lock in future of regional students &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/DPDjXngrMS\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DPDjXngrMS&lt;/a&gt; ( Dan_Bourchier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T02:54:42.204Z\"&gt;3.54am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps time for a short break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Prime Minister Turnbull just headed into the exclusive atheneum club &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/theage\"&gt;@theage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/UDspu7ZL0i\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UDspu7ZL0i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T02:47:05.368Z\"&gt;3.47am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looks like Melinda is now holding an impromptu doorstop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\"I don't want charity.

But Melinda, who did not want to give her surname, heard word on the radio this morning Turnbull would be in the area and, seeing the camera crews outside the Maranda warehouse, took her opportunity.

This is in response to a shouted question about the Panama Papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scott Morrison:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister dealt with that fairly comprehensively today in his earlier statements. There\u2019s no suggestion of any impropriety from the PM and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re suggesting anything by raising that in the press conference today, I am sure. That was 20 years ago and it\u2019s all about there in the public sphere and \u2013 the thing about Malcolm Turnbull is he has had a lot of experience. He has had a lot of experience in supporting businesses not unlike this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has invested in them. He has created them. He has employed people over his lifetime. And he\u2019s got a lot of experience in how to drive economic policy in this country which sees our economy move through this transition. That is what our national economic plan is all about. It\u2019s all about ensuring that we have the right set of policies that back businesses like this one so they can put more people on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T01:49:02.298Z\"&gt;2.49am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Labor leader ends this outing by asking himself a question on his birthday \u2013 what is he getting for his birthday?

How do we actually know this money will be spent in the regions given the federal government doesn\u2019t actually run schools?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shorten motions in the party\u2019s education spokesperson, &lt;strong&gt;Kate Ellis&lt;/strong&gt;, who says there will be transparency mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the funding for regional schools, we have made very clear that this funding will only be directed towards the evidence-based programs which we know lift student out comes and make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only people that were interested in sending a blank cheque when it came to school funding was the current government when they wrote to the states and territories, said that funding for schools would be no strings attached ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. There was already accountability mechanisms which were written into the current agreements. We are being very clear that taxpayers deserve to know how every dollar is being well spent. Equally parents deserve to know that that money is going to towards the program that will lift their child\u2019s student out comes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T01:41:14.155Z\"&gt;2.41am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to Fremantle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: What is the problem in Fremantle is it the conviction or the fact they weren\u2019t disclosed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is on clear that serious matters the candidate wasn\u2019t forth coming with the truth to the Labor party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national secretary of the Labor party [has been] ... investigating these matters. He found there had been a deliberate misleading. He recommended that, therefore, this person shouldn\u2019t be our candidate. I 100% back that decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national executive today will pick a new candidate for Fremantle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T01:38:23.475Z\"&gt;2.38am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; gets two questions on the growth projections associated with his education policy, the OECD figures, that I mentioned earlier on today. Shorten says there is a clear case to fund schools according to need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have not run into a single parent in the big cities or the small towns or the great provincial cities of Australia like Rockhampton where they\u2019ve come up to me and said: \u201cGee, Bill, we don\u2019t want to see more money for our kids in education.\u201d Nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, is there a serious argument being mounted by some conservative commentators who want to maintain a two-tiered education system in this country that not spending money on this country is not an investment in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T01:34:55.965Z\"&gt;2.34am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Will Josh Wilson replace Chris Brown if he supports boat turnbacks?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is a good candidate and he will be the candidate if he is preselected. Let\u2019s be clear about this issue -the Labor party, I think, quite straight up with the Australian people, debated these issues. We debated them last July. There is grave disquiet in the community about the treatment of people on Manus and Nauru ... but there is 100% resolve amongst the Labor party and I believe the vast bulk of the Australian people, to stop the drownings at sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That debate was all about people seeking asylum. It was a long debate and I didn\u2019t have a vote in that debate. I was a participant. Once preselected there\u2019s a party position and that is the position I take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T01:30:14.626Z\"&gt;2.30am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a high lob on &lt;strong&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/strong&gt; campaigning in Queensland, does the Liberal party have two leaders? Yes, quite, thinks Shorten. Quite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Do you regret that Chris Brown was chosen as a candidate for Fremantle considering he has now disclosed his criminal past?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very disappointed by this set of events. The Labor party has acted and we\u2019re moving on from it. The national secretary has made a recommendation to me. When I received the formal report I have made it clear I endorse the recommendation and that is - the party is going to make its decisions today. They will do so and I believe that Josh Wilson, the deputy mayor of Fremantle, will be a very good candidate in Fremantle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the party processes were not followed. On very important matters. The party has made a recommendation to me that he should not be the endorsed candidate. And I have absolutely supported that decision, 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T01:26:09.844Z\"&gt;2.26am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Into questions now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Do you need to instil more party discipline around your refugee policy? One of your candidates has likened the process to Nazi concentration camps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t accept the language that was used at all by our candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And let me again state the Labor party\u2019s dealt with this difficult issue at our conference last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T01:23:33.255Z\"&gt;2.23am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Labor leader is speaking to reporters now on education. Today\u2019s pledge is $1.8bn of the $3.8bn dollars promised in additional needs based funding for schools will flow to schools in regional areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T01:19:49.535Z\"&gt;2.19am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Labor man has materialised beside my desk hotly disputing my advice to you about the caretaker convention. He says the &lt;a href=\"https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/guidance-caretaker-conventions-2016.pdf\"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; on the department of prime minister and cabinet website says caretaker begins with the dissolution of the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never mind the writs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caretaker period begins at the time the House of Representatives is dissolved and continues until the election result is clear or, if there is a change of government, until the new government is appointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T01:12:53.329Z\"&gt;2.12am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labor\u2019s candidate in Fremantle &lt;strong&gt;Chris Brown&lt;/strong&gt; has held a short media conference to say the only reason the ALP knows about his prior spent convictions is because he brought it to their attention. According to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/alp-union-candidate-dumped-for-past-crimes/news-story/7aa3af2dd53e8b169388eab7a93053c7?login=1\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in The Australian this morning, \u201cBrown pleaded guilty as a 19-year-old to assaulting a police officer during an altercation with a group of men in 1985. He received a 12-month good behaviour bond and the conviction was expunged in 2011. When he was 18, Brown was charged with drink driving and had his licence suspended for three months. This charge was also removed from his record in accordance with the Spent Convictions Act.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Can you talk us through the circumstances of how it came about?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I was at a festival in Claremont and I was king hit. I was held down by two individuals, punched by a third, pulled to my feet bloodied and dazed. My vision was impaired. I was struggling, I got an arm free to defend myself thinking I was going to be attacked. I was later informed contact was made by a police officer who had come to rescue me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T01:01:58.209Z\"&gt;2.01am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the beef capital of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Chloe joins husband &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/billshortenmp\"&gt;@billshortenmp&lt;/a&gt; for his 49th birthday &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/afronthetrail?src=hash\"&gt;#afronthetrail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ausvotes2016?src=hash\"&gt;#ausvotes2016&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/sYOZFMbZx0\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sYOZFMbZx0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:58:30.003Z\"&gt;1.58am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was trying to have a little dramatic build in my question earlier about who is right about caretaker \u2013 &lt;strong&gt;P Duddy&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Pyne&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 but of course you folks are all so on it you\u2019ve piled in on Twitter already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in caretaker as of 16 May, which is next week. On a procedural question, if you ever have to pick a side, go with Pyne every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:53:58.815Z\"&gt;1.53am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting that the prime minister\u2019s press conference ran longer today than it has the last couple of days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:48:46.818Z\"&gt;1.48am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a barrel? Roll out the barrel? Is this a barrel of laughs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:44:09.210Z\"&gt;1.44am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to tidy up the immigration minister from earlier on before I check what pictures I have from the Turnbull outing, and share a few thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Dutton&lt;/strong&gt; was asked in his press conference earlier about Manus and Australia\u2019s obligations to the detainees \u2013 questions he attempted to dead bat. Then he was asked about why Green Senator &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Hanson-Young&lt;/strong&gt; is banned from visiting detention centres throughout the election campaign. &lt;em&gt;Does that apply to all federal MPs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s been a long-standing arrangement. As I understand, operating under both sides of government in this country and Senator Hanson-Young, through her mouthpiece in The Guardian, really needs to reassess why she wants to mislead, and why the Guardian wants to mislead the Australian public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re not yet in caretaker mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:32:30.537Z\"&gt;1.32am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: When will you intend to visit a shopping centre or street walk to meet voters out of these carefully stage managed opportunities?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look forward to that. I\u2019m sorry you weren\u2019t able to join us yesterday on the train. There were lots of voters on the train and I am getting out and about all around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I did not get the train this morning. In fact there isn\u2019t a train station at Mornington. There is to Frankston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:30:39.970Z\"&gt;1.30am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now to &lt;strong&gt;George Christensen\u2019s&lt;/strong&gt; comments on the Syrian refugees. &lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull &lt;/strong&gt;makes it clear that as well as his chat with &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt;, he\u2019s also spoken to his Queensland MP about his comments. Turnbull says Christensen was expressing a view about the economic downturn in his region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that Mr Christensen was expressing a view about - he is concerned about the economic downturn in his region and he is concerned that the introduction, if you like, of people coming through the humanitarian program could - would come into a region where there aren\u2019t enough jobs and that\u2019s the basis on which he\u2019s made those observations as he\u2019s advised me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me say to you that the company in which Neville Wran and I were directors was an Australian listed company and had it made any profits which it did not, regrettably, it certainly would have paid tax inAustralia, obviously you haven\u2019t studied the accounts of the company concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plainly the objective, when you bring in refugees into Australia, indeed any arrivals into Australia, is to put them in a position where they are given the skills and the opportunities to get into work. That is the whole objective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:24:35.767Z\"&gt;1.24am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about a WA poll, NSW council amalgamations, and whether he likes beer or wine. On that score he likes lager. So noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:23:32.835Z\"&gt;1.23am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: PM, will you be campaigning with Tony Abbott over the next 7 weeks?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I just say to you that Mr Abbott is campaigning for the return of the Turnbull government and if the occasion arises, no doubt we can. We may be able to campaign in Warringah in his electorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:22:20.591Z\"&gt;1.22am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turnbull is asked first whether he has full confidence in the Liberal party\u2019s preselection processes given the spat about Labor\u2019s candidate in Fremantle. Turnbull doesn\u2019t express it in those terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a very rigorous process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well can I just say to you that as the article acknowledged, there is no suggestion of any impropriety whatsoever. There is nothing new there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company concerned was a wholly owned subsidiary of a publicly listed Australian company. So an ASX listed company of which Neville Wran and I were both directors for about two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:18:30.483Z\"&gt;1.18am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two leaders also spoke about the steel glut, and about joint action to address that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:18:10.354Z\"&gt;1.18am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as exciting times in craft beer the prime minister confirms he\u2019s chatted this morning to the US president, &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should note that I\u2019ve had a good discussion this morning with President Obama on a range of global and regional issues, one of which was the progress of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal which, as you know, is another one of the big trade deals that has been agreed. It has to be ratified by the Congress. The president is confident it can be ratified before the end of the year. So we\u2019re very encouraged by that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We talked about the security situation in the Middle East and the president briefed me on developments there from his perspective and I did the same from ours. And he thanked Australia for what he described as our extraordinary contribution to the battle against Isil and Daesh. We also talked about security issues in our region and confirmed our strong commitment to freedom of navigation throughout the region and the importance of any territorial disputes being resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:14:39.954Z\"&gt;1.14am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s more in Dutton but I have to move past him for now to the prime minister, who is &lt;em&gt;inspired&lt;/em&gt; by craft beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:13:38.343Z\"&gt;1.13am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporters move on to other issues to hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: George Christensen says he\u2019s been advised Syrian refugees won\u2019t be resettled in his seat of Dawson. Do you know whether the department has advised MPs who have asked, that Syrians won\u2019t be resettled in their seats? Are there no-go areas for Syrian refugees?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government obviously works with the states and you will remember that the state premiers and territory leaders were falling over themselves to provide support to the 12,000 people being brought in and we welcome that. And we\u2019ve been working closely with states and territories. In the end, people make decisions about where it is they will reside. I suspect most people will reside in capital cities because that\u2019s where they have family members and that\u2019s where they have support networks within the refugee community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our department\u2019s job, as the immigration department, is to provide screening of people, and we\u2019ve screened some 9,500 and there have been about 5,000 visas issued, about 1,500 people that have arrived in Australia already. Our job as the immigration department is to screen those people to make sure we have the health checks done, to make sure we have the security checks done, and in terms of settlement services, well that\u2019s an issue for Mr Porter and the social service portfolio. From from an immigration department perspective, our job is to make sure that we deal with people to make sure that they\u2019re not going to be a threat to Australian society and we helped settled refugees in record numbers. Many of those coming from Syria and other parts of the Middle East will be Christians because they have been part of a persecuted minority there and that\u2019s part of the criteria that the government put in place when we made the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I don\u2019t know how you can draw the conclusion \u2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said, refer back to what I just stated. I\u2019m not sure how you could try and represent that some other way. So that\u2019s the position of Immigration and Border Protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven\u2019t spoken to Mr Christensen. We will work with people across the country and no doubt social services will do that work to help settle people in community housing. We\u2019re a generous nation when it comes to refugees and that\u2019s the position of this department, in terms of the Syrian intake, in terms of the 13,750 people that we will take this year within the refugee and humanitarian program. Otherwise, as I say, our job is to provide the security and health screening checks, issue visas and provide that assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I don\u2019t have any comment to make in relation to those issues, in terms of immigration, our job is to provide support to people, to come to our country. We welcome people that come here under the refugee and humanitarian program. That\u2019s been along established practice in this country and we will continue to provide that support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:04:03.822Z\"&gt;1.04am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Canberra the immigration minister, &lt;strong&gt;Peter Dutton,&lt;/strong&gt; is advising reporters that Labor is falling to pieces on border protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Dutton:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have restored integrity to our borders and it seems to me that Mr Shorten has completely lost control of this issue and he needs to provide some clarification, some discipline of those members. But there is open revolt within the Labor party and it is obvious to all Australians that Bill Shorten has lost control of this issue and that the wheels have clearly fallen off the Labor party\u2019s policy on border protection and people don\u2019t want to see people drowning at sea or new boat arrivals and that\u2019s what Labor is promising at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T23:41:00.310Z\"&gt;12.41am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have now entered Bruce Country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The former sitting member &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillsonBruce\"&gt;@BillsonBruce&lt;/a&gt; selling it like a new candidate in Dunkley &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo\"&gt;@murpharoo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus\"&gt;@GuardianAus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/Dq00SHML3g\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Dq00SHML3g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T23:40:13.641Z\"&gt;12.40am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly the first time the prime minister has been compared to a craft beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo\"&gt;@murpharoo&lt;/a&gt; in which Bruce Billson compares the election campaign to a beer. &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/N7P8m5EJxS\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N7P8m5EJxS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T23:38:55.872Z\"&gt;12.38am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian Medical Association is in parliament at the moment to try and get some focus on health in this election. The AMA president, &lt;strong&gt;Brian Owler,&lt;/strong&gt; says this election should be a referendum on the public health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian Owler:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve had now three years of surprises from the current government in terms of health policy. What we want to see is each party outline in advance what their plans are for health in this country. We want to see a coherent plan for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T23:31:28.551Z\"&gt;12.31am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Telegraph &lt;a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/north-shore/deposed-prime-minister-tony-abbott-poses-for-selfies-with-delighted-crowds-in-mosman/news-story/916e92ce9ed7dbee92fdcd4c862a7c67\"&gt;reports this morning&lt;/a&gt; that the former prime minister &lt;strong&gt;Tony Abbott &lt;/strong&gt;has been mobbed campaigning in Mosman over the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little while back Abbott wasn\u2019t a fan of changing the concessions on superannuation, but he appears to have now fallen into line, with one tiny inflection point. Reporter &lt;strong&gt;Caroline Tang&lt;/strong&gt; takes up the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Abbott gave diplomatic responses when asked about the controversial proposed changes to superannuation in the federal budget which will hit lifelong savers hard. \u201c&lt;strong&gt;There is a degree of anxiety about that particular budget announcement&lt;/strong&gt; but people are just as anxious about Labor\u2019s policy as they are about the Coalition\u2019s policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no easy way to get the deficit down. There is no painless way to cut government spending and what the government is trying to do here is to restore superannuation to its proper purpose. The proper purpose of superannuation is not to be a wealth creation vehicle, it\u2019s to be a vehicle for giving people a reasonable retirement income. So I think the government is absolutely on the right track and as I said, &lt;strong&gt;I think it\u2019s a gutsy call by the government&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T23:18:58.787Z\"&gt;12.18am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: His ministers have come out today saying that this was in the 1990s, it was a long time ago so isn\u2019t it fair, given that Chris Brown [Labor\u2019s candidate in Fremantle] also says this is something that happened to him when he was 18?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penny Wong:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the test is how long ago things occurred then I suppose that Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott will be apologising to Julia Gillard for the pursuit of her for matters which occurred 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T23:16:51.753Z\"&gt;12.16am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labor\u2019s campaign spokeswoman &lt;strong&gt;Penny Wong&lt;/strong&gt; has found the cameras now to pick up on the Panama Papers. She says &lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull &lt;/strong&gt;needs to provide full disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penny Wong:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the front page of one of today\u2019s major papers we have Malcolm Turnbull listed as being involved in a company established in a tax haven, a company which Mossack Fonseca established and a company that\u2019s involved in a Siberian gold mine, a company which allegedly made payments to Russian politicians about its activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I see in the papers that Mr Turnbull has had a spokesperson answer questions. Those answers seem to suggest \u2018I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t recall, it was a long time ago\u2019. Well, this is a man who is the prime minister of the country and he\u2019s running to be the prime minister again and the standards which are expected of him are high standards and he should provide a full and frank explanation of his involvement in this company which was established in a tax haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T23:11:48.774Z\"&gt;12.11am &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just tracking back to &lt;strong&gt;Mathias Cormann\u2019s&lt;/strong&gt; comments about the growth dividend from education funding, he\u2019s bouncing off &lt;a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/federal-election-2016-shorten-misled-voters-on-schools-boost-to-gdp/news-story/797a19aecb773e7a8212c56bf89f55fa\"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; in the Australian this morning by &lt;strong&gt;David Crowe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Shorten stands accused of misleading voters over the boost to growth from his $37.4bn school funding plan by claiming an economic lift \u201cstraight away\u201d from the spending, despite economic \u00adresearch that shows the gains would take decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blow to the opposition leader\u2019s economic case, the \u00adauthor of the global study used to justify the Labor spending told &lt;em&gt;The Australian &lt;/em&gt;there would be no \u201cimmediate\u201d boost to growth \u2014 and that more money was not the key \u00adfactor in producing the economic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T22:56:58.004Z\"&gt;11.56pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re off to the Mornington Peninsula Brewery in the electorate of Dunkley. The seat has become a marginal one after former small business minister &lt;strong&gt;Bruce Billson&lt;/strong&gt; retired in November, after Turnbull demoted him. But Billson\u2019s popularity in the electorate is key to the Liberals\u2019 success there, and Labor is now eyeing it off.

No, Cormann says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Does the prime minister have questions to answer over the Panama Papers?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, is the short answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is more than twenty years ago.

The morning news cycle for this campaign Thursday is exploding candidates: there\u2019s &lt;strong&gt;Chris Brown&lt;/strong&gt;, a former MUA official with undisclosed convictions who is Labor\u2019s candidate for Fremantle and perhaps won\u2019t be for much longer; and The Australian tells me there\u2019s a video in which the Greens candidate in Grayndler, &lt;strong&gt;Jim Casey,&lt;/strong&gt; is filmed saying he would prefer &lt;strong&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/strong&gt; to win the next election rather than &lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; because it would \u201cboost unions and ferment more protests.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus far &lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/strong&gt; being named in the Panama Papers hasn\u2019t really kicked hard into the news cycle, but it\u2019s only 8.30am, and the campaign spokespeople are only just getting under way. To the campaign road trains: &lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/strong&gt; is in Melbourne, then Adelaide, then Sydney, which sounds like a small intensification of activity. &lt;strong&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/strong&gt; is up north still, in Rockhampton I believe. It\u2019s also the Labor leader\u2019s birthday. Happy birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T22:34:32.156Z\"&gt;11.34pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that note my time with you this morning has drawn to a close and it is now time for &lt;strong&gt;Katharine Murphy &lt;/strong&gt;to fire up the keyboard. &lt;strong&gt;Mike Bowers &lt;/strong&gt;tells me &lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull\u2019&lt;/strong&gt;s bus has left the Melbourne CBD for an hour and twenty minute trip and is currently chugging along the Dandenong freeway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheerio &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T22:31:55.747Z\"&gt;11.31pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull &lt;/strong&gt;has been named in the Panama Papers though there are no allegations of improper conduct, in a story on the front page of the Australian Financial review today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arthur Sinodinos&lt;/strong&gt; has come out swinging against it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a dead horse being flogged, it\u2019s a 20 year matter, it\u2019s old news, they just want to run it because they can, the Fin Review on its front page should be debating policy instead of behaving like a downmarket tabloid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T22:30:15.612Z\"&gt;11.30pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arthur Sinodinos&lt;/strong&gt; just said the asylum seeker debate is not a political debate - to much laughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his criticisms of Labor candidates disagreeing with asylum policy, what is he suggesting, that they should be disendorsed for objecting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened within the Howard government is that we got the problem under control, and yes there\u2019s a Liberal philosophy and tradition you can without punishment express dissent [referring to Liberals who objected to offshore detention at the time]. What we are talking about here is Labor candidates lining up to say that as a matter of conscience they cannot support asylum seeker policy, as a matter of conscience they will unravel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two issues here, the Labor party has acted swiftly and appropriately, there are the convictions but there are also the lack of disclosure. If a candidate tells us then we weigh it up, if they don\u2019t disclose then that\u2019s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a candidate can\u2019t tell us we can\u2019t in good conscience put them forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T22:22:09.497Z\"&gt;11.22pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arthur Sinodinos&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Chris Bowen &lt;/strong&gt; are on radio national talking election strategy. Neither side has electrified the electorate this week, so what\u2019s the thinking in their camps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinodinos first:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a marathon not a sprint, we can\u2019t excite everyone everyday. If you have them in a pitch of excitement every day they will get exhausted. What both sides will do is keep rolling out policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are out there selling the budget and that\u2019s important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budgets can be a slow burn, we are going through process of explaining what\u2019s in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a two month campaign, which is very long, what we are doing is leading the policy debate. We are delighted to have a debate about education and we\u2019ve announced an eduction policy every day of this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Arthur says he\u2019s selling the budget, I was tempted to ask \u2018how\u2019s that going for him?\u2019 it\u2019s unravelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T22:03:19.654Z\"&gt;11.03pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/strong&gt; has started the morning with a yarn to none other than &lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt;.

But what we do know is that the minister says there has to be a real prospect of ongoing employment. Our advice indicates that for all intents and purposes it is an employment contract and they should be paid the minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it\u2019s unfortunate the government has used the term internship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all intents and purposes it should come under the Fair Work Act. To avoid exploitation of these workers, and they will be workers, it should be under the fair work act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paying employers to take on free labour, there is so much wrong with a plan like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T20:45:08.488Z\"&gt;9.45pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Di Natale &lt;/strong&gt;is not immune from the charms of &lt;strong&gt;Justin Trudeau&lt;/strong&gt;, it seems, and is modelling himself on the Canadian prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No question at all about that. He has shown, as have many other European examples, that you can have strong progressive values, that you can stand up to those big vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You just need to look at where the major party vote is and what it\u2019s been doing over a number of decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major party vote has been declining, the growth of the Greens has been continuing year on year on year ... That is the future for Australia. Multi-party government is the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T20:38:09.515Z\"&gt;9.38pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping us all in the loop at all times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Thanks Twitter - couldn't have got through the day without this news. &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/Oos0dO8ntJ\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Oos0dO8ntJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T20:34:12.732Z\"&gt;9.34pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Turnbull &lt;/strong&gt;will announce the first big spend of the campaign with $100m for border protection, ABC reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funding will go to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to scrutinise visa applications and minister &lt;strong&gt;Peter Dutton&lt;/strong&gt; is selling it as a policy to help weed out criminals and terrorists before they get to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"block-time published-time\"&gt; &lt;time datetime=\"2016-05-11T20:11:21.726Z\"&gt;9.11pm &lt;span class=\"timezone\"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day dawns with three stumbles already for candidates \u2013 from being dumped to being dropped down on the Senate ticket \u2013 but with the promise of a new day is the opportunity for the slate to be wiped clean, and for other candidates to have their moment in the spotlight and take the heat from those not exactly basking in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll be taking you through to 8.30am, when the good and golden &lt;strong&gt;Katharine Murphy&lt;/strong&gt; will be in to drive the blog campaign bus for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal advice sought by the peak union body suggests the PaTH program ... would leave vulnerable interns languishing below the legally enforceable minimum wage and potentially able to sue for recovery of unpaid wages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is avoiding using such phrases as \u2018helping the economy transition away from the mining boom\u2019, because it is further fuelling job insecurity in economically depressed regional and rural electorates.
