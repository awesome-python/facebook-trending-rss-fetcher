From start to finish, you are fully captivated by its narrative and the plight of the characters, namely Nathan \"Nate\" Drake. Through the clever writing over the years by Amy Hennig, Neil Druckmann, Tom Bissell and Josh Scherr as well as the outstanding voice acting by Nolan North, Nathan has come into his own as a video game icon, leaving the inspiration of Lara Croft and Tomb Raider far behind. </description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Co-operation is key in solid Alienation</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/DB/DB_20160510_alienation.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/DB/DB_20160510_alienation.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 18:01:15 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>Swedish developer Housemarque takes its twin-stick top-down shooter formula from 2010 title Dead Nation, and spices things up with loot drops, endless particle effects, and a ridiculous amount of aliens in the new PS4 exclusive Alienation. The final product doesn't quite reach the highs of some of the developer's previous games, but it still has a lot to offer.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Hitman Episode Two short-lived excitement</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/JP/JP_20160504_hitman2.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/JP/JP_20160504_hitman2.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Wed, 4 May 2016 18:01:15 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>In the second chapter of the episodic Hitman, Agent 47 finds himself in Sapienza with his lethal sights set on a wealthy bioengineer and his head egghead. Below his sprawling villa is a heavily guarded research laboratory housing a deadly virus prototype that targets people based on their DNA. Agent 47 has been tasked with not only offing the two scientists but he also must destroy the virus by any means necessary.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Star Fox Zero misses the mark</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/AC/AC_20160502_starfox.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/AC/AC_20160502_starfox.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Mon, 2 May 2016 18:01:15 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>A lot of ideas sound great on paper, but when implemented, do nothing more than crash and burn.

Still, we often forget to lock our computers when we walk away or purposely don't bother because it's too much of a pain to retype in a password every time you move to and fro. For this, Untethered Labs created Gatekeeper, a key fob sized wireless \"lock and key\" for your computer that automatically locks your computer when you walk away from it and unlocks it when you return.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Great Scott!

The baseball season is barely a few days old, but many fans of the sport have already put on their cleats and hit the basepaths thanks to the Sony-exclusive MLB The Show 16. It's a superb baseball sim once again in 2016, although it strikes out in one very significant way.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Great Scott!

While some narrative picky gamers, especially those with a refined palate for film, would go on to dissect the title\u2019s writing imperfections and plot inconsistencies, Heavy Rain still provided a gripping narrative chock full of gut-wrenching ultimatums, startling twists and enough on-screen prompts to make a DDR veteran gasp in awe. Now almost seven years after its initial release, the title is once again made available for PS4 owners. </description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Twilight Princess a shady remake</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/DB/DB_20160323_twilightprincess.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/DB/DB_20160323_twilightprincess.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2016 10:01:42 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>While the Zelda faithful waits impatiently for the next all-new adventure in the long-running series, Nintendo is hoping a steady stream of remakes will sate fans. The latest game to get that treatment is The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD, and like the Wind Waker HD before it, this remake is good fun, but hasn't aged as well as we hoped.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>G4TV Gaming News: Disney Infinity, Garden Warfare, Iron Maiden, Street Fighter V, Super Mario Maker</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/JP/JP_20160321_gaming_news.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/JP/JP_20160321_gaming_news.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2016 11:20:15 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>Disney Infinity expanding.

As protagonist Max Caulfield grows less and less ambivalent about her ability to undo time, she begins to develop a sense of self-righteousness, and flirts with the idea of using her power for more than just resolving trivial tasks.

The reason being is that the series hasn't really enjoyed the same acclaim as it did in its familiar 2D space. Then, one of 2010's most underrated games was released: Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. The gothic action epic proved to be a step in the right direction and demonstrated that if handled with care, the classic vampire thriller can indeed make the transition to 3D gracefully.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Mario Golf, a hole-in-one</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/JP/JP_201400502_mario_golf.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/JP/JP_201400502_mario_golf.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Fri, 2 May 2014 15:38:06 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>Whether it be Tiger Woods or John Daly on the box, whacking a white ball around a perfectly manicured lawn hasn't been my style.

Playing it in a video game form is  satisfying because I can not only play the way I want, but tennis also  translates well into a sports game in HD. Grand Slam Tennis 2 gets most of that  combination right, but some kinks get in the way.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>'Dillon' shows us the wimpy, wimpy west</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/DB/DB_20120321_dillon.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/DB/DB_20120321_dillon.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2012 15:49:31 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>The tower  defense genre may not be as popular as first person shooter or role-playing  games that have saturated the market in recent years, but it's not for lack of  quality or entertainment value.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Control almost any App's volume with SoundBunny</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/GG/GG_20120319_soundbunny.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/GG/GG_20120319_soundbunny.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2012 15:33:59 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>You're in the middle of recording a  podcast and that wretched e-mail alert interrupts you.

For almost 20 years, game developer Capcom has essentially been following the same formula. Sometimes though, a classic formula can't be topped. Rather than redo, Capcom has decided to redux the thrills of the early 1990s brawler for 'Super Street Fighter IV'. The results are nothing short of fantastic.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Apple iPad 3G is Magical</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/GG/GG_20100527_ipad.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/GG/GG_20100527_ipad.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Thur, 27 May 2010 17:16:22 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>After  being hands-on for the last 10 days with Apple iPad, Humphrey Bogart's line  from Casablanca best sums up the experience when he said, \"Louis, I think this  is the start of a beautiful friendship.\" Friends do things together and go places  together and the same holds true for the iPad, you'll want it to be with you  everywhere you go.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>'3D Dot Game Heroes' a one-dimensional homage</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/DB/DB_20100526_3ddotgameheroes.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/DB/DB_20100526_3ddotgameheroes.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2010 16:39:51 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>For those who grew up with a Nintendo Entertainment System and played the original 'Legend of Zelda' in its entirety over and over again, a visit to the original adventure across Hyrule is only a Wii Virtual Console download away.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Split/Second</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/TK/TK_20100518_splitsecond.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/TK/TK_20100518_splitsecond.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2010 16:19:36 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>One of the nice things about a game like Split/Second is that it seems to be so unlike anything that Disney Interactive would typically come out with.

Many of the highly-anticipated titles just didn't live up to the hype and left many gamers wanting more.

During the controversial level, you join a group of terrorists targeting an airport. As they walk through the terminal, they callously shoot any traveler they come across.

We then saw Mobile Internet-Ready which meant a dongle, a stick or and external adapter was needed to give you access to the mobile network.

Of all the upgrades, it is the new physics based gameplay engine that ranks 'Round 4' as the undisputed champion. When you are in the ring, everything about the experience feels natural and unrefined. Erroneously throwing an indiscriminate barrage of missed punches at your opponent does nothing but sap your strength, weaken your blows and your ability to defend yourself. 'Fight Night' requires you to pick your spots so that you can make each punch really count. There are moments where the haymakers fly fast and furious but for the most part, it is a game of precision and timing.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>[Prototype]: A great guilty pleasure</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/JP/JP_20090703_prototype.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/JP/JP_20090703_prototype.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Fri, 3 July 2009 11:44:25 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>The unapologetic anti-hero of Activision's '[Prototype]', the merciless Mercer is at the centre of a whirlwind government conspiracy involving the military, a lethal virus, a genetics company and lots and lots of snarling beasties.</description>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Hey Canada, You Can Now Pimp Your Flip</title>\r\n<link>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/GG/GG_20090630_flipmino.shtml</link>\r\n<guid>http://www.g4tv.ca/technews/GG/GG_20090630_flipmino.shtml</guid>\r\n<pubDate>Tue, 30 June 2009 14:13:12 GMT</pubDate>\r\n<description>While everything today seems to be mass-produced, it's nice to know that you can still get something personalized without paying through the nose.
