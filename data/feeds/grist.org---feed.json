Courtesy CF Operations/Handout via REUTERS\" /></p> <p>Fort McMurray, in Canada&#8217;s\u00a0Alberta province, is surrounded by two things: oil sands and boreal forests. And while the former <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/amid-fire-evacuations-alberta-oil-production-restarts/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">emerged from last week&#8217;s massive wildfire largely unscathed</a>, the latter is significantly threatened by the continuing flames. That fire\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/the-fort-mcmurray-disaster-read-the-latest-wednesday/article29930041/\">grew to nearly\u00a093,000 acres</a> after merging with a second wildfire on Tuesday, and is likely to\u00a0continue to burn for months. At the moment, it&#8217;s headed away from human civilization and\u00a0into the woods.</p>\n<p>That might sound like good news, but it&#8217;s actually quite bad for everyone\u00a0in the long run. In the past week, the volume\u00a0of emissions released by the Fort McMurray wildfire has mushroomed to the\u00a0equivalent to\u00a05 percent of Canada&#8217;s annual\u00a0greenhouse gas emissions, <a href=\"http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/carbon-release-in-wake-of-fort-mcmurray-wildfire-spikes-greenhouse-gasses\">reports the Edmonton Journal</a>. And scientists have long warned\u00a0that boreal forests \u2014 which run across\u00a0the northern hemisphere from Canada to Alaska, Russia, and Greenland \u2014 are crucial\u00a0to contain damage from climate change.</p>\n<p>How? For one thing, the world&#8217;s forests absorb a significant amount of the\u00a0carbon dioxide that humans release into the atmosphere. For another, boreal trees\u00a0contain huge deposits of CO2: about 75\u00a0tons of CO2 equivalents per acre, according to Canadian Forest Service research scientists quoted in the <a href=\"http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/carbon-release-in-wake-of-fort-mcmurray-wildfire-spikes-greenhouse-gasses\">Edmonton Journal</a>, which is emitted as the trees burn.\u00a0The problem isn&#8217;t limited to\u00a0trees, but the\u00a0&#8220;layers of moss, leaves, and other organic materials that insulate permafrost from surface heat,&#8221; as Yale&#8217;s <a href=\"http://e360.yale.edu/feature/a_new_global_tinderbox_the_worlds_boreal_forests/2916/\">environment360</a> project noted last year. And the <em>really</em> big fires melt permafrost \u2014 which\u00a0contains twice as much CO2\u00a0as the trees.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0world&#8217;s boreal forests, which make up one-third of all forests on the planet, are currently caught in\u00a0what <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/science/global-warming-cited-as-wildfires-increase-in-fragile-boreal-forest.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a>\u00a0calls\u00a0a &#8220;dangerous feedback loop.&#8221; Conditions exacerbated by\u00a0climate change,\u00a0such as El Ni\u00f1o, have created dry winters and turned fragile forest ecosystems into tinderboxes, as seen last year in Alaska (where <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/07/26/alaskas-terrifying-wildfire-season-and-what-it-says-about-climate-change/\">5 million acres of forest burned</a>)\u00a0and this year in Alberta, among other examples. Soot\u00a0from megafires\u00a0travels by wind and settles on ice caps, darkening them and making them absorb more heat from the sun and melt more rapidly; this, reports the Times, was a contributing factor to Greenland&#8217;s ice sheet melting nearly entirely in 2012.</p>\n<p>To sum up: Wildfires\u00a0both directly contribute CO2\u00a0to the atmosphere <em>and</em> hinder\u00a0forests&#8217;\u00a0ability to absorb CO2\u00a0for years to come.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Climate &amp; Energy</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/news/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">News</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/science/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Science</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331614&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/rtx2d0ai.jpg?w=170\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/rtx2d0ai.jpg?w=170\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">A Canadian Joint Operations Command aerial photo shows wildfires in Fort McMurray Alberta Canada</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Gates Foundation quietly dumps all of its BP stock</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/climate-energy/gates-foundation-quietly-dumps-all-of-its-bp-stock/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:16:38 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Melissa Cronin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Business & Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate & Energy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justice]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331603</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Bill Gates has criticized the fossil fuel divestment movement, but he\u2019s selling off oil shares anyway.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331603&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/billgates.jpg?w=1600&amp;h=900&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-grist-super size-grist-super wp-post-image\" alt=\"Bill Gates\" /></p> <p>Has the world\u2019s largest charitable foundation started shifting away from fossil fuels?</p>\n<p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sold off its $187 million stake in the oil giant BP sometime between September and December of 2015, according to a recent filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The move came after the foundation sold off $824 million in ExxonMobil stock, as disclosed last fall.</p>\n<p>The foundation has been under pressure from climate activists demanding that it drop all investments in fossil fuel companies. The Guardian\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/mar/16/keep-it-in-the-ground-guardian-climate-change-campaign\">Keep It in the Ground</a>&#8221; campaign and the <a href=\"http://www.gatesdivest.org/\">Gates Divest</a>\u00a0campaign have both been particularly dogged in focusing on Gates.</p>\n<p>But the foundation has refused to comment on its investment decisions, so the significance of these recent oil-stock sell-offs is unclear. Bill Gates, the billionaire cofounder of Microsoft, has been skeptical of the fossil-fuel divestment movement and last year\u00a0called it a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/14/bill-gates-calls-fossil-fuel-divestment-a-false-solution\">false solution</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to public records, the Gates Foundation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/19/gates-foundation-has-14bn-in-fossil-fuels-investments-guardian-analysis\">held about $1.4 billion</a> of investments in coal, oil, and gas companies at the start of 2014. Now it holds only about $200 million of those stocks, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/12/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-divests-entire-holding-in-bp?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">the Guardian</a> \u2014 though it may have made new fossil fuel investments that haven&#8217;t been publicly disclosed.</p>\n<p>Given the <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Coal-industry-struggles-with-structural-decline-outlook-negative--PR_348515?WT.mc_id=AM~RmluYW56ZW4ubmV0X1JTQl9SYXRpbmdzX05ld3NfTm9fVHJhbnNsYXRpb25z~20160506_PR_348515\">big troubles</a> the coal industry is facing right now, and the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shale-telecoms-idUSKCN0XV07V\">volatility</a> in the oil and gas sector, it&#8217;s the perfect time for investors like Gates to get out.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/business-technology/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Business &amp; Technology</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Climate &amp; Energy</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/justice/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Justice</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/news/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">News</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/politics/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Politics</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331603&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/billgates.jpg?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/billgates.jpg?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Bill Gates</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>T.

Methane, which is the main component of natural gas, had previously been unregulated. There&#8217;s a mounting pile of evidence suggesting that as the United States relies increasingly on gas to produce electricity, methane emissions are\u00a0</span><a style=\"line-height:1.5;\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/methane-emissions-aliso-canyon\" target=\"_blank\">much higher</a><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> than most people expected them to be.</span></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a problem for the fight against climate change. Methane emissions are far lower than carbon dioxide emissions, and methane survives in the atmosphere for a relatively short period of time. But methane is far more effective at trapping heat than CO2 is, which makes it a significant near-term warming threat. As I <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/03/did-fracking-ruin-obamas-climate-legacy\" target=\"_blank\">reported in a deep dive on methane</a> yesterday:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When unburned methane leaks into the atmosphere, it can help cause dramatic warming in a relatively short period of time. Methane emissions have long been a missing piece in the country&#8217;s patchwork climate policy \u2026</p>\n<p>The natural gas system produces methane emissions at nearly every step of the process, from the well itself to the pipe that carries gas into your home. Around two-thirds of those emissions are &#8220;intentional,&#8221; meaning they occur during normal use of equipment. For example, some pneumatic gauges use the pressure of natural gas to flip on or off and emit tiny puffs of methane when they do so. The other one-third comes from so-called &#8220;fugitive&#8221; emissions, aka leaks, that happen when a piece of equipment cracks or otherwise fails.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The lack of regulations on methane was one reason why President Barack Obama&#8217;s climate strategy, which hinges on swapping the country&#8217;s coal consumption for natural gas, has been frowned upon by some environmentalists. Even today&#8217;s regulations are <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/01/climate-change-methane-obama-criticism\" target=\"_blank\">just partial solution</a>, since they only apply to new and modified natural gas infrastructure, not systems that already exist. And by some analysts&#8217; reckoning, more than 70 percent of gas-sector methane emissions from now until 2025 will come from sources that already exist.</p>\n<p>Still, the regulation announced today achieves one of the final remaining big items on Obama&#8217;s climate checklist. It aims to reduce gas-sector methane emissions 40-45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025 by tightening the allowed emissions from pumps, compressors, wells, and other infrastructure; requiring more frequent surveys for leaks; and implementing a data-gathering survey that will give officials and companies a better understanding of just how much methane leakage there really is. The EPA expects the regulations to cost $530 million by 2025, but produce $690 million in environmental benefits.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Climate &amp; Energy</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/news/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">News</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/politics/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Politics</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331597&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/obama.jpg?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/obama.jpg?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">obama</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Listen to this relaxing jam on a sunny afternoon</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/living/listen-to-this-relaxing-jam-on-a-sunny-afternoon/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:00:01 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Grist staff]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Article]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Living]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331346</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Watch Sam Cohen perform a tune from last year's Pickathon music festival.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331346&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://grist.org/series/pickathon/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-285095 size-full\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/gristpresentspickathon3.jpg?w=240&#038;h=178\" alt=\"Grist presents Pickathon on the Farm\" width=\"240\" height=\"178\" /></a></p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='630' height='385' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/CIYhh_VAn88?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>If you zone out while listening to &#8220;The Garden&#8221; by singer-songwriter Sam Cohen, we don&#8217;t blame you.

So portable, delicious, and convenient. However, I recently read that the clementines and mandarins that come from California are watered with fracking wastewater. Is this true? If so, are there any organic clementines available? Do the organic standards take into account what type of water is used in the growing of fruits and vegetables?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Elizabeth R.</strong><br />\n<strong>Chicago, Ill.</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"QA\">A.</span> Dearest Elizabeth,</p>\n<p>Oh, I love clementines too: They rival bananas for mess-free packability, they\u2019re oh-so-easy to eat, yummy, and stuffed with Vitamin C, plus, yes, they\u2019re <a href=\"http://www.sunpacific.com/images/cutiesboxw214.jpg\">darn cute</a>. So it\u2019s disturbing indeed to imagine these perky mini-fruits hiding a dark secret. (Well, a secret any darker than what <a href=\"http://grist.org/food/florida-citrus-growers-binge-on-pesticides-endangering-bees/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">already haunts</a> most citrus products.) Let\u2019s peel back the uh, peel and take a closer look, shall we?</p>\n<p>First off: Yes, as Grist and other outlets have written before, some California crops are indeed irrigated with water from the state&#8217;s oilfields. But &#8220;fracking wastewater&#8221; it&#8217;s not, not quite: There&#8217;s not much fracking going on in the area in question, and in any case, wastewater from that particular extraction method must be injected back underground, <a href=\"https://www.kcet.org/redefine/our-food-is-not-being-grown-with-fracking-wastewater\">not reused</a>. And it&#8217;s not exactly &#8220;waste&#8221; water, either: We&#8217;re dealing with what&#8217;s called <a href=\"http://aqwatec.mines.edu/produced_water/intro/pw/\">produced water</a>, or water sucked up in the course of oil and gas drilling ops. This water undergoes <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/05/05/3654388/california-drought-oil-wastewater-agriculture/\">treatment</a> before it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/research/AWT/reportpdfs/report157.pdf\">allowed near</a> any crops, but it isn&#8217;t thoroughly tested for toxics.</p>\n<p>If this fact finds you feeling less comforted and more wanting to drop your clementine in horror, Elizabeth, I have more unsettling news for you. Oilfield byproducts have been watering our crops for <a href=\"http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/04/28/california-farmer-says-orchards-irrigated-oilfield-wastewater/\">20 years</a> or so, and not just adorable citrus fruits: This water is also used to grow pistachios, grapes, tangerines, and <a href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/01/13/farms-using-oilfield-wastewater-under-review-for-food-safety/\">almonds</a>. Which brings us to your larger question: Is all of this okay?</p>\n<p>I posed your question to several experts, and this appears to be a matter of what we don&#8217;t know <em>can </em>hurt us &#8212; maybe. &#8220;We cannot say definitively that there are or are not any dangerous chemical additives in the produced water or in the produce, because we have never tested for them and because companies are not mandated to disclose what and how much of these chemicals they use,&#8221; says Dr. Seth B.C. Shonkoff, executive director of PSE Healthy Energy, visiting scholar at UC-Berkeley, and a member of a <a href=\"http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/water_issues/oil_fields/food_safety/meetings/2016_0112_fs_of_water_proj_charter.pdf\">state food safety panel</a> looking into this very issue. &#8220;We do know there are lots of chemicals going into oil wells, which go into produced water, which is sent to irrigation. Monitoring happens infrequently and there&#8217;s no monitoring of any of the chemical additives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Not exactly appetizing, is it?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, avoiding oilfield-watered produce gets a bit tricky. USDA organic standards <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2015/08/organic-crops-can-be-irrigated-fracking-wastewater\">will be of no help</a>, as they don&#8217;t cover irrigation water used on organic crops. And though we know <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/07/oil-wastewater-fruits-vegetables-farms\">a few brands</a> that raise their citrus and nuts using oilfield water, companies often source widely, and it&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s guess where any given orange in your clementine box came from. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say stop eating citrus and almonds and pistachios,&#8221; says Shonkoff. &#8220;But if I knew a given crop was grown with oilfield produced water, I&#8217;d buy a different product.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s pause here for a familiar but especially relevant plug: support your local farmers. When you meet your growers at the farmers&#8217; market, you can ask them directly what they use for irrigation. Buying and eating locally also helps support the economy in your area and cuts down on the impacts of shipping fruit all over the dang country. We should all eat locally as much as we possibly can.</p>\n<p>If you find you still need your clementine fix, Elizabeth, I suppose you could look for fruits grown elsewhere, but that doesn&#8217;t address the root issue. The only way to ensure that your foods are free of weird chemicals, drilling-related or otherwise, is to ask questions &#8212; and then to stand up and yell for change. &#8220;The great power here is in banding together and demanding answers,&#8221; says Scott Smith, chief technology officer and investigator for the California nonprofit <a href=\"https://waterdefense.org/\">Water Defense</a>. &#8220;The more consumers who ask questions right to the companies, the better. Can you tell us where these are grown? What kind of water is irrigating it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot consumers can do from a larger policy perspective&#8221; as well, adds Shonkoff. &#8220;Demand that there be independent scientific studies on this produced water before it&#8217;s deployed to irrigate crops.&#8221; This is especially important now, as California&#8217;s persistent drought means officials are considering expanding this kind of water reuse. So get busy calling, emailing, and tweeting at your favorite brands, get in touch with California&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/water_issues/oil_fields/food_safety/index.shtml\">water quality control boards</a>, and tell your friends, too. Because although we are normally in favor of Reusing and Recycling here at Ask Umbra Headquarters, this is one practice that seems more than a little seedy.</p>\n<p>Drippily,<br />\nUmbra</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/food/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Food</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/living/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Living</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331566&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://grist.org/food/dont-look-now-oil-industry-poisoning-food/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/clementine_almonds-e1463018365353.jpg?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/clementine_almonds-e1463018365353.jpg?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">clementine_almonds</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Amid fire evacuations, Alberta oil production restarts</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/climate-energy/amid-fire-evacuations-alberta-oil-production-restarts/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://grist.org/climate-energy/amid-fire-evacuations-alberta-oil-production-restarts/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 09:05:10 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Xian Chiang-Waren]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Article]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Cities]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate & Energy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331344</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Companies are flying in workers to staff oil operations \u2014 because thousands of local workers have had to leave their homes.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331344&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/rtx2d71x.jpg?w=1600&amp;h=900&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-grist-super size-grist-super wp-post-image\" alt=\"A plane flies low to dump fire retardant on wildfires near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.

Any quipster with a keyboard and internet access can coin a new one.

With the rise of climatarian, reducetarian, and sustainatarian,\u00a0we&#8217;re taking into account how our food choices affect others.</p>\n<h2><b>The -arian explosion</b></h2>\n<p>These new identities allow people to unite around something that signals to others that they take their food choices very seriously, says\u00a0Samuel Boerboom, an expert in political language and communication and author of <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Political-Language-Food-Samuel-Boerboom/dp/1498505554\">The Political Language of Food</a>. </i>In other words, these eaters won&#8217;t just scarf any old grub. Their diets require mission statements and methodology.</p>\n<p>Our current diet words\u00a0&#8212; meat-eater, vegetarian, vegan &#8212; don&#8217;t necessarily capture the nuances of ethical eating. So people started looking for new words.</p>\n<p>Brian Kateman, founder and CEO of the <a href=\"http://reducetarian.org/\">Reducetarian Foundation</a>, said\u00a0that we\u00a0tend to\u00a0see meat consumption as an \u201call-or-nothing premise.\u201d\u00a0To fill the gap between vegetarian and meat-eater, Kateman came up with\u00a0<em>reducetarian</em> &#8212; someone\u00a0who decreases the amount of meat in their diet no matter the motivation. He points out that reducing a person&#8217;s\u00a0meat consumption from 200 pounds a year to 160 makes a much bigger impact\u00a0than turning someone who already\u00a0eats very little meat into a textbook vegetarian.</p>\n<p>Inspired by reducetarian, Mark Pershin, founder and CEO of Australian nonprofit\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.lessmeatlessheat.org/\">Less Meat Less Heat</a>,\u00a0coined a word of his own. <em>Climatarian</em> describes someone who eats less meat, particularly\u00a0emissions-intensive kinds\u00a0like beef, for climate\u00a0reasons.\u00a0Pershin felt that reducetarian\u00a0left out the motivation for reducing meat consumption &#8212; a reduction he says is crucial to keep us\u00a0within the proposed limit of 2 degrees C of warming.</p>\n<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more!\u00a0While\u00a0researching these words, I received an email from Maxwell Strotbeck, a University of North Carolina Wilmington graduate, who advocated a new term: <em>sustainatarian</em>, a person who cuts their intake\u00a0of animal products\u00a0and minimizes food waste. (And both Strotbeck and Pershin later found out that the words they had respectively &#8220;coined&#8221; had already been floating around on the web.)</p>\n<p>These words are the intersection of two American obsessions: who we are and what we eat. It&#8217;s no coincidence that Dictionary.com named &#8220;identity&#8221; the <a href=\"http://time.com/4139350/dictionary-2015-word-of-the-year/\">word of the year</a> in 2015.\u00a0<a href=\"http://qz.com/568567/dictionary-coms-very-political-word-of-the-year/\">Quartz</a>\u00a0points out that\u00a0our culture\u2019s heightened obsession with identity is a political one, often linked to gender, sexuality, and race.\u00a0Is it possible that food choice is taking on a political dimension, too, and our vocabulary is scrambling to catch up?</p>\n<p>As Boerboom likes to say,\u00a0&#8220;You vote for an elected official every few years, but you vote for political conscience three times a day.&#8221;</p>\n<h2><b>Humor and hipsters</b></h2>\n<p>If you think all of this sounds like the premise of a <i>Portlandia </i>sketch, you&#8217;re not alone.\u00a0These words strike us as funny for some obvious reasons: Since they\u2019re new, they surprise us. And they\u2019re ungainly: <em>Reducetarian</em> clocks in at a stocky six syllables.</p>\n<p>Boerboom says these words tend to come across as a &#8220;hipster&#8221; &#8212; an attempt to distinguish oneself\u00a0from the crowd and appear ironic or cool. (Hence the <i>Portlandia</i> vibe.) A good case in point: this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXIdcA6mlV4\">satirical video about a \u201cfrutarian\u201d</a>\u00a0who thinks it\u2019s cruel to cook fruits and vegetables because they \u201chave feelings,\u201d pointed out by <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climatarian-food-identities_us_5696caace4b0b4eb759d1e34\">The Huffington Post</a>.</p>\n<p>Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist at UC Berkeley, wrote in an email that the <i>-arian </i>suffix has many uses (think <i>veterinarian</i>) but that the relevant meaning here is a \u201ctrue believer in a cult or doctrine,\u201d like <i>unitarian</i>. He says these words are funny because they turn a special liking for something into dogma, noting that they sound \u201cself-mocking, self-inflating, or derisive \u2014 or sometimes a little of each, depending on who\u2019s talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Boerboom says this conclusion is common in the academic sphere, but it overlooks the sincerity behind these words: \u201cI think it really, really reduces the complexity of these identities, in that so many people, for so long, have felt that part of their political identity is food-based, but have just lacked the vocabulary to express it.\u201d</p>\n<h2><b>The future of\u00a0diet-based identities</b></h2>\n<p>Boerboom says that too many competing identities present the danger of losing political solidarity. \u201cThat\u2019s where the sort of \u2018true believer\u2019 identity is problematic,\u201d he says. But the trailblazers behind reducetarian, climatarian, and sustainatarian hesitate to pit the movements against one another, even though each has faith in his own darling creation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I started the Reducetarian Foundation, I said we would be successful when reducetarian was in a registered dictionary,\u201d says Kateman. \u201cIn a few years, hopefully we\u2019ll see that happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pershin is similarly optimistic, saying he believes climatarian &#8212; named one of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/dining/new-food-words.html?ref=dining&amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;_r=1\">New York Times</a> top 10 food words of 2015 &#8212; will become part of the vernacular. \u201cUltimately, I see a vision of restaurants around the world offering climatarian options,\u201d Pershin says.</p>\n<p>Strotbeck admits that sustainatarianism is still a fledgling movement but hopes all three of these movements will band together to influence policy in the years to come. Sustainatarian made it into <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sustainatarian\">Urban Dictionary</a> years ago, but it has not yet make a blip on Google Trends:</p>\n\t\t<form id=\"wpcom-iframe-form-2e3a7d0a0f35ed4819f5d73de186b0b4-5735725f83d93\" target=\"wpcom-iframe-2e3a7d0a0f35ed4819f5d73de186b0b4-5735725f83d93\" method=\"post\" action=\"//wpcomwidgets.com/?wpcom_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fgrist.wordpress.com\" style=\"display: none\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"width\" value=\"\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"height\" value=\"\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frameborder\" value=\"0\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"style\" value=\"\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"class\" value=\"\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"scrolling\" value=\"no\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" value=\"\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"mozallowfullscreen\" value=\"\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"resize\" value=\"0\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"replace_attributes\" value=\"1\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"fallback\" value=\"&lt;p class=&quot;protected-embed-fallback&quot;&gt;This embed is invalid&lt;/p&gt;\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_data\" value=\"PHNjcmlwdCB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiIHNyYz0iLy93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvZW1iZWQuanM/aGw9ZW4tVVMmYW1wO3E9cmVkdWNldGFyaWFuLCtjbGltYXRhcmlhbiwrc3VzdGFpbmF0YXJpYW4mYW1wO2NtcHQ9cSZhbXA7dHo9RXRjL0dNVCUyQjcmYW1wO3R6PUV0Yy9HTVQlMkI3JmFtcDtjb250ZW50PTEmYW1wO2NpZD1USU1FU0VSSUVTX0dSQVBIXzAmYW1wO2V4cG9ydD01JmFtcDt3PTY2MCZhbXA7aD0zMzAiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pg==,6041da6d349690821210f59fc35f492bb111cd7c\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_tag\" value=\"protected-iframe\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_hash\" value=\"2e3a7d0a0f35ed4819f5d73de186b0b4\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</form>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<iframe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname=\"wpcom-iframe-2e3a7d0a0f35ed4819f5d73de186b0b4-5735725f83d93\"\n\t\t\tid=\"wpcom-iframe-2e3a7d0a0f35ed4819f5d73de186b0b4-5735725f83d93\"\n\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen\t\t\tclass=\"wpcom-protected-iframe \"\n\t\t></iframe>\n\t\t\n\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-2e3a7d0a0f35ed4819f5d73de186b0b4-5735725f83d93');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-2e3a7d0a0f35ed4819f5d73de186b0b4-5735725f83d93');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-2e3a7d0a0f35ed4819f5d73de186b0b4-5735725f83d93'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'DOMContentLoaded', func, false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t</script>\n\t\t\n<p>Boerboom is skeptical: &#8220;Most of these identities will remain marginal,&#8221; he says.

The corporations had drafted a ballot proposition exempting them from some of the public safety rules governing taxis in the city and then thrown an unprecedented amount of money and clout into trying to get their way. Their hubris, it seems, rubbed Austinites the wrong way.</p>\n<p>Despite the validity of some of their concerns, Uber and Lyft\u2019s approach casts a negative light on the ride-hailing industry &#8212; an industry with the potential to do much good, from <a href=\"http://www.fox7austin.com/news/local-news/57935567-story\">decreasing drunk driving</a> to increasing mobility and <a href=\"http://grist.org/cities/why-cabs-and-car-sharing-are-good-for-the-environment/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">reducing car dependence</a>, thereby helping the environment.</p>\n<p>Proposition 1 would have repealed certain requirements the city council voted to impose in December, most notably that ride-hail drivers would have to pass fingerprinting background checks, and that ride-hail cars would not be allowed to stop in traffic to pick up and drop off passengers. Taxi drivers in the city are already bound by these same rules, though with some important caveats. Prop. 1\u00a0lost, 56 to 44 percent.</p>\n<p><strong>What the\u00a0fight is\u00a0about</strong></p>\n<p>The city says the fingerprinting checks are necessary to ensure that drivers won\u2019t prey on riders. Uber has drawn <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/internal-data-offers-glimpse-at-uber-sex-assault-complaints?utm_term=.sa3xqQ7NJ#.xcW63myq5\">accusations</a> of a high rate of sexual assault by drivers, a claim the company disputes. Austin Mayor Steven Adler (no relation to this reporter) <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/3/16/11587036/meet-austin-mayor-steve-adler-the-guy-caught-between-a-rock-and-uber\">told</a> tech site Recode in March, \u201cWe were also hearing that fingerprinting would be helpful, from [rape crisis centers and victim advocacy organizations], who reported a sudden and dramatic increase in the number of women, mostly young women, who were victims or were coming forward as victims of sexual assault.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uber maintains that its system for weeding out criminals is already better than the system Austin uses for its city-licensed cab drivers. The city\u2019s fingerprint-based background checks for cabbies only use statewide databases, so applicants with an out-of-state criminal record could slip through the cracks. Uber uses a name-based background check, but it\u2019s national. Last fall, Uber <a href=\"http://kxan.com/2015/10/27/uber-drivers-who-failed-its-background-check-have-austin-issued-permit/\">reported</a> that of 163 Austin taxicab drivers who applied to Uber, 53, or nearly a third, failed Uber\u2019s background check process. Nineteen had serious convictions, such as felony assaults and drunk driving. \u201cThere is no perfect system, and we\u2019re not saying our system is perfect,\u201d Jaime Moore, a spokeswoman for Uber, tells Grist. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to stand up for the credibility of our background checks.\u201d</p>\n<p>As to why Uber is so resistant to fingerprinting background checks, the company argues that such checks are racially biased because fingerprinting is done at the time of arrest, rather than conviction, and racist policing leads to far more unfounded arrests of African-Americans and Latinos than of whites. It\u2019s not just ride-hail companies making this point: The Austin chapters of the NAACP and the Urban League <a href=\"http://kut.org/post/groups-say-fingerprint-based-background-checks-could-lead-racial-discrimination\">oppose</a> fingerprinting background checks of ride-hail drivers for this reason.</p>\n<p>On the issue of picking up and dropping off in traffic, the ride-hail companies say that because there are no empty parking spaces in centrally located areas at busy times, there is no other way for riders to get in and out of their cars. The city says taxis are not allowed to stop in traffic and ride-hail cars shouldn\u2019t be allowed to either. But Uber says there\u2019s a loophole for taxis: The relevant city ordinance for taxicabs requires them to \u201cdrive to the right-hand sidewalk as nearly as possible,\u201d but the \u201cas nearly as possible\u201d proviso wasn\u2019t offered to ride-hail cars.</p>\n<p>The Austin police and firefighters unions, for their part, were concerned enough about cars blocking traffic lanes that they opposed the Uber-backed ballot measure, contending it could threaten public safety. It\u2019s possible that ride-hail drivers, who are often part-timers with little experience, are not as good at getting out of the way of traffic as full-time cabbies.</p>\n<p>Uber and Lyft spent $9 million promoting their ballot proposition, offered free rides to the polls to their customers, and used aggressive direct outreach techniques like spamming Austinites with text messages. Their opponents <a href=\"http://www.kvue.com/news/local/austin-pac-calls-for-uber-lyft-campaign-tactics-to-be-investigated/171452370\">called for</a> government investigation into whether some of these activities violated campaign finance laws.</p>\n<p><strong>Uber and Lyft pack up and go home</strong></p>\n<p>The companies threatened to leave Austin unless the requirement for fingerprint background checks was dropped. On Monday, they made good on their threat and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/08/technology/uber-lyft-austin-vote-fingerprinting/\">shut down</a> operations in the city.</p>\n<p>That is a real loss for Austin, as it lacks reliable, alternative on-demand car services. When I went there in 2013, ride-hailing hadn\u2019t come to town yet. Taxis were hard to find and my host told me they cannot be counted on to come when called by phone. Getting to the airport early in the morning, before the buses started running, was seriously stressful and required lugging my bag to an informal taxi stand on the street in front of a major hotel.</p>\n<p>Opponents of the ballot proposition say Uber and Lyft were trying to steamroll the city with their money and bully it by threatening to leave. \u201cThe amount of spending was shocking,\u201d Jason Stanford, communications director for Mayor Adler, told Grist. \u201cIt was about nine times more than anyone has ever spent in a campaign in the city. There were a lot of points along the way where people perceived this not as a campaign but more of a threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adler says he wants ride-hailing services in town, just not at the expense of protecting the public. The mayor\u2019s office says it tried negotiating more flexible solutions with Uber and Lyft, but the companies refused to come to the table. \u201cThe mayor recognized that these companies see themselves as different from taxis even though they provide a similar function,\u201d says Stanford. \u201cHe saw an opportunity for government to innovate, as they have to in order to adjust to economic change. We have to figure out what is the proper way to regulate the sharing economy.\u201d So, for example, instead of mandatory fingerprinting and background checks conducted by the government, the mayor proposed optional checks performed by a third party. Drivers who chose to participate would be given access to more desirable pick-up areas, such as a preferential line at the airport.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe mayor believes that Austin needs TNCs [transportation network companies],\u201d says Stanford. \u201cEveryone on the city council says they are welcome to come back. [Mayor Adler] invites them to the table.\u201d Stanford says that City Hall got tons of calls on Monday from residents who are angry that Uber and Lyft have left Austin. But, he adds, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten a lot of calls from other TNC providers who are interested in coming into Austin.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that is where Uber and Lyft overplayed their hand. There are other ride-hail companies out there, and new ones will be created. Someone will abide by the rules in Austin if the big players won\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Uber, especially, is used to getting its way. It entered the Austin market illegally, as it has done in many cities, and forced the city to write rules to catch up to its presence. It has flexed its political and economic muscle to intimidate cities before. Last year, it <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/23/nyregion/de-blasio-administration-dropping-plan-for-uber-cap-for-now.html\">forced</a> New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to give up a plan to limit the number of ride-hail cars (though Uber has grudgingly acceded to fingerprint background checks in New York). In San Antonio, Uber and Lyft left because of the fingerprinting issue, only to <a href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Uber-returning-to-San-Antonio-immediately-6568842.php\">return</a> after striking a compromise with the city that made fingerprint checks voluntary, similar to what Adler proposes.</p>\n<p>Uber and Lyft are widely perceived as disrespectful of the law and manipulative of the democratic process, which reinforces other concerns that progressives have about the companies. Uber is accused of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jul/14/hillary-clinton-criticises-the-uber-business-model-for-exploiting-workers\">exploiting drivers</a>, and has been fighting <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2016/05/04/will-a-new-class-action-suit-change-uber-or-cause-drivers-to-permanently-lose/#139a58f9277a\">class-action suits</a> over the issue. One of Uber\u2019s senior executives <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists\">proposed</a> investigating and publicizing the private lives of journalists who have been critical of the company.</p>\n<p>In Austin, Adler contends, the companies refused to compromise. \u201cI think the ballot initiative fight here was premature,\u201d Adler <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/3/16/11587036/meet-austin-mayor-steve-adler-the-guy-caught-between-a-rock-and-uber\">told</a> Recode. \u201cI think we could have worked through this in a way that would have avoided controversy.\u201d But the companies plowed ahead with the ballot proposition, and that triggered a backlash. \u201cWhen it\u2019s anyone versus Austin, Austin\u2019s going to vote for Austin,\u201d says Stanford.</p>\n<p>If Uber and Lyft are smart, they\u2019ll learn from their failure in Austin and work with local governments instead of trying to bully them into submission. That would be good for their companies and for the ride-hailing sector in general. But so far they have shown no sign of changing their attitude: Uber and Lyft are currently <a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/columnists/tomlinson/article/The-problem-is-with-Uber-and-Lyft-not-city-rules-7450937.php?t=b3976d9f90438d9cbb&amp;cmpid=twitter-premium&amp;utm_content=buffer0742a&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">pushing</a> for the conservative Texas state legislature to pass a bill that would undermine local regulations and let them get their way.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/business-technology/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Business &amp; Technology</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/cities/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Cities</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/politics/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Politics</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331578&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/anti-uber-sign-reuters-c.jpg?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/anti-uber-sign-reuters-c.jpg?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">anti-uber-sign-reuters-c</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Keystone pipeline still a pain in nation\u2019s butt</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/business-technology/keystone-pipeline-still-a-pain-in-nations-butt/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 22:22:38 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Katie Herzog]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Article]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Business & Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate & Energy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331454</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Pipeline boosters just won\u2019t give up.

Pipeline company TransCanada <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/transcanada-if-we-cant-build-keystone-we-want-15-billion/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">filed the suit</a> in federal court in January, arguing that Obama exceeded his\u00a0constitutional authority when he denied\u00a0a permit for Keystone. (Also in January, TransCanada <a href=\"http://www.transcanada.com/announcements-article.html?id=2014960&amp;t=\">filed</a>\u00a0a separate claim under NAFTA arguing that the U.S. should pay the company\u00a0more than $15 billion to compensate it for\u00a0&#8220;costs and damages that it has suffered&#8221; because of Obama&#8217;s decision.

On Tuesday, Royal Dutch Shell formally gave up on its decade-long attempt of striking oil in the Arctic\u2019s icy waters, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/shell-relinquishes-offshore-leases-alaskas-chukchi-sea-39014007\">relinquishing</a> all but one of its oil and gas leases off of Alaska&#8217;s northwest coast. Last fall, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/shell-ceases-alaska-arctic-drilling-exploratory-well-oil-gas-disappoints\">abandoned its drilling plans</a> in the Chukchi Sea for the \u201cforeseeable\u201d future, and President Barack Obama\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/barack-obama-arctic-oil-drilling-214899\">canceled </a>new oil and gas leases there, too.</p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean offshore drilling is slowing down.</p>\n<p>The Gulf of Mexico, long an epicenter of offshore drilling, is still wide open &#8212; and its oil and gas production is growing. There are currently more than 5,000 offshore active oil and natural gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/674669.pdf\">according</a> to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). More than two-thirds of these leases are for deep water drilling.</p>\n<p>The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2016/04/end_new_oil_drilling_activists.html\">hammering out the final details</a> for its five-year leasing plan, which will determine offshore areas that are fair game for oil exploration from 2017 to 2022. Right now, BOEM has proposed 10 <a href=\"http://www.boem.gov/Five-Year-Program-2017-2022/\">new lease sales</a>\u00a0in the Gulf. The 45-million-acre area, said to contain the <a href=\"http://www.ran.org/rainforest_action_network_statement_on_anticipated_2017_2022_plan_for_offshore_oil_and_gas_leases\">eighth-largest carbon reserve</a> on Earth, will remain open to drilling unless the Obama administration changes its gameplan.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Gulf drilling is not going to cease unless another catastrophic disaster happens,\u201d said Tyler Priest, a University of Iowa environmental historian who studies oil and energy, referring to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill that dumped <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/14/us/gulf-oil-spill-unknowns/\">4.2 million barrels of oil</a> into the Gulf. According to the Energy Information Administration, the Gulf supplies <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/special/gulf_of_mexico/\">17 percent</a> of the country\u2019s total crude oil.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So why is the oil business thriving in the Gulf while it&#8217;s\u00a0largely faltered in the Arctic?</p>\n<p>The reasons for the Gulf\u2019s successes, according to Priest, can be attributed to the wealth of infrastructure already in place, the extensive network of pipelines and coastal refineries, and the seemingly endless stream of new oil reserve discoveries.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a totally different region from the Arctic, which is a long way away from infrastructure,\u201d he told Grist, adding that companies can\u2019t drill year-round in the Arctic. \u201cBut the Gulf just keeps on giving.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Offshore oil has dominated for nearly 80 years. In 1938, <a href=\"http://aoghs.org/offshore-history/offshore-oil-history/\">Pure Oil and Superior Oil Company</a>, now part of ExxonMobil, propped up the first oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico &#8212; a freestanding wooden deck &#8212; about a mile off the shore of Creole, La.</p>\n<p>Offshore oil enterprises in the Gulf are relatively protected from oil prices fluctuating than other energy sources, Priest explained, because the infrastructure needed to support them is already so well-developed. So while oil prices are cheap and taking a toll on oil prospects nationwide, oil and gas production in the Gulf is expected to hit a record <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=25892\">1.82 million barrels per day</a> in 2016 and 2017.</p>\n<p>But there is one other variable that could put a stopper on the oil streaming out of the Gulf.

In a case pitting BP against the state&#8217;s Department of Revenue, the Court <a href=\"https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Court_Probation/Supreme_Court/Opinions/2013/13SC996.pdf\">decided</a>\u00a0in late April to <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_29873033/bp-wins-severance-tax-deduction-colorado-supreme-court\">authorize</a>\u00a0some hefty tax deductions\u00a0for the oil and gas giant. Taxpayers are now on the hook for\u00a0up to $100 million in payments to BP and other companies this year \u2014 and since the ruling sets a precedent, they&#8217;ll take the hit in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>As a company extracting natural resources in Colorado, BP must pay a severance tax to the state. However, natural gas extractors <a href=\"http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/colorado/?app=00075&amp;view=full&amp;interface=1&amp;docinfo=off&amp;searchtype=lt&amp;search=C.R.S.+39-29-102\">are allowed</a> to deduct costs\u00a0they can attribute to\u00a0&#8220;transportation, manufacturing, and processing.&#8221; In the case, originally filed in 2005, BP <a href=\"https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Court_Probation/Supreme_Court/Opinions/2013/13SC996.pdf\">argued</a> that foregone dollars that the company &#8220;could have earned had they invested in other ventures rather than in building transportation and processing facilities&#8221; should count as these types of costs.</p>\n<p>In other words, BP alleged that\u00a0the money they theoretically could have earned, had they spent it elsewhere, represented a deductible cost to the company.\u00a0And the Colorado Supreme Court agreed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is absolutely a subsidy,&#8221; said Jessica Goad, communications director at Conservation Colorado. But\u00a0Colorado is by no means alone in offering breaks to oil and gas companies. The United States <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/this-map-shows-which-countries-are-squandering-the-most-money-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">spends</a> some $20 billion in national fossil fuel production subsidies annually.</p>\n<p>Colorado already has the <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2014A/commsumm.nsf/b4a3962433b52fa787256e5f00670a71/6e505a47c1f2abad87257cc3004f788e/$FILE/140423%20AttachC.pdf\">lowest</a> effective severance tax in the West. Under state law, oil and gas companies are able to count\u00a0property taxes against\u00a0severance tax payments.</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch effort to disallow this kind of deduction under state law, Colorado House Democrats introduced a <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2016A/csl.nsf/fsbillcont3/4E2C33F4F0AD57DF87257FAE0063F251?Open&amp;file=1468_01.pdf\">bill</a> on Monday \u2014 but it <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2016/05/10/bill-to-reduce-tax-exemptions-for-oil-and-gas.html\">died</a> a procedural death on Tuesday night.

But while many environmentalists support the tax, critics say it\u00a0unfairly disadvantages the poor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yesonaaforthebay.com/moreinfo/file/SFBRA_AA_Text_SCC.pdf\">Measure AA</a> would impose a property tax of $12 a year on homeowners to address\u00a0forthcoming problems associated with climate change. The fund &#8212; which would raise an estimated half billion over the next 20 years &#8212; would be used to restore tidal marshes to\u00a0help mitigate flooding from rising sea levels.</p>\n<p>And the threat is significant. Eighty\u00a0percent of tidal marshes in the area have already been lost to development, <a href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/05/09/measure-aa-asks-bay-area-residents-to-help-protect-against-sea-level-rise/\">reports KQED</a>.\u00a0Scientists predict that the sea level could rise as much as\u00a04.5 feet\u00a0by 210o, which stands to wreak havoc on the low-lying areas of\u00a0San Francisco. One study estimated there&#8217;s\u00a0$62 billion worth of property at risk from climate change in Bay Area.</p>\n<p>This includes property owned by some very wealthy businesses in the area, like Facebook, whose new\u00a0Menlo Park headquarters is directly on\u00a0San Francisco Bay. And that&#8217;s what critics are taking issue with: The tax, the first of it&#8217;s kind, hits\u00a0everyone at the same level instead of tying the tax to\u00a0property values.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Whether it is a struggling farm worker family in a very modest bungalow in Gilroy, or the Apple campus there in Silicon Valley [the tax is the same],&#8221; Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, a group that lobbies against property taxes, told KQED. &#8220;So obviously there are equity issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite critics&#8217; concerns, the measure, which will also help protect wildlife and reduce pollution in the area, has been <a href=\"http://www.yesonaaforthebay.com/endorsements\">endorsed</a> by environmental groups like the Sierra Club, the\u00a0Environmental Defense Fund, the\u00a0Nature Conservancy.</p>\n<p>Regardless, it has a high bar to pass: The measure requires approval\u00a0by two-thirds of voters, who\u00a0will cast their ballots\u00a0June 7th.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/cities/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Cities</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/living/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Living</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/news/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">News</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331384&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://grist.org/cities/the-bay-area-could-get-a-whole-new-kind-of-climate-tax/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/rtr4ia61.jpg?w=170\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/rtr4ia61.jpg?w=170\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">golden gate</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>We\u2019re wiping out one-fifth of Earth\u2019s plant species</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/science/were-wiping-out-one-fifth-of-earths-plant-species/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 19:26:33 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Damian Carrington]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Article]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate & Energy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Living]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331414</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A new report highlights the threats to food security and medicine supplies but also reveals 2,000 new species are discovered each year.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331414&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/deforestation-c-shutterstock.jpg?w=1600&amp;h=900&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-grist-super size-grist-super wp-post-image\" alt=\"deforestation in action\" /></p> <p><em>This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/10/one-in-five-of-worlds-plant-species-at-risk-of-extinction\">story</a> was originally published by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us/environment\">Guardian</a>\u00a0and is reproduced here as part of the <a href=\"http://climatedesk.org/\">Climate Desk</a> collaboration.</em></p>\n<p>One in five of the world\u2019s plant species is threatened with extinction, according to the first global assessment of flora, putting supplies of food and medicines at risk.</p>\n<p>But the report also found that 2,000 new species of plant are discovered every year, raising hopes of new sources of food that are resilient to disease and climate change. New finds in 2015 included a giant insect-eating plant first spotted on Facebook and a 100-tonne tree hidden in an African forest.</p>\n<p>The State of the World\u2019s Plants report, by experts at the <a href=\"http://www.kew.org/\">Royal Botanic Gardens Kew</a>, reveals that there are currently 390,000 species of known plants, with more than 30,000 used by people. However, more than 5,000 species have invaded foreign countries and are causing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/06/amazon-and-ebay-hosting-ads-for-banned-invasive-species\">billions of dollars of damage</a> every year.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlants are absolutely fundamental to humankind,\u201d said Professor Kathy Willis, director of science at Kew, who led the new report. \u201cPlants provide us with everything &#8212;\u00a0food, fuel, medicines, timber, and they are incredibly important for our climate regulation. Without plants we would not be here. We are facing some devastating realities if we do not take stock and reexamine our priorities and efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p>The report is the first of what will be an annual benchmark analysis to set out what is known &#8212;\u00a0and not known &#8212;\u00a0about plants and highlight critical issues and how they can be tackled. \u201cI am reasonably optimistic,\u201d said Willis. \u201cOnce you know [about a problem], you can do something about it. The biggest problem is not knowing.\u201d</p>\n<p>The biggest factors threatening plant species with extinction are the destruction of habitats for farming (31\u00a0percent) &#8212;\u00a0such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/26/worlds-largest-palm-oil-trader-criticised-progress-deforestation-wilmar\">palm oil production</a> and cattle ranching,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/27/amazon-deforestation-report-brazil-paris-climate-talks\">deforestation for timber</a> (21\u00a0percent), and construction of buildings and infrastructure (13\u00a0percent).</p>\n<p>Climate change is currently a smaller factor &#8212;\u00a04\u00a0percent &#8212; but is likely to grow. \u201cI suspect we won\u2019t actually see the full impact until 30 years down the line as it takes so long for plants, especially trees, to produce their offspring,\u201d said Willis. One important <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/28/climate-change-bad-expensive-coffee-ipcc\">crop that is already suffering is coffee</a>, as rising temperatures make the beans impossible to grow and increase diseases in key countries such as Ethiopia.</p>\n<p>But the rate of new discoveries is a positive development, Willis said. \u201cI find that really encouraging and exciting. We are still finding new species of trees, new species of food: Five new species of onion were found last year, for example.\u201d Scientists at Kew alone identify 200-300 new species a year.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are huge areas of the world where we just don\u2019t know what is growing there,\u201d said Willis. \u201cThey may hold the key to the future of food. Genetic diversity in our foods is becoming poorer and poorer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Many important crops have been bred over thousands of years to produce high yields, but have lost genes that help fight pests and cope with changes in climate. Bananas, sorghum, and aubergines (eggplants) are among those with very little genetic diversity, making them highly vulnerable to new threats. Finding wild relatives of such crops means new, more robust varieties can be bred.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, with the global challenges [of] population size, land-use change, plant diseases and pests, there is an increasing urgency to find and conserve crop wild relatives,\u201d said the report. \u201cHaving access to this large and diverse genetic pool is essential if we are to furnish crops with the valuable traits that enable resilience to climate change, pests, and diseases, and ultimately underpin global food security.\u201d</p>\n<p>Among the 2,000 new plants discovered in 2015 was an insect-eating sundew (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosera_magnifica\"><em>Drosera magnifica</em></a>) which grows to 1.5 meters, far bigger than most sundews. It is known to grow only on a mountain in Minas Gerais, Brazil, and was first discovered on Facebook, when a sundew specialist was reviewing photos taken years earlier by an orchid hunter.</p>\n<p>Another new discovery was a 45-meter tree, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12225-015-9579-4\"><em>Gilbertiodendron maximum</em></a>, weighing more than 100 tonnes, which is known only in the rainforest in Gabon and is critically endangered. Five new custard apples and ylang-ylang relatives were also found along with a new species of sweet potato.</p>\n<p>The importance of plants for the development of new medicines was revealed in the report, which found that 57\u00a0percent\u00a0of the 31,000 species with known uses were those from which drugs were derived. More than 5,500 are human foods, while there are 2,500 poisons, and 1,400 with \u201csocial uses,\u201d such as tobacco and cannabis.</p>\n<p>However, when plants are transplanted into alien environments they can cause\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/20/alien-plants-spreading-across-the-world-causing-billions-in-damage-says-study\">great damage and become invasive</a>. \u201cThe costs of invasive species have been estimated at nearly 5\u00a0percent\u00a0of the world economy and their impact on the U.K. economy alone is approximately \u00a31.7 billion ($2.46 billion) every year,\u201d said the report.</p>\n<p>The highly invasive Japanese knotweed (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopia_japonica\"><em>Reynoutria japonica</em></a>), introduced as an ornamental plant to Britain in the mid-19th century, costs the nation more than \u00a3165 million ($239 million) a year to control. Like many invasive species, it is difficult to eradicate because it can survive even when cut back. \u201cThey are quite happy to survive underground and then sprout out the moment you turn your back,\u201d said Willis.</p>\n<p>The illegal trade in threatened plants is also a problem, the report found. At Heathrow, one of the world\u2019s busiest airports, officers made at least one seizure every day on average, with 42\u00a0percent\u00a0of the finds being orchids.</p>\n<p>Although plants are the foundation of most life on Earth, Willis said they were easy to take for granted: \u201cThey are not cute &#8230; and we teach [children about] plants in a really boring way.\u201d</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Climate &amp; Energy</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/living/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Living</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/science/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Science</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331414&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/deforestation-c-shutterstock.jpg?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/deforestation-c-shutterstock.jpg?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">deforestation</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Ethiopian farmers made a desert bloom again</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/food/ethiopian-farmers-made-a-desert-bloom-again/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 19:11:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nathanael Johnson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Article]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Living]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[climate adaptation]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[drought]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ethiopia]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[farm]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331411</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Ethiopian farmers innovate to fight drought -- and win big.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331411&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"1600\" height=\"899\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/debre-berhan1.jpg?w=1600&amp;h=899&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-grist-super size-grist-super wp-post-image\" alt=\"Debre Berhan1\" /></p> <p>Ethiopia is in the middle of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/02/ethiopia-famine-drought-land-restoration\">worst drought in 50 years</a>. It\u2019s the sort of shock to the system we are likely to see more of with climate change. But Ethiopia is also home to a successful experiment to make the land more resilient to drought. If we are going to adapt to our changing world, it\u2019s experiments like these that will show us the way.</p>\n<p>In the steep fields of Ethiopia\u2019s highlands, when rain falls on the parched, overworked land it runs downhill, carrying soil with it. Farmers commonly lose 130 tons of soil per hectare a year, comparable to the worst erosion documented on U.S. farms in recent history. Then, because the water has all rushed downhill, instead of seeping underground, wells go dry. Without water, crops wither, and that exposes bare soil to further erosion.</p>\n<p>This cycle turned a watershed in Adisghe County, Ethiopia, into a near desert, prompting the government to consider moving the farmers. Instead, they decided to try to rescue the land. With the help of an international project called Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (Africa RISING), they began building dams, terraces, and recharge ponds. They planted trees on hilltops and planted cover crops on degraded areas.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_331422\" style=\"width: 670px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/check-dams.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-331422\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/check-dams.jpg?w=660&#038;h=371\" alt=\"CIAT researcher Tesfaye Tesfamichael demonstrating the installation of check dams to prevent soil loss on the slopes. \" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"caption\">CIAT researcher Tesfaye Tesfamichael demonstrating the installation of check dams to prevent soil loss on the slopes.<br /></span><span class=\"credit\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ciat/22664716288/in/album-72157660568184619/\" target=\"_blank\">Georgina Smith / CIAT</a></span></p></div>\n<p>All of these methods had the same goal: Slow down the water. So, for instance, the farmers built check dams across gullies to stop the headlong flow, catch the eroding earth, and create a pool that would percolate into the ground.</p>\n<p>The results were astounding. As you can see in this video (shot\u00a0by Henry Tenenbaum and produced by Georgina Smith at the <a href=\"https://ciat.cgiar.org/\">International Center for Tropical Agriculture</a>), farmers and researchers have transformed dust bowls into productive green valleys.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='630' height='385' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/1HHYVYdlS10?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>Instead of leaving their homes, the farmers are staying put. As one local official put it, what was once a desert is now a forest. Thanks to increased water reliability, agricultural training, and precise use of fertilizer (synthetic and manure) farmers have doubled their production since the project started.</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t easy. Lulseged Desta, a soil scientist and landscape ecologist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture working with Africa RISING, told me that farmers must set aside up to two months a year for building dams and planting trees. What\u2019s the value of all that work? When organizers calculated how much it would have cost if they had hired laborers to do all that work, it added up to $2,200 for one project of about four square miles. That\u2019s a lot of money in Ethiopia, but it\u2019s certainly less than the cost of resettling families.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_331425\" style=\"width: 670px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-331425\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/leafy-matter.jpg?w=660&#038;h=371\" alt=\"Community member shows how returning leafy matter to the soil improves soil health \" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"caption\">Community member shows how returning leafy matter to the soil improves soil health<br /></span><span class=\"credit\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ciat/22690853299/in/album-72157660568184619/\" target=\"_blank\">Georgina Smith / CIAT</a></span></p></div>\n<p>This project was never meant as a silver bullet to solve the drought. The lowlands are still suffering. But it is part of the larger solution: This sort of transformation, writ large, can cushion climate crises. It helps to have these farmers at home producing food rather than facing migration. And, Desta said, these kinds of soil restoration efforts are now spreading around the country.</p>\n<p>Climate change hits poorest places the hardest. One reason is that they simply can\u2019t afford a lot of common-sense environmental protections. This Ethiopian test case shows us that, with a little investment and a lot of hard work, the most vulnerable places can become dramatically more resilient.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-change/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Climate Change</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/food/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Food</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/living/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Living</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331411&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/debre-berhan1.jpg?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/debre-berhan1.jpg?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Debre Berhan1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/check-dams.jpg?w=660\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">CIAT researcher Tesfaye Tesfamichael demonstrating the installation of check dams to prevent soil loss on the slopes. </media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/leafy-matter.jpg?w=660\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Community member shows how returning leafy matter to the soil improves soil health </media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>There\u2019s worrying volcano news.

Then again, if you\u2019re more afraid of climate change than natural disasters, massive volcanic explosions might actually sound like\u00a0a good thing, right? After all, a huge plume of ash could block sunlight and lower global temperatures.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what\u2019s up in volcano\u00a0news: Over the past two months, Mount St. Helens in Washington state, located a scant 174 miles from this author&#8217;s house, has been experiencing an &#8220;earthquake swarm.&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/earthquake-swarm-detected-beneath-mt-st-helens/265554630\">More than 130</a> small quakes have rumbled beneath the mountain, indicating that magma is on the move. But while this sounds terrifying, it&#8217;s actually nothing to worry about, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which wrote on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/USGSVolcanoes/posts/1261580570537168\">Facebook</a> that &#8220;there are no signs of an imminent eruption.&#8221; Whew.</p>\n<p>But what about Yellowstone? Yellowstone National Park is located on top of a supervolcano, and scientists <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/12/131218-yellowstone-supervolcano-eruption-magma-reservoir/\">discovered</a> a few years ago that the massive magma reservoir beneath it is two and a half times larger than previously believed, measuring 55 miles across. An eruption there could be 2,000 times larger than the blast at St. Helens in 1980 that killed 57 people, and, <a href=\"http://www.techinsider.io/supervolcano-wipe-yellow-stone-park-us-2016-4\">Tech Insider</a> reports, such an event\u00a0could cover much of the Midwest in ash, wipe out food and water supplies, and render vast swaths of land uninhabitable for at least a decade.</p>\n<p>Scientists have long thought that Yellowstone wasn&#8217;t due to erupt for at least another 10,000 years. However, a recently posted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL5vG8uRYe8\">YouTube video</a> alleging to show unusual seismic activity at the park has had some people speculating that eruption is imminent. It also, naturally, has inspired <a href=\"http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/39518/20160510/yellowstone-caldera-supervolcano-under-national-park-erupt-2016.htm\">quite</a> <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/667730/yellowstone-volcano-ufo-alien-youtube\">a</a> <a href=\"http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/21694/20160506/deadliest-supervolcano-underneath-yellowstone-national-park-might-erupt-this-2016.htm\">few</a> <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/662369/yellowstone-volcano-erupt-video-supervolcano\">headlines</a>\u00a0that might have you stockpiling food and water.</p>\n<p>But pause a moment before you head for the hills. I asked Bill Steele of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network if I should add the Yellowstone supervolcano to my (lengthy) list of anxieties. He said, quite simply, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then he laughed.</p>\n<p>The recent &#8220;unusual&#8221; seismic activity at Yellowstone isn&#8217;t actually unusual, Steele told me. &#8220;Yes, there are earthquakes there and it is a volcanic hotspot, but this is normal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As for Mount St. Helen&#8217;s, Steele said that even if it blew today, it just wouldn&#8217;t be that big a deal. The major eruption in 1980 let off all the mountain&#8217;s gas, and so, at worst, the next time St. Helen&#8217;s blows, it&#8217;ll be mostly steam.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s just pretend for a moment that Steele is totally wrong and both Yellowstone and St. Helen&#8217;s go today &#8212; and go big. Is it possible that large volcanic eruptions could actually be good for the environment? After all, one thing that definitely is happening right now is global climate change, so wouldn&#8217;t it be good to have an ashy reprieve from soaring temperatures, helping us keep the ice caps intact at least a little while longer?</p>\n<p>Yes, Steele tells me, if a volcano threw enough material into the stratosphere, it would cool the planet for a while. In fact, big eruptions have led to ice ages in the past. On the other hand, volcanic emissions include\u00a0carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and other greenhouse gases, which worsen climate change (though volcanos are a <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/what-do-volcanic-eruptions-mean-for-the-climate\">minuscule</a> source of warming gases compared to fossil fuel burning by humans). So a big eruption would be kind of a mixed bag for the climate.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the planet will be alright if and when both volcanos blow. &#8220;The Earth can handle volcanos,&#8221; Steele says. &#8220;It&#8217;s having a lot more difficulty with human activity.&#8221;</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/living/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Living</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/news/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">News</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331273&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://grist.org/article/theres-worrying-volcano-news-but-could-that-be-good-climate-news/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/volcano.jpg?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/volcano.jpg?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">volcano</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Oil-rich Alaska has surprising solar power potential</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/climate-energy/oil-rich-alaska-has-surprising-solar-power-potential/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://grist.org/climate-energy/oil-rich-alaska-has-surprising-solar-power-potential/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 21:56:01 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kate Yoder]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Article]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Business & Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate & Energy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331281</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Solar is cost-competitive with diesel in some remote Alaskan towns, a study found.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331281&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/solar-power-alaska.png?w=1600&amp;h=900&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-grist-super size-grist-super wp-post-image\" alt=\"Solar power Alaska\" /></p> <p>In oil-rich Alaska, where there&#8217;s little sunlight in\u00a0the winter, solar power isn&#8217;t an obvious option.</p>\n<p>But it is a promising one. A recent\u00a0<a href=\"http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/02/f29/Solar-Prospecting-AK-final.pdf\">study</a> from the\u00a0U.S. Department of Energy looked at the potential of\u00a0solar in 11 remote Alaskan villages and found that in many areas, it&#8217;s cost-competitive with diesel.</p>\n<p>Some\u00a0<a href=\"http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/02/f29/Solar-Prospecting-AK-final.pdf\">175 Alaskan communities</a>\u00a0rely almost exclusively on petroleum products like diesel for their energy needs &#8212; not exactly an optimal situation for energy security in\u00a0these remote towns, where transporting fuel comes at a high cost. People in these communities\u00a0<a href=\"http://grist.org/article/remote-alaskan-villages-move-from-diesel-to-wind-power/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">pay more for power</a> than anywhere else in the U.S.\u00a0That&#8217;s one big reason these communities could stand to diversify the energy eggs they&#8217;re putting in their resilience baskets.\u00a0Since solar energy isn&#8217;t practical during the winter, it&#8217;s important that these communities rely on a combination of energy sources (<a href=\"http://grist.org/article/remote-alaskan-villages-move-from-diesel-to-wind-power/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">wind is an option</a>\u00a0some towns have explored).</p>\n<p>Overall, thanks to\u00a0Alaska\u2019s sunny, radiant summers, the solarscape looks more promising than you might expect\u00a0given\u00a0those dreary winter months.

The headlines in particular went overboard. When Mathiesen\u00a0contacted lead author Simon Albert, he said\u00a0he&#8217;d have preferred &#8220;slightly more moderate titles that focus on sea-level rise being the driver rather than simply \u2018climate change.\u2019&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The major misunderstanding stems from the conflation of sea-level rise with climate change,&#8221;\u00a0writes Mathiesen. &#8220;As a scientifically robust and potentially destructive articulation of climate change, sea-level rise has become almost synonymous with the warming of the planet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The focus on climate change could be\u00a0confusing to readers, since sea-level rise has been a factor for the islands in\u00a0question because of a shift in trade winds.\u00a0Global warming is indeed a cause of rising seas. But for these islands, trade wind changes can also be attributed to natural climate cycles, and more research is needed to understand the relative contributions of each factor.</p>\n<p>The flub demonstrates the importance of accurate environmental reporting. When journalists\u00a0get it wrong, it&#8217;s only more fuel for science\u00a0deniers&#8217; favorite accusation that climate-change rhetoric\u00a0is alarmist.</p>\n<p>Climate Feedback, a climate journalism watchdog, recently\u00a0<a href=\"https://grist.org/news/scientists-are-fact-checking-climate-journalism-now/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">launched a crowdfunding campaign</a>\u00a0with the aim of beefing up their fact-checking capacity.

It\u00a0is a boggling problem\u00a0because &#8220;natural&#8221;\u00a0means something different to everyone. This isn\u2019t a job for a regulator, but for a philosopher or theologian, which is why Alan Levinovitz,\u00a0assistant professor of religion at James Madison University, is such a good resource.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/05/08/477057872/what-is-natural-food-a-riddle-wrapped-in-notions-of-good-and-evil\">NPR&#8217;s The Salt, Levinovitz writes</a>:\u00a0&#8220;The religiosity is apparent in the 4,863 public comments that have already been submitted to the FDA online. Natural and unnatural read like Manichean synonyms for good and evil. Some comments are <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA-2014-N-1207-2911\">explicitly</a> <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA-2014-N-1207-0310\">theological</a>: &#8216;Natural should be limited to those ingredients that have been created by God.&#8217; Others refer to violations of Mother <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/#!docketBrowser;rpp=25;po=0;s=%2522nature%252Bintended%2522;dct=PS;D=FDA-2014-N-1207\">Nature&#8217;s intentions</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When we\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s good for the earth, or good for our health,\u00a0we often seek out simple rules of thumb like <em>natural is good</em>. Seeking simplicity is\u00a0a great idea if the goal is to create a new religion in which nature replaces God. But it&#8217;s\u00a0a terrible idea if the goal is to create food systems designed with reason and science to nurture a sustainable and equitable society.</p>\n<p>The problem is that health and the environment are complex. They require all sorts of different solutions for different contexts. A top-down dictate to favor some definition of &#8220;natural&#8221; takes off the table solutions that work best for an individual, or for an individual piece of land.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/food/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Food</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331259&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://grist.org/article/the-feds-are-trying-to-figure-out-what-natural-food-is-dont-get-your-hopes-up/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>3</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kiwi.jpg?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kiwi.jpg?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Kiwi</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Stephen Colbert takes on Trump&#8217;s bizarre antics in coal country</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/news/stephen-colbert-takes-on-trumps-bizarre-antics-in-coal-country/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 16:41:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Katie Herzog]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Article]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate & Energy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331258</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The late-night host analyzes Trump\u2019s coal-mining dance, strange hand gestures, and outdated hairspray obsession.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331258&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvRU_Y2VWAg</p> <p>Donald Trump donned a hard hat on a campaign trip to West Virginia last week and mimicked working in the coal mines &#8212; a move that would have been humiliating if he possessed the ability to feel shame.

By spotlighting some 11,000 commitments cities, companies, regions, and investors have made since 2014, the U.N. hopes NAZCA\u00a0becomes an essential tool in motivating more entries in the future.</p>\n<p>But not everyone is so jazzed about it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://grist.org/grist-50/profile/angel-hsu/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Angel Hsu</a>, director of Yale\u2019s Data-Driven Environmental Solutions Group, spends a lot of time thinking about how to use data transparency to ease the troubles of fighting climate change. And as the registry currently stands, it\u2019s more laundry hamper than database.</p>\n<p>In April, Hsu and her colleagues published an <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/track-climate-pledges-of-cities-and-companies-1.19764\">article</a> in Nature laying out the risks of \u201cunevenly or idiosyncratically\u201d reporting climate action data. The gist: If there aren\u2019t clear reporting requirements for cities and companies, we have no way of knowing what\u2019s working, what isn\u2019t, and who\u2019s pulling their fair share.</p>\n<p>Take carbon prices, for example. The authors write that less than one-sixth of the carbon-pricing initiatives registered with NAZCA actually cite a specific carbon price. When companies do name a price, it can range from $0.01 to $357.37 per metric ton of carbon dioxide.</p>\n<p>The inconsistency matters because it implies a lack of accountability. Without a sense of what\u2019s reasonable, freeloading becomes that much easier. NAZCA does not require companies or cities to report or track implementation data, so there\u2019s no easy way of knowing whether or not they are actually following through on their commitments. Clear reporting standards can foster this kind of accountability, argue the researchers.</p>\n<p>Hsu also cites consumer pressures in developed countries as motivating companies like Shell and BP to take action. But for cities, there\u2019s no analogue of corporate social responsibility. City officials \u2014 and voters \u2014 just have to buy into climate action.</p>\n<p>Selling that climate action can be easier said than done. In <a href=\"http://www.c40.org/researches/unlocking-climate-action-in-megacities\">an analysis</a> released last Thursday, C40 Cities \u2014 a coalition targeting urban climate action \u2014 details the barriers cities face when attempting to combat a changing climate. The group cites a lack of city-country coordination, a failure to make a convincing case for climate action, and, importantly, an inability to secure funding for green projects as among the hurdles facing efficient and effective climate action. For instance, write the authors, \u201conly 1 in 5 C40 cities are able to borrow from the state, and only 1 in 4 to issue municipal bonds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cracking this nut is important because cities are well-positioned to do things that national governments can\u2019t. \u201cSub-national governments have more flexibility to experiment with potentially risky policy tools,\u201d write Hsu and colleagues.</p>\n<p>Cities are a \u201cliving laboratory for sustainable prosperity,\u201d Samuel Adams, director of the U.S. climate initiative at the World Resources Institute, told press last week. The lab could just use a bit more rigor.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/cities/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Cities</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Climate &amp; Energy</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/news/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">News</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=330573&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://grist.org/cities/cities-and-companies-have-pledged-to-fight-climate-change-now-what/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/sun-city-los-angeles.jpg?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/sun-city-los-angeles.jpg?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">sun city los angeles</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Trump and his hairspray leave cloud of weird in coal country</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/politics/trump-and-his-hairspray-leave-cloud-of-weird-in-coal-country/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://grist.org/politics/trump-and-his-hairspray-leave-cloud-of-weird-in-coal-country/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 23:39:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Katie Herzog]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Article]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate & Energy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331140</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Watch the presumptive GOP nominee do a coal-mining dance.

If I win we&#8217;re going to bring those miners back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As the Gazette-Mail points out, this is quite a change of attitude toward the mining community. In 1990, Trump\u00a0told Playboy, &#8220;If I had been the son of a coal miner, I would have left the damn mines.\u00a0But most people don&#8217;t have the imagination \u2014 or whatever \u2014 to leave their mine. They don&#8217;t have it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Trump, naturally, blames the coal industry&#8217;s troubles on the EPA,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/grist.org/videos/10154017648544809/\">an agency he plans to\u00a0shut down</a>. But the <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/sucks-to-be-the-coal-industry-right-now/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">reality</a> is that coal is suffering because natural gas is beating it in the marketplace and demand from China is declining &#8212; trends a President Trump would be unlikely to reverse.</p>\n<p>The Charleston rally also included an off-the-wall,\u00a0off-the-script hairspray rant, detailed by<em>\u00a0</em><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/06/donald-trumps-got-hairspray-riff-hes-gonna-use/\">The Intercept</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cMy hair look okay?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. \u201cGot a little spray \u2014 give me a little spray.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re not allowed to use hairspray anymore because if affects the ozone.

But no, in the old days, you put the hairspray on, it was good. Today, you put the hairspray on, it\u2019s good for 12 minutes, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, \u2018Wait a minute \u2014 so if I take hairspray and if I spray it in my apartment, which is all sealed, you\u2019re telling me that affects the ozone layer?&#8217;\u201d \u201c\u2018Yes.&#8217;\u201d I say, no way, folks. No way!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way!\u201d he added to cheers. \u201cThat\u2019s like a lot of the rules and regulations you people have in the mines, right? It\u2019s the same kind of stuff.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bemoaning the ineffectiveness of modern-day hairspray\u00a0may seem like an odd way to relate to miners, but, hey, Trump&#8217;s shtick is\u00a0clearly working for him.</p>\n<p>After the rally,\u00a0Trump said the crowd in Charleston numbered 28,000. The fire marshal&#8217;s count, says\u00a0the Gazette-Mail, was 11,600.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Climate &amp; Energy</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/news/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">News</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/politics/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Politics</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331140&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://grist.org/politics/trump-and-his-hairspray-leave-cloud-of-weird-in-coal-country/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>3</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/rtx2d1hn.jpg?w=175\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/rtx2d1hn.jpg?w=175\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to supporters in Charleston, West Virginia</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Earth is warming at scary rates, and this GIF proves it</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-earth-is-warming-at-scary-rates-and-this-gif-proves-it/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-earth-is-warming-at-scary-rates-and-this-gif-proves-it/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 23:19:51 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrea Thompson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Article]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate & Energy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331178</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Watch the Earth's temperature spiral toward catastrophic warming.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331178&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"1060\" height=\"669\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/screen-shot-2016-05-09-at-4-18-05-pm.png?w=1060&amp;h=669&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-grist-super size-grist-super wp-post-image\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-05-09 at 4.18.05 PM\" /></p> <p>The steady rise of Earth\u2019s temperature as greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere and trap more and more heat is sending the planet spiraling closer to the point where warming\u2019s catastrophic consequences may be all but assured.</p>\n<p>That metaphoric spiral has become a literal one in a new graphic drawn up by <a href=\"http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/author/ed/\">Ed Hawkins</a>, a climate scientist at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom.

Another climate scientist, <a href=\"http://www.cicero.uio.no/en/employee/37/jan-s-fuglestvedt\">Jan Fuglestvedt</a> of the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, suggested the spiral presentation.</p>\n<p>The graphic displays monthly global temperature data from the U.K. Met Office and charts how each month compares to the average for the same period from 1850-1900, the same baselines used in the most recent report from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>.</p>\n<p>At first, the years vacillate inward and outward, showing that a clear warming signal had yet to emerge from the natural fluctuations that happen from year to year.

An even <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/climate-goal-surging-in-paris-19782\">more ambitious target of 1.5 degrees C</a> (3 degrees F) has increasingly become a topic of discussion, and is also visible on the graphic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/Mann/index.html\">Michael Mann</a>, a climate scientist at Penn State who created the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick_graph\">\u201chockey stick\u201d graph</a> of global temperature records going back hundreds of years, said that the spiral graphic was \u201can interesting and worthwhile approach to representing the data graphically.\u201d</p>\n<p>He said that using an earlier baseline period would have better captured all the warming that has occurred, as there was some small amount already in the late 19th century.</p>\n<p>Just how much temperatures have risen is clear in the first few months of data from 2016, its line clearly separated from 2015 &#8212;\u00a0which was the <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/2015-hottest-year-2016-could-surpass-19929\">hottest year on record</a>\u00a0&#8212; and edging in on the <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/world-flirts-with-1.5C-threshold-20260?utm_content=buffer318ec&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source\">1.5 degrees C mark</a>.</p>\n<p>Every month of 2016 so far has been the warmest such month on record; in fact, the past 11 months\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/march-continues-streak-exceptional-global-warmth-20258\">have all set records</a>, the longest such streak in the temperature data kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (Each agency that keeps such a temperature record handles the data slightly differently, which can lead to small differences in monthly and yearly values, though the overall trend is in broad agreement for all such agencies.)</p>\n<p>The record-setting temperatures of 2016 have seen a small push from an <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/el-nino-peaks-but-impacts-to-come-19900\">exceptionally strong El Ni\u00f1o</a>, but they are largely the result of the <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/global-warming-key-driver-record-heat-19734\">heat that has built up</a> in the atmosphere over decades of unabated greenhouse gas emissions &#8212;\u00a0as the spiral graphic makes clear.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurns out that this version [of temperature records] particularly appeals, maybe because it doesn&#8217;t require much interpretation,\u201d Hawkins said.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Climate &amp; Energy</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/science/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Science</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331178&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-earth-is-warming-at-scary-rates-and-this-gif-proves-it/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/screen-shot-2016-05-09-at-4-18-05-pm.png?w=179\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/screen-shot-2016-05-09-at-4-18-05-pm.png?w=179\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Screen Shot 2016-05-09 at 4.18.05 PM</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/resizedspiral.gif\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Monthly global temperatures from 1850-2016. </media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Don\u2019t worry about Clinton pandering to coal states</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/climate-energy/dont-worry-about-clinton-pandering-to-coal-states/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 21:22:48 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Adler]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate & Energy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=331164</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[She won\u2019t need them after the primaries.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331164&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/clinton-west-virginia-reuters-c.jpg?w=1600&amp;h=900&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-grist-super size-grist-super wp-post-image\" alt=\"clinton-west-virginia-reuters-c\" /></p> <p>With the West Virginia and Kentucky primaries approaching, Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail in the heart of coal country, making <a href=\"http://grist.org/news/clinton-is-in-coal-country-and-its-getting-messy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">conciliatory overtures</a> toward coal miners. That might cause some climate activists to worry &#8212; but it shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Clinton\u2019s current effort to reach out to coal workers is aimed in part at defusing a controversy she kicked up in March when she <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/clinton-backtracks-on-coal-comments-after-coal-lovers-throw-a-fit/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">said</a>, \u201cwe\u2019re going to put a lot coal miners and a lot of coal companies out of business.\u201d That was a classic \u201cKinsley gaffe,\u201d named for the former New Republic editor who famously observed that a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth. If Clinton implements Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, as she has pledged to do, that would indeed accelerate the decline of the coal industry, which is already in trouble because of competition from natural gas. She just shouldn\u2019t have said that if she wanted to win over West Virginians and Kentuckians. (At the time, she was focused on winning the votes of climate hawks in more liberal states.) So now she\u2019s trying to reframe the issue.</p>\n<p>At a roundtable event last week, a teary-eyed, out-of-work coal miner confronted Clinton about that March comment: \u201cI just want to know how you can say that you\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs and then come here and tell us how you&#8217;re gonna be our friend,\u201d he said to her. Clinton <a href=\"http://grist.org/news/clinton-is-in-coal-country-and-its-getting-messy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">apologized</a> for her comment, and said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna do whatever I can to try to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no reason to think that the \u201chelp\u201d she mentioned would mean backing away from her climate agenda. Rather, she was likely referring to the <a href=\"http://static.politico.com/b8/90/cbbc9c59413089d87e8d6340f13d/clinton-releases-30-billion-strategy-to-help-coal-communities.pdf\">$30 billion plan</a> she unveiled in November to help coal communities transition to a clean energy economy.</p>\n<p>Even without her gaffe, Clinton wasn\u2019t doing resoundingly well in coal country. Her $30 billion plan was <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-aid-coal-communities-215789\">coolly received</a> by most coal community members when it was released. And with the flight of culturally conservative working-class whites in Appalachia to the Republican\u00a0Party, the Democratic primary voters in those states are increasingly liberal and pro-environment. That\u2019s why Sanders is expected to win West Virginia\u2019s Democratic primary on May 10, even while Clinton is expected to dominate in Kentucky on May 17.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, when the general election rolls around, Clinton won\u2019t need West Virginia and Kentucky to win &#8212; and she doesn\u2019t have much hope of winning them anyway, as they\u2019re now reliably red states in presidential contests. \u00a0It\u2019s only in the primaries that she has any cause to pander to them. By the time November rolls around, expect the concerns of coal miners to be as long-forgotten as those of Iowa farmers demanding support for corn-based ethanol.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Climate &amp; Energy</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/politics/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Politics</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331164&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/clinton-west-virginia-reuters-c.jpg?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/clinton-west-virginia-reuters-c.jpg?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">clinton-west-virginia-reuters-c</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The bison is back and better than ever</title>\n\t\t<link>http://grist.org/news/the-bison-is-back-and-better-than-ever-for-hed/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://grist.org/news/the-bison-is-back-and-better-than-ever-for-hed/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 20:01:17 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Melissa Cronin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Article]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Living]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://grist.org/?p=330000</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Our new national mammal has arrived and she's fabulous.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=330000&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/bison.jpg?w=1600&amp;h=900&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-grist-super size-grist-super wp-post-image\" alt=\"bison\" /></p> <p><i>Updated May\u00a09, 2016.

A few years later, Benjamin voted to overturn the $50 million verdict. It was such a perfect illustration of money&#8217;s corrupting influence that it inspired a John Grisham novel.</p>\n<p>Twelve years later, Blankenship has been sentenced to a year in prison for conspiring to violate mine safety regulations in the lead-up to a deadly explosion at one of his company&#8217;s mines in 2010. But the legacy of his political activism in the state &#8212; where he poured millions of dollars into conservative candidates and causes &#8212; has not ebbed. As Benjamin runs for reelection for the first time on Tuesday, following a 12-year term, funds from Blankenship allies are again flooding the race. But this time, this outside money is working against Benjamin, whom Blankenship&#8217;s allies deem insufficiently conservative. And Benjamin, without the financial backing of the business community, has been forced to turn to the very public financing system that was established as a response to his initial Blankenship-funded election.</p>\n<p>Benjamin&#8217;s 2004 race haunts this year&#8217;s contest. The state Supreme Court justice he challenged that year was a liberal stalwart named Warren McGraw. Blankenship\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/business/energy-environment/the-people-v-the-coal-baron.html\" target=\"_blank\">anticipated</a> he would lose his appeal unless he could change the makeup of the five-member court, so he spent about $3 million to elect McGraw&#8217;s Republican challenger, Benjamin, then a Charleston attorney. Much of that money was channeled through a nonprofit called And for the Sake of the Kids, which ran <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyb8xLTJ6SM\" target=\"_blank\">ads</a>\u00a0accusing McGraw of voting to set a child molester free. Blankenship also personally paid for ads supporting Benjamin, solicited money to help elect him, and sent out letters urging doctors to donate to Benjamin&#8217;s campaign on the grounds that he would help lower their malpractice premiums, according to <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Democracy/08caperton/081229.Caperton.Merits.Brief.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">court documents</a>.</p>\n<p>Benjamin won. When Blankenship&#8217;s case came before the state Supreme Court a few years later, Benjamin joined a 3-2 majority in support of Blankenship and Massey Energy, tossing out the $50 million judgment.</p>\n<p>That wasn&#8217;t the end of the case. Hugh Caperton, the man who had sued Massey, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Democracy/08caperton/081229.Caperton.Merits.Brief.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">appealed</a> to the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that Benjamin&#8217;s failure to recuse himself violated his right to a fair trial. The Supreme Court <a href=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/supreme-court-opinion-caperton-v-a-t-massey-coal-co/original.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">agreed</a> with Caperton and sent the case back to West Virginia to be reheard with Benjamin recused. (Blankenship won again on the basis that the case should have been filed in the state of Virginia, where it <a href=\"http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/virginia-judge-orders-new-damages-trial-caperton-massey-case/\" target=\"_blank\">is ongoing</a>.)</p>\n<p>Now, as he campaigns for reelection, Benjamin has found the dynamics that helped put him on the bench 12 years ago reversed. In 2004, Blankenship <a href=\"http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150926/GZ01/150929633/1101\" target=\"_blank\">carried the torch</a> for conservative causes in the state; today, Blankenship&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150926/GZ01/150929633/1101\" target=\"_blank\">former personal aides</a> continue his work to elect Republican legislators and pro-business justices. The difference is that Benjamin is no longer one of the candidates they favor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve turned on him viciously,&#8221; says Tim Bailey, a prominent plaintiff&#8217;s lawyer who often challenges the coal companies in the state.</p>\n<p>Operatives and allies once in Blankenship&#8217;s orbit are now actively working against Benjamin. Greg Thomas, whom Blankenship hired to run And for the Sake of the Kids, was until last year the executive director of a conservative legal advocacy group called West Virginia Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse (CALA). Last summer, CALA <a href=\"http://wvmetronews.com/2015/06/05/beth-walker-challenging-justice-benjamin/\" target=\"_blank\">began</a> <a href=\"http://www.wvcala.org/#!New-Research-Shows-Longstanding-Philosophical-Alliances-Among-State-Supreme-Court-Justices/c1duq/55b656ee0cf2d0bb156aeb27\" target=\"_blank\">raising</a> <a href=\"http://www.wvcala.org/#!West-Virginians-Should-Examine-Justice-Benjamins-Record-on-the-Supreme-Court/c1duq/5644f08f0cf2e1ca2795af3a\" target=\"_blank\">questions</a> about Benjamin&#8217;s record, highlighting <a href=\"http://www.wvcala.org/#!West-Virginians-Should-Examine-Justice-Benjamins-Record-on-the-Supreme-Court/c1duq/5644f08f0cf2e1ca2795af3a\" target=\"_blank\">cases</a> where Benjamin joined the more liberal justices in favor of personal-injury plaintiffs and against the interest of businesses. When a conservative lawyer named Beth Walker announced that she would challenge Benjamin last June, CALA <a href=\"http://wvmetronews.com/2015/06/05/beth-walker-challenging-justice-benjamin/\" target=\"_blank\">supported</a> her. (CALA&#8217;s current executive director, Roman Stauffer, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/romanstauffer\" target=\"_blank\">ran</a> Walker&#8217;s first Supreme Court campaign in 2008, which she narrowly lost.) Thomas, who is now a Republican consultant, told the <a href=\"http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150926/GZ01/150929633/1101\" target=\"_blank\">Charleston Gazette-Mail </a>last year that Blankenship spent heavily on the 2004 race in order to unseat McGraw &#8212; not because he particularly liked Benjamin.</p>\n<p>Walker was formerly a partner at one of the state&#8217;s top corporate law firms, Bowles Rice, which frequently represents coal companies and big business. Walker&#8217;s husband, Mike Walker, is a former executive at his family&#8217;s machinery company, which was a major contractor with coal companies. Walker Machinery <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?cycle=2004&amp;ein=201515424\" target=\"_blank\">donated</a>\u00a0$25,000 to And for the Sake of the Kids in 2004.</p>\n<p>Leading conservative groups have rallied around Walker, using <a href=\"http://wvpublic.org/post/outside-groups-outspend-5-wva-high-court-hopefuls\" target=\"_blank\">outside spending</a> to flood the airwaves in the final weeks before Tuesday&#8217;s election. As of May 5, the Republican State Leadership Committee, which is <a href=\"http://wvrecord.com/stories/510719866-outside-spending-in-state-supreme-court-race-tops-1-1-million\" target=\"_blank\">active</a> in judicial elections across the country, had <a href=\"https://cfrs.wvsos.com/#/ieec_list/8\" target=\"_blank\">spent</a> nearly $750,000 on Walker&#8217;s behalf and another $1.9 million against her opponents. The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce has spent almost $270,000 to back Walker.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Conservative business people, who are mostly Republicans, expected that after [Benjamin] got elected that he would rule their way all the time, and he hasn&#8217;t done that,&#8221; says Anthony Majestro, a personal-injury attorney who also represents Democrats running for office. &#8220;In a couple of high-profile cases, he voted, I think the business community would say, the wrong way. I think they saw a 12-year seat up for grabs and they handpicked somebody they think will vote their way all the time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One case cited by CALA, the conservative legal group, as evidence that Benjamin does not deserve reelection was a 2006 decision in which Benjamin joined the majority in ruling that an injured forklift operator in Virginia had the right to sue the product distributor in West Virginia. (The only dissenting justice was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/us/15court.html\" target=\"_blank\">photographed</a> vacationing with Blankenship in the French Riviera the same month the case was decided.) CALA also cites a case in which Benjamin joined a 3-2 majority in finding that individuals addicted to prescription drugs could sue the pharmacies that encouraged and profited from that addiction. CALA argued that the addicts shouldn&#8217;t be able to sue because they obtained or took the drugs illegally, and CALA&#8217;s executive director <a href=\"http://www.wvcala.org/#!West-Virginians-Should-Examine-Justice-Benjamins-Record-on-the-Supreme-Court/c1duq/5644f08f0cf2e1ca2795af3a\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> last November that Benjamin &#8220;decided to enable criminals and their attorneys to profit from illegal behavior.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;CALA and the people who support them care about stopping lawsuits,&#8221; says Majestro. &#8220;And so what their problem with Justice Benjamin was, is he didn&#8217;t go far enough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Without the support of the business community, Benjamin turned to the state&#8217;s public financing program to fund his reelection campaign &#8212; a program that was <a href=\"http://www.register-herald.com/opinion/columns/new-financing-system-gives-voters-ability-to-choose-truly-independent/article_b52f96e6-c520-5999-81ad-d899d4d3993a.html\" target=\"_blank\">born as a reaction</a>\u00a0to the conspicuous circumstances of his 2004 election. &#8220;From a personal standpoint,&#8221; Benjamin <a href=\"http://wvmetronews.com/2016/04/19/on-the-campaign-trail-justice-brent-benjamin-state-supreme-court-candidate/\">explained to the West Virginia radio network Metro News</a>, &#8220;I made the decision I could not judge cases and then know that my campaign committee was going to those very same people appearing in front of me, whether they be lawyers or clients of the lawyers, and asking for money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not easy to qualify for public financing in West Virginia. Benjamin <a href=\"http://www.sos.wv.gov/elections/campaignfinance/Pages/2016%20Supreme%20Court%20Campaign%20Public%20Financing.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">needed to raise</a> at least $35,000 from a minimum of 500 individual contributors from across the state. So an unlikely group helped secure Benjamin public financing: the trial attorneys and personal-injury lawyers who go up against the coal and business interests who backed Benjamin&#8217;s 2004 election.</p>\n<p>In 2004, Majestro helped McGraw raise money in his race against Benjamin. This year, he went to work for Benjamin. &#8220;I helped qualify him for public financing, which is among the ironies of this,&#8221; he says. Majestro says he helped Benjamin raise about $20,000 in a few days from fellow plaintiff&#8217;s attorneys.</p>\n<p>That the plaintiff&#8217;s bar decided to help out Benjamin is a testament to his record on the bench. &#8220;Most lawyers feel that he&#8217;s conservative but very fair,&#8221; says Bob Fitzsimmons, a well-known personal-injury lawyer in Wheeling. &#8220;A lot of the stuff that went on in that whole [2004] election gives an impression that I don&#8217;t necessarily ascribe to. I always have felt that he was a really good lawyer and a good person.&#8221; Bailey says that, considering who\u00a0backed Benjamin in 2004, he turned out to be &#8220;a heck of a lot more fair than we assumed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A group run by plaintiff&#8217;s lawyers, Just Courts for West Virginia Political Action Committee, has spent more than $200,000 on <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Buying_Time/STSUPCT_WV_JCWV_SPECIAL_CORPORATE_INTERESTS.mp4\" target=\"_blank\">an ad attacking Walker</a>. It invokes Blankenship&#8217;s role in the 2004 election, portraying Walker &#8212; not Benjamin &#8212; as beholden to Blankenship. &#8220;In 2004, Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship spent $3 million to elect a Supreme Court justice,&#8221; the narrator says, not mentioning that that justice was Benjamin. &#8220;Before her first campaign, Beth Walker met with Blankenship and hired his operative to run it. Now, Blankenship&#8217;s operatives and executives are funding Walker&#8217;s current campaign.&#8221; The ad concludes, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let special corporate interests buy Beth Walker a seat on our Supreme Court.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Benjamin and Walker aren&#8217;t the only candidates in the race. In 2014, Republicans took control of the West Virginia legislature for the first time in <a href=\"http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160108/wv-democrats-file-lawsuit-to-fill-vacant-senate-seat\" target=\"_blank\">more than 80 years</a> and moved quickly to pass several judicial reforms. Among them,\u00a0the legislature made judicial elections <a href=\"http://www.wvcala.org/#!Legislature-Approves-Nonpartisan-Election-of-Judges/c1duq/3D41CF2D-BABB-446A-9673-85CE7F05CC1D\" target=\"_blank\">nonpartisan</a>\u00a0&#8212;\u00a0a longtime goal for Republicans, since Democrats still outnumber them in party registration &#8212; and eliminated primaries, instead\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Bill_Text_HTML/2015_SESSIONS/RS/bills/HB2010%20SECOND%20SUB%20ENR.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">setting the election</a> on the day of the state&#8217;s primaries. The result is a system in which a candidate can win a 12-year Supreme Court term with a plurality of the vote in a low-turnout election.</p>\n<p>This year, there are five candidates in the race, allowing a candidate with high name recognition to come out on top over a divided field. On Jan. 30, the deadline for candidates to file, a surprise entrant upended the race: Darrell McGraw, the 79-year-old brother of former Justice Warren McGraw, whom Benjamin unseated in 2004. Darrell McGraw is well known throughout the state. He already served as a state Supreme Court justice from 1976 to 1988, and then spent 20 years as the Democratic state attorney general. The 2014 judicial reforms, intended to help elect conservative justices, may instead <a href=\"http://wvmetronews.com/2016/02/02/darrell-mcgraw-throws-a-curve-ball-at-filing-deadline/\" target=\"_blank\">hand the seat</a> to one of the state&#8217;s most prominent liberals.</p>\n<p>McGraw took the lead in an <a href=\"http://wvrecord.com/stories/510697699-poll-shows-mcgraw-leads-race-for-state-supreme-court\" target=\"_blank\">early poll</a>\u00a0&#8212;\u00a0there have not been any recent polls &#8212; and became the main target of attack ads from outside Republican groups. The presidential primary election could also pose a problem for Walker and Benjamin. The fact that Donald Trump is now the de facto Republican nominee could dampen GOP turnout, while the Democratic primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is still drawing Democrats to the polls. (Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andysere/status/728376276218568704?s=09\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly told supporters</a>\u00a0on Thursday to stay home from the primary now that he is the presumptive nominee.) The Supreme Court hopefuls are also near the bottom of the ballots, which may run longer than <a href=\"http://wvmetronews.com/2016/05/03/voter-patience-may-be-key-in-supreme-court-race/\" target=\"_blank\">20 pages</a> in some counties, and many voters may stop voting before they reach the end.</p>\n<p>The number of twists and turns in this contest have made the outcome anyone&#8217;s guess. In the 12 long years since Benjamin was elected, alliances have been turned upside down, nonpartisan campaigns have replaced partisan ones, and a public financing system has emerged. But in other ways, not a lot has changed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If Don Blankenship drops $3 million into an election years ago with a shadow group called And for the Sake of the Kids,&#8221; says Bailey, the plaintiff&#8217;s attorney, &#8220;and [now] the Chamber and the Republican Party drop in $2 million on a nonpartisan, one-shot primary type deal, you tell me what improvement we&#8217;ve had.&#8221;</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Article</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Climate &amp; Energy</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/news/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">News</a>, <a href=\"http://grist.org/politics/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feedgrist\">Politics</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=grist.org&#038;blog=5104299&#038;post=331137&#038;subd=grist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Buying_Time/STSUPCT_WV_JCWV_SPECIAL_CORPORATE_INTERESTS.mp4\" length=\"1028967\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Buying_Time/STSUPCT_WV_JCWV_SPECIAL_CORPORATE_INTERESTS.mp4\" length=\"1028967\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Buying_Time/STSUPCT_WV_JCWV_SPECIAL_CORPORATE_INTERESTS.mp4\" length=\"1028967\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Buying_Time/STSUPCT_WV_JCWV_SPECIAL_CORPORATE_INTERESTS.mp4\" length=\"1028967\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Buying_Time/STSUPCT_WV_JCWV_SPECIAL_CORPORATE_INTERESTS.mp4\" length=\"1028967\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/don-blankenship.png?w=200\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/don-blankenship.png?w=200\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Don Blankenship</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
