It&#8217;s about lunging through landscapes plucked from heavy metal album covers, punching things in the face until faces pop off, and old ways of thinking inflected by gonzo new filters.</p>\n<p>I had a chance to speak with <em>Doom</em> co-director Marty Stratton, who&#8217;s been with the studio since 1997, through games like <em>Quake III Arena</em>, <em>Doom 3</em> and <em>Rage</em>. Since review copies weren&#8217;t provided to press before launch (and therefore impressions and reviews are days off), here&#8217;s our late April interview with Stratton instead.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s old is new</h2>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to make something that had a familiarity to people who&#8217;ve played our past games,&#8221; says Stratton when asked to distill what makes <em>Doom,</em> <em>Doom</em>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pace and a feel of the weapons. These things tend to be classified in the arena shooter space, so things like no weapon reloading and bounce pads and map flow. But it&#8217;s a pretty broad definition, and what we tried to do was give people an experience that right off the bat they could have a ton of fun with, that they&#8217;d feel is familiar but also modern, that takes into account modern sensibilities about games.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s definitely things like the speed, the verticality, the double jumping, the way the weapons feel, the lack of reloading, even the placed health and armor and power-ups in the world. Those are all things that if you&#8217;ve played our past games, you&#8217;ll recognize, and then newer players, it feels different from a lot of the stuff that&#8217;s popular today.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>The canceled version of <em>Doom</em> &#8216;wouldn&#8217;t have been what people wanted&#8217;</h2>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t move on to <em>Doom 4</em> immediately after <em>Doom 3</em>,&#8221; says Stratton. &#8220;We spent some time working on <em>Rage</em>, started the <em>Quake Live</em> project and did a bunch of other things as well. Without going into extreme detail, the <em>Doom</em> that was being developed before we rebooted was actually a good game. There was a lot of effort put into it. It was very different, but it had a good design, there was a lot of really good artwork in it, and it was much more heavily story-based. It was a completely different take on <em>Doom</em>, is I guess the best way to say it, really from all facets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;From a presentation perspective, from a story perspective, the characters and demons&mdash;it was a totally different take on those. The setting was different, the mechanics were different. And when we were making the decision to change course, we sat down to play the game and there was a lot there, honestly. It was good. Like, if that project had been finished, it would have been a good game. But when you&#8217;d sit down and play it, you&#8217;d say &#8216;This is cool, but it just doesn&#8217;t resonate <em>Doom</em>.&#8217; It just wouldn&#8217;t have been what I think people wanted out of a <em>Doom</em> game.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/1sW7jp0u0PI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s the conundrum we were in. And there&#8217;s years of decisions and micro-decisions that get you to that place. But there are these points of reckoning that you hit, where you step back and evaluate, and you make big decisions. We were lucky to have Bethesda support our decision to reboot things and move in a different direction.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your very next step once you decide to reboot is, &#8216;Okay, then what is<em> Doom</em>? What do we expect? What do we think fans expect?&#8217; That was the process happening at the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013. And we landed pretty quickly on a design foundation for what to do moving forward. And it was just being inspired by those original <em>Doom</em> games. You take everything you&#8217;ve done up to that point, whether it&#8217;s technology or tools or artwork or process, and see what you can use moving forward. It was a pretty big change at the time.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s intentionally absurd</h2>\n<p>&#8220;Our guiding principles in making this <em>Doom</em> has been &#8216;keep it fun,&#8217; because we&#8217;ve really focused on making it a game,&#8221; says Stratton. &#8220;It plays like a game. It sounds stupid when I say that, when we&#8217;re making games, but it&#8217;s an action-combat game. So it&#8217;s all about the combat. If you&#8217;re into fast, improvisational action, shooting demons with big guns, it really hits that. It was one of those things that we got pretty good early, our core combat loop, the way the guns felt and our glory kill [super fast and violent melee attacks] mechanic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8216;The earlier iterations were a more serious take on <em>Doom</em>, which is perfectly fine. I was around for all of this, so I tend to look at that whole side of things, and we are where we are because of everything that&#8217;s led up to this point. You do your best and keep moving along. And as we&#8217;ve developed this in the vein of keep it fun, it&#8217;s also been a constant reminder that we take the development and our jobs and our responsibility to the game and brand very seriously, but in the creative side of it, we can&#8217;t take ourselves too seriously. It&#8217;s a crazy, outlandish, comic book, over-the-top brand. Even with the violence, we tend to say &#8216;How do we make it laugh out loud fun?&#8217; And we&#8217;ve tried to infuse that in every aspect of what we&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>There&#8217;s a &#8216;right&#8217; reaction to the violence</h2>\n<p>&#8220;We approach the violence or the blood and gore from a few different angles,&#8221; says Stratton. &#8220;We do have filters, as to how we evaluate it. Certainly being somewhat irreverent and violent is part of the DNA. How you deliver on that is up for grabs. Where we&#8217;ve chosen to really showcase it is in player feedback and player power, the power fantasy. When you shoot something, or when you punch something, or when you break something on a demon, there&#8217;s a ton of feedback.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And it goes into our animation system, our graphics system and the way our characters are rigged. Those are all specifically providing feedback to the player. Part of it&#8217;s the gameplay feedback, really selling the power of each weapon to the player. And when it comes to glory kills, you punch a guy&#8217;s head off, you break a leg, you slam them to the ground, and it&#8217;s that kind of crazy, over-the-top action movie feeling that you get to experience first-person. Violence-wise, it&#8217;s not for everybody, but I think it&#8217;s all in good fun.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We often reference things like <em>Evil Dead 2</em>, a horror film that&#8217;s almost laughable in its silliness. Everybody has their own sensibilities, but if somebody in our demographic is playing and when something violent happens or you do something violent to a demon, the reaction is laughing as much as anything, that&#8217;s the right reaction. If somebody turns their head and closes one eye and is squeamish about it, then it&#8217;s time to change something because we haven&#8217;t hit the mark. We talk about that a lot.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/RO90omga8D4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>\n<h2>Multiplayer has a touch of the <em>The Matrix</em></h2>\n<p>&#8220;All of the characters in multiplayer are human representations,&#8221; says Stratton to a question about human on human combat in multiplayer. (It&#8217;s all human-on-demon during the campaign.) &#8220;There&#8217;s actually a fiction, though it isn&#8217;t particularly prominent, in the multiplayer that the whole thing is a simulation. You&#8217;ll notice people spawning in and teleporting into the prematch lobby. It&#8217;s all fictionally tied into this simulation by this supercomputer that&#8217;s part of the single player campaign story.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s more than a graphics showcase</h2>\n<p>&#8220;Our presentation of the game has been much more about gameplay this time,&#8221; says Stratton. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve highlighted combat, talked about the demons and guns and speed, whereas past id Software games have tended to focus on graphics first and gameplay second. Back in the early days where we were pushing whatever the next graphics card was going to be, the leaps in engine technology were tremendous. I think people as they get in and play this new version of <em>Doom</em>, they&#8217;ll really appreciate what we&#8217;ve been able to do technically. But it&#8217;s really through the gameplay this time.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>The demons will come after you anywhere</h2>\n<p>&#8220;The way in which the demons move through the world has completely changed,&#8221; says Stratton. &#8220;We&#8217;ve advanced a system we started in <em>Rage</em>, where enemies can move through the world in realistic ways. So they can climb up all throughout the world, jump over things, climb over railings and get up to different areas. As acrobatic as the player is in our gameplay, and as much freedom of movement as you have, the A.I. needs to be able to move similarly and hunt you down and track you and chase you. It all needs to feel completely seamless. And I think it&#8217;s one of those things that just feels right when you play it.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>The solo campaign doesn&#8217;t play second fiddle to multiplayer</h2>\n<p>&#8220;We talked about the early period of the reboot, reestablishing what we thought <em>Doom</em> should be, and at the highest, highest level, before you even get into any of the tone and character and personality, what we established we wanted to make was an amazing campaign experience,&#8221; says Stratton. &#8220;Because that is what a lot of people remember, and bringing all of the elements that you would expect from a <em>Doom</em> game into a really compelling, fun, gamey campaign experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We absolutely wanted to create the multiplayer that people have now played the beta of, and again, a beta is just the tip of the iceberg of content. What everybody&#8217;s played in the beta is a super, super limited set of what&#8217;s in the final game. And then there&#8217;s the Snapmap component, which is a user-generated content tool and hub that harkens back to what players did with the original <em>Doom</em> in creating mods and wads and different ways to interact with the game and share your own creative ideas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was those three pillars that really formed our foundation. And the campaign has been a massive undertaking. By no means is anything an afterthought or a throw-in. Each has received a massive amount of development time and work. This has been id&#8217;s most ambitious project ever, and I really believe that any of these components by themselves could stand on their own against other games that only do one or the other.&#8221;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4325961&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/doom-baron-of-hell.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/doom-baron-of-hell.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">doom-baron-of-hell</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>This Is UPS&#8217; Latest Move to Fight Package Thieves</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/4328619/ups-follow-my-delivery/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:10:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[John Patrick Pullen]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[UPS]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4328619</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[It's like the Domino's Pizza Tracker for your Amazon deliveries<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4328619&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-4328619\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/4328619/ups-follow-my-delivery/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p class=\"p1\">UPS first asked &#8220;What can Brown do for you?&#8221; in 2002. Fourteen years (and one retired slogan) later, we finally have an answer to what was probably among the most requested features: Tell me where the heck my package is.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On Wednesday the company rolled out its &#8220;Follow My Delivery&rdquo; feature, a tool that lets customers track their bundles in real time on a map. Despite living in an age of Uber, Instacart, and even Domino&#8217;s Pizza Tracker, this is the first time a major U.S. package carrier has been able to show customers a package&#8217;s location en route. Progress!</p>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">Available to customers who sign up for UPS My Choice &mdash; a free service that provides package alerts, approximate delivery times, and online package signing &mdash; Follow My Delivery works by sending recipients an email the day their shipment is loaded onto a truck. Within that email, there&#8217;s a yellow &#8220;Follow My Delivery&#8221; button that opens a web page featuring a map of your local area.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The map shows both the package&#8217;s final destination and its current location. Though you will not see the truck&#8217;s exact route, the map does automatically refresh every two to three minutes so you can (hopefully) see your goodies inching closer to your door. Because recipients know exactly when packages are coming, the service could mean items stay on front porches and building hallways for less time, potentially cutting back on thefts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In my test this morning, the system worked almost flawlessly. In fact, the only problem was that it worked too well. Because I could see the truck arrive at my house on the map, I went out to greet my delivery person at my front walk. But instead of springing out of his truck as usual, he stayed inside organizing packages for a few minutes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When asked, my UPS delivery man said the new system has already improved his morning, with recipients like me ready to sign for packages with a smile. But I imagine his day was also made better because the system gave me enough advanced warning to put on normal clothes.

That&#8217;s the promise of virtual reality (VR) headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.</p>\n<p>As impressive as the technology already is, many believe it&#8217;s still in its early days. That&#8217;s because previous virtual reality-style efforts have flopped in the past. (Nintendo&#8217;s Virtual Boy comes to mind.) But the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more.</p>\n<p>Few have watched virtual reality evolve as closely as the companies building the hardware that powers it. TIME sat down with Frank Azor, general manager of the Dell-owned gaming PC manufacturer Alienware, and Nelson Gonzalez, Alienware&#8217;s cofounder and former CEO, to discuss what they have learned about VR and where they believe it&#8217;s headed. Below are the key highlights from our conversation.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://time.com/4277763/virtual-reality-buyers-guide/\">Virtual Reality Buyers Guide: Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive vs. Samsung Gear VR</a></p>\n<p><strong>Virtual reality will get more physical</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone who&#8217;s seen or tried the HTC Vive knows that some physical activity is involved. The Vive and its two controllers are equipped with sensors that allow players to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush.</p>\n<p>But what systems like the Vive or PlayStation VR currently lack is a sense of touch. Although it may look like you&#8217;re swinging a golf club, the device in your hand still feels like a video game controller. (The Oculus Rift doesn&#8217;t yet support any motion controllers, although the company plans to launch such devices later in 2016.) This is going to be one of the first areas in which virtual reality will improve, says Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The next evolution of VR would be where you participate physically in that VR world,&#8221; Gonzalez said. &#8220;And not just sitting down; if you&#8217;re a quarterback, you actually get to throw a football, and you can interface with the team. So that kind of stuff, it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Incorporating better touch controls will only be the start. Azor believes future VR devices could refine concepts first introduced <a href=\"http://time.com/4284807/virtual-reality-past-present-future/\">as far back as 1962 with the Sensorama</a>, which incorporated elements like wind and smells.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Headsets today are doing an excellent job at catering to your visual senses, and a little bit of audio as well,&#8221; said Azor, also Alienware&#8217;s fourth employee. &#8220;Well that&#8217;s just two of the senses . . . Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual piece begins to fade.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear exactly how &mdash; and if &mdash; technologies like those Azor described will ever take shape. But some companies are certainly trying. Leap Motion, a startup which launched a motion-sensing camera for computers in 2013, is now <a href=\"http://time.com/4226031/leap-motion-virtual-reality-orion-hands/\">building technology</a> for interacting with VR environments without a controller. Startup Thalmic Labs also makes <a href=\"http://time.com/4173507/myo-armband-review/\">an armband capable of controlling electronic devices</a> through gestures that works with the Rift.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://time.com/4272506/oculus-rift-review/\">Review: Oculus Rift is expensive, complicated, and totally wonderful</a></p>\n<p><strong>VR is an industry-wide effort</strong></p>\n<p>The Oculus Rift will likely be remembered as the first modern virtual reality headset. But it takes more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way, says Azor.</p>\n<p>Azor draws comparisons to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade. PCs became better equipped to deliver high-end gaming experiences as companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia developed more powerful chips and graphics processors. Games became more accessible on PCs as companies like Steam created platforms for easily buying and browsing content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone rallied around [the PC gaming] industry and now we have what we have today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;VR is the same type of thing; no one company can solve all of the problems.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>A wireless Rift or Vive won&#8217;t happen soon</strong></p>\n<p>There are two classes of virtual reality devices available today: cheaper, portable devices like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard, and beefier, expensive systems that offer more immersive experiences like the Rift and the Vive. The former plug into your smartphone to deliver VR that&#8217;s wireless and convenient, while the latter must be tethered to a PC to power their higher-end performance.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that we&#8217;ll see a high-performance device like the Rift go wireless anytime soon, mostly because wireless technology isn&#8217;t advancing at the same pace as VR hardware.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By the time we solve that, as an industry we&#8217;re going to want to give you version two of the product, which is going to become the new benchmark,&#8221; Azor said. &#8220;Wireless technology is on a different schedule, that&#8217;s where the issue comes in . . . The latest and greatest will be wired for a fair amount of time moving forward.&#8221;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4324598&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/gettyimages-511577070.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/gettyimages-511577070.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Samsung Electronics Co.

But this is a new one.</p>\n<p>Explaining that Facebook&rsquo;s users are the product, the Belgian police <a href=\"http://www.politie.be/fed/nl/nieuws/456-veilig-surfen-facebook-graaft-opnieuw-in-een-stukje-van-je-priveleven-met-de-nieuwe-reacties\">wrote</a> that the new reaction symbols help the social network to evaluate the effectiveness of its advertising.</p>\n<p>Limiting the number of reactions to six encourages people to express their emotions more frequently and thereby help Facebook&rsquo;s algorithms, the post read, adding that expressions of happiness tell Facebook when the time is ripe to show ads.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If it appears that you are in good spirits, Facebook will infer that you are receptive and will be able to sell advertising space by explaining to the advertisers that they are more likely to get a reaction from you,&rdquo; the police wrote, adding: &ldquo;One more reason therefore not to rush to click if you want to protect your privacy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Of course, one might argue that if you want to protect your privacy from Facebook, don&rsquo;t go on Facebook&mdash;the whole service is designed to analyze its users&rsquo; behavior, in order to figure out how to most effectively present advertising.

Larry Page, CEO of Google parent company Alphabet, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3173f19e-5fbc-11e4-8c27-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3HfAZgM8l\">argued</a> in 2014 that AI could bring economic benefits. &#8220;When we have computers that can do more and more jobs, it&#8217;s going to change how we think about work,&#8221; Page told <em>The Financial Times</em>. &#8220;There&#8217;s no way around that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other major industry figures warn that artificial intelligence could spin out of control. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, <a href=\"http://time.com/3541005/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\">once said</a> AI could pose the &#8220;biggest existential threat&#8221; to mankind. Philanthropist and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/31047780\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he&#8217;s &#8220;concerned&#8221; about the development of super intelligent machines.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p>Yet the technology continues to rapidly advance. Last month, Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/alpha-go\" target=\"_blank\">AlphaGo bot</a> became the first computer system to defeat a professional player of Go, a notoriously difficult game for AI to crack. Many experts considered the feat at least a decade away. Dag Kittlaus, an entrepreneur behind Siri, earlier this week demonstrated an even more sophisticated <a href=\"http://time.com/4323501/viv-siri-virtual-assistant/\">AI-powered assistant</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/meet/html/d.4.3.html\" target=\"_blank\">Murray Campbell</a>, a research scientist and senior manager with IBM, doesn&#8217;t think we have reason to worry about artificial intelligence in the near term. Campbell has been studying AI for decades since he was recruited to help develop Deep Blue in 1989, the IBM computer famous for defeating former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov. His current work in the company&#8217;s Cognitive Computing division examines artificially intelligent approaches to reasoning, planning, and decision making, and he regularly collaborates with the Watson team.</p>\n<p>Watson is famous for winning the television game show <em>Jeopardy!</em> in 2011. Today, IBM is hoping third party developers will use Watson&#8217;s cognitive system to analyze images, understand speech, crunch huge amounts of data and more. To pull that off, Campbell says, computers need to learn how to truly participate in conversations rather than just answer questions.</p>\n<p>TIME spoke with Campbell to learn what it will be like to have a real conversation with a computer, whether we should fear the idea of robots taking our jobs, and more. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>What is it going to be like to have a real conversation with a computer?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CAMPBELL:</strong> When was the last time somebody walked into your office and posed a perfectly well-formed unambiguous question that had all of the information in it required to give a perfectly formed, unambiguous answer? It just doesn&#8217;t happen in the real world. And so what happens is, there&#8217;s information exchanged. There are some things that are ambiguous or unclear, people will ask questions to try and clarify like &#8220;What did you mean by that?&#8221; or &#8220;You didn&#8217;t mention this,&#8221; etc.</p>\n<p>And if you have to script that all out in a dialogue system for a computer to do this, there are just so many ways that a conversation can go that you can never really do it. So you really have to have a learning approach, where a system learns to do this over time. So that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re focusing.</p>\n<p>It will begin to learn what you mean by certain things when you say them. And if it doesn&#8217;t understand what you mean it will ask, rather than just blindly doing what you say. So as we think about computers and people working more closely in the coming years, and we definitely believe that&#8217;s going to happen, the natural way of interacting is through dialogue.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"http://time.com/4278790/smart-people-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">What 7 of the World&rsquo;s Smartest People Think About Artificial Intelligence</a></p>\n<p><strong>How does a computer actually comprehend and answer a question?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CAMPBELL</strong>: When you ask the question, there are lots of [natural language processing] techniques and machine learning techniques that are applied to parse that question into its pieces, and then start coming up with hypotheses of what the answer could be by searching through a large corpus. It could be Wikipedia, it could be The New York <em>Times</em> archives, it could be anything.</p>\n<p>And as these hypotheses start to form, there&#8217;s evidence that will be found. Some in favor of one answer, some in favor of another answer. Some may be showing that a particular answer is bad. So all of this evidence accumulates and is brought together, again using a machine learning approach to decide which sources to trust the most, which evidence is the most convincing, and then come up with an answer. Not just an answer, however, but a confidence in that answer. So that if it&#8217;s not certain, you at least know that the answer you&#8217;re being provided is more or less a guess, whereas if it&#8217;s certain you can rely on it more.</p>\n<p><strong>I know you&#8217;ve also had some thoughts about the Go victory. Can you expand on that? How big a milestone for AI is this really?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CAMPBELL:</strong> So I think it is a big milestone. It was the last standing traditional board game that hadn&#8217;t been conquered by a computer. I think in a sense it&#8217;s now the end of an era. There won&#8217;t be as much research on board games going forward.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s more important to move towards messier kinds of problems that have factors like uncertainty involved. There&#8217;s some information that you don&#8217;t get to see, unlike in Go or in Chess, where everything you need to know is right there in front of you if you can just figure it out.</p>\n<p>But in the real world there&#8217;s a lot of information that you just don&#8217;t get to see and you still have to make a decision in spite of that fact. Or there may be some information that you see but isn&#8217;t reliable and you have to know how much to trust it. And in the real world you have to deal with language too.</p>\n<p><strong>So what&#8217;s an example of a real-world scenario that you&#8217;d like to see AI conquer?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CAMPBELL</strong>: I think most of the video games that people play provide really great test beds for exploring future AI technology. They require perception because there&#8217;s visual input, they often require some kind of language, and there are many possible actions that can be taken. So it&#8217;s a step towards the real world.</p>\n<p>But the real world is the real world. So you can imagine health care applications where a doctor is meeting with a patient, and is trying to decide what the appropriate course of action is. And there&#8217;s so much information out there in the world that might be relevant for this particular patient, but who has time to look through it all?</p>\n<p>So if you had a cognitive assistant that could go out and look through all the information, compare this patient with other patients and look at what course of treatment they had . . . and then provide that information to the physician, who&#8217;s really the decision maker, they could potentially make better decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"http://time.com/4109303/genius-cities/\" target=\"_blank\">The 100 Most Genius Places in America</a></p>\n<p><strong>Several influential figures in tech, like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern about AI. Do we have a real reason to fear AI, or is it being overblown?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CAMPBELL</strong>: I definitely think it&#8217;s overblown. I think it&#8217;s worthwhile to think about these research questions around AI and ethics, and AI and safety. But I think it&#8217;s going to be decades before this stuff is really going to be important. I think the big danger right now is, and one of IBM&#8217;s senior VPs has stated this publicly, is not following up on these technologies. Because the benefits are so huge, that if we don&#8217;t use AI technologies we&#8217;re going to be losing out on all of these beneficial effects in health care, in self-driving cars, in education.</p>\n<p><strong>People have also expressed concern about how AI will impact the job market in the future. IBM&#8217;s goal with Watson is to make jobs easier, not to eliminate them, but I still find it hard to believe that it won&#8217;t be an unintended side effect. If <a href=\"http://time.com/4251412/ibm-hilton-robot-hotel/\" target=\"_blank\">a robot like Connie</a> is helping answer questions in the hotel lobby, maybe the hotel could do with one fewer employee.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CAMPBELL</strong>: So there&#8217;s no doubt that there will be an effect on the job market, more in the mix of jobs and the kinds of jobs that are being done. If we each have our cognitive assistant that can help us be more efficient, then we can get more done and we don&#8217;t need as many people to do that particular job.</p>\n<p>But each time we create these cognitive assistants, we create new opportunities. That&rsquo;s the way it&#8217;s been in the past: new technologies take away some work, but create new opportunities. But I think these AI systems are going to have gaps. They&#8217;re going to have gaps in their knowledge for many years to come. And the practical way to fill those gaps is to partner them with humans who have a general intelligence and common sense reasoning so they can work together as a team to complement each other.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4281476&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-566035463.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-566035463.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, NEW YORK\u0096\u0096IBM has created a computer, called Watson, that will play against the b</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>NASA&#8217;s Ambitious Plan to Help Build The Next Concorde</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/4322280/nasa-quesst-concorde-supersonic-lockheed-martin/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 11:00:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Fitzpatrick]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[american genius]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Aviation]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[genius]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Innovation]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lockheed Martin]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NASA]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4322280</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[NASA and Lockheed Martin are working on a design that could fix the Concorde's biggest problem: It was just too loud<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4322280&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-4322280\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"http://time.com/4322280/nasa-quesst-concorde-supersonic-lockheed-martin/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>The Concorde, one of only two faster-than-sound aircraft to ever carry paying passengers, was one of mankind&#8217;s greatest aeronautic achievements. For those wealthy enough to afford the five-figure round trip ticket, a journey aboard Concorde was the closest they might get to flying on a rocket. The aircraft still holds the Guinness World Record for fastest commercial flight across the Atlantic, clocking in at a blistering 2 hours, 52 minutes, 59 seconds. (The passengers aboard the 1996 London-to-New York flight only learned of their involvement in aviation history upon landing.)</p>\n<p>Today, the Concorde that set that record is sitting idle on Manhattan&#8217;s Pier 86 beside the U.S.S. Intrepid, an aircraft carrier turned aviation museum. While the Concorde&#8217;s speed and on-board luxury captured the world&#8217;s imagination, it couldn&#8217;t outrun economics. <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">High maintenance costs and the drop in air travel after September 11, 2001 made flying the Concorde increasingly inefficient from a business perspective. (A fiery June 2000 crash that killed all 109 aboard didn&#8217;t help.) Eventually, the airlines that operated Concorde realized they could make more money by putting high-paying passengers in first class on subsonic jetliners. The Concorde last flew in November of 2003.</span><br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p>The Concorde faced problems beyond high costs. Any aircraft traveling faster than the speed of sound creates what&#8217;s aptly called a &#8220;sonic boom.&#8221; The house-ratting noise can be terrifying. When a military jet caused one such boom in New Jersey earlier this year, social media lit up with <a href=\"http://myfox8.com/2016/01/28/new-jersey-earthquake-caused-by-sonic-boom/\">reports</a> mistaking it for an earthquake or explosion. To avoid this problem, the Concorde was limited to subsonic speeds while flying over land. That meant it could only exercise its prime advantage over other aircraft while traveling on trans-oceanic routes.</p>\n<p>Now, NASA Commercial Supersonic Technology Project Manager Peter Coen thinks his team can solve the sonic boom, potentially opening the door for a new era of faster-than-sound commercial travel. NASA in February awarded a roughly $20 million contract to Lockheed Martin for preliminary work on a new supersonic aircraft that could travel quickly <em>and</em> quietly, the holy grail of supersonic aeronautics. TIME spoke with Coen, a 55-year-old Queens native and 33-year NASA veteran, about the project. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>TIME: Tell us about what your team is up to.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Coen:</strong> We like to say we&rsquo;re working on breaking down some of the barriers to successful commercial supersonic flight. Those include environmental barriers, like sonic booms, which we consider the new sound barrier. But we&#8217;re also working on takeoff and landing noise, high-altitude emissions . . . we&#8217;re working on reducing fuel burn by addressing propulsion and airframe technologies to make the operating economics better.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also working in conjunction with our airspace technology programs to make sure the airspace system is compatible with having fast airplanes trying to use their speed to the maximum extent they can, but also when it comes to takeoff and landing and terminal operations and integrating with the sub-sonic traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is it important to make a quieter supersonic jet?</strong></p>\n<p>In recent years we&rsquo;ve been focusing more on the sonic boom effort, because we feel that&rsquo;s the key barrier to opening the market. You can&rsquo;t fly supersonic over land, there may be a niche market you could fill with a business jet or something like the Concorde, but if you&rsquo;re going to really get airline-type operations with a supersonic aircraft, the airlines have to be able to use the aircraft on a variety of routes, and that includes overland routes.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Lockheed Martin working on exactly?</strong></p>\n<p>We have developed some technology which can change the nature of sonic booms quite significantly. We got to the point where we understand the physics &mdash; we&rsquo;ve developed configurations that, or at least computer studies of configurations, that incorporate that technology. The next step is really to demonstrate it in flight.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons for doing that. One is, you need to make sure that the technology works as advertised. We . . . really need to get flight data in the real atmosphere that helps us answer some questions about the interaction between the signal and the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>But the really big reason for building a demonstrator aircraft is to get community response data to this low-noise signal. The Federal Aviation Administration and the International Civil Aviation Organization have said they will consider developing a noise standard for supersonic overland flight. But they can&rsquo;t set a certification level without having community response data. So we did some conceptual studies where we asked, &#8220;is it feasible to do a relatively low-cost X-Plane type of program, where you would be able to get that answer?&#8221; And the answer from those studies came out &#8220;yes.&#8221; So we had a competition to do the preliminary design of the X-Plane, and that was awarded to Lockheed.</p>\n<p><strong>It has always amazed me that we, humanity, have had the capability of doing supersonic commercial travel for decades, but one of the things that killed it was noise, of all things.</strong></p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve heard sonic booms? It&rsquo;s funny, because we&rsquo;ve demonstrated them for lots of people. There are essentially two camps of people. One that says, &#8220;Oh, that&rsquo;s pretty cool,&#8221; and they&rsquo;re impressed by the technology. And the other camp goes, &#8220;Are you kidding me? We can&rsquo;t live with that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Personally I&rsquo;m a technologist, and I like aircraft. Concorde was a fascinating thing to me. But I truly believe that four or five or more Concorde booms per day in your backyard would really make your life pretty miserable. I don&rsquo;t think we as technologists can essentially decide that we&#8217;re going to affect people&rsquo;s lives in that way.</p>\n<p>If you look back . . . in the 50s, it was technology for technology&rsquo;s sake. In the 60s, the environmental movement was starting, it was in its infancy, but I really think the idea of sonic boom exposure was a driver that essentially, people began to say, &#8220;Wait a minute, just because it&rsquo;s a good technology for somebody, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a good technology for everybody.&#8221; I really think that moving forward, as technologists, we really need to look at things in a more holistic and global sense.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m really excited about what we&rsquo;ve done. Literally, I&rsquo;m trying to take &#8220;sonic boom&#8221; out of my vocabulary. It&rsquo;s not a boom that we can create from aircraft using this new shaping technology. It&rsquo;s really kind of a soft thump. We&rsquo;ve used &ldquo;heartbeat&rdquo; in some of our promotional material, and that may be a little bit too much, but I&rsquo;m quite sure in some circumstances this noise will go completely unnoticed if there&rsquo;s background noise.</p>\n<p><strong>Pretend I have little-to-no understanding of aerodynamics. How would you explain sonic booms to me?</strong></p>\n<p>Essentially, sound is a variation in pressure. An aircraft, when it&rsquo;s flying, is creating a pressure wave that moves out in front of it. I&rsquo;m not talking about the noise from the jets. I&rsquo;m just talking about, the air is flowing around the aircraft which causes a change in pressure, which, although you can&rsquo;t hear it, is a sound. And that sound travels out from the airplane in all directions at the speed of sound.</p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/boscof2p4_comp_tb12.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;h=534\" alt=\"Sonic Boom Shockwaves\" height=\"534\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >NASA</span><span class=\"caption\" >Shockwaves produced by a U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School T-38 banking at Mach 1.05.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re flying faster than sound, that pressure can&rsquo;t get out in front of the airplane. So all pressure changes related to air flowing around anything traveling at supersonic speeds occur as shockwaves, instantaneous pressure changes. So the Concorde, and any supersonic aircraft to date, if you look at the pressure distribution up close to the airplane, you would see all these shockwaves. One from the noise, one from the canopy or windshield, one from the wing, the engine nacelles, almost anything that sticks off the airplane creates a shockwave. They&rsquo;re all different strengths, and they occur at all different positions along the length of the airplane. Because they&rsquo;re different strengths, they tend to pile up on each other. They move at slightly different speeds . . . and so in a very short distance from the airplane, all those shockwaves have combined into just two. A strong shock at the nose of the pressure signal, and a strong shock at the tail of the pressure signal. And that travels in all directions, but we&rsquo;re most interested where it travels down and intersects the ground. And so when that pressure disturbance sweeps over you, you hear that sharp <em>bang bang</em> sound that most of us who have experienced a sonic boom are aware of.</p>\n<p>So the trick to taking the annoyance out of sonic booms is to take those shockwaves from coalescing and piling up into those two signals. If you can do that, each little shockwave now is minimized by the long distance that it travels. Instead of being a sharp pulse, it becomes kind of a rounded, more gradual pressure rise. So at the ground, instead of those two sharp rises, you get kind of a gradual pressure increase. If you drew it on a piece of paper, it would look more like a sine wave than an N-wave.</p>\n<p><strong>I imagine the challenge would be designing an airplane that accommodates those physics as well as what a paying passenger might expect from a commercial jet.</strong></p>\n<p>Precisely. The math was developed in the early 70s. In the 80s and 90s, we started being able to design practical airplane configurations that produced certain types of shaped waveforms on the ground. But in recent times . . . the computers improved, the analysis improved, we had some very innovative people.</p>\n<p>[Eventually] we broke free from the original math, which only allowed certain shapes of ground signals, to enable us to say, alright, what we want is the lowest noise signal that we can get. So we evolved our design target and the shape of the airplane at the same time. That does two things. It allows us to achieve a lower noise on the ground, and like you said it allows you to design an airplane that has a low-noise sonic boom, but you can also put a reasonable passenger cabin in it. And it does all the other things that an airplane needs to do well. It can have good takeoff and landing performance, it&rsquo;s efficient at cruise, it&rsquo;s stable, it&rsquo;s safe, it&rsquo;s structurally viable, and all of those things. That&rsquo;s really been the breakthrough. We&rsquo;ve been able to go from a nice mathematical solution, which you really couldn&rsquo;t design an airplane to meet, to the point where we&rsquo;ve got a good practical solution for low noise that we can meet with a practical airplane design.</p>\n<p><strong>So is this about the human desire to break barriers like the speed of sound, or is it more about practicality for you?</strong></p>\n<p>From a practical perspective, people want to spend less time in the air when they&rsquo;re traveling. They would love to get there faster. I really think that what most people are looking for is just reduced travel time. And whatever technology it takes to enable that for them.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s any particular fascination with going faster than sound in the broader sense. For those of us that are interested in the technology, one of the things is, why are we stuck? Why is this &mdash; it&rsquo;s not really a sound barrier anymore, but what is this barrier that has kept us at Mach .85 for the last 40 years, and what does it take to overcome that? But for most people it&rsquo;s, &#8220;Hey, I can get there twice as fast. That&rsquo;s a real time saver for me. That gives me a much better quality of life if I have to travel for a living, say.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ve read that you&#8217;re planning to have a working aircraft using this new design by 2020. Is that accurate?</strong></p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s correct, yes. Right now, Lockheed has been given a contract for preliminary design, which essentially sets the shape of the airplane. We&rsquo;ll do analysis and wind tunnel testing to verify the performance. We should be through with that by the middle of next year, 2017. Then after that we&rsquo;ll award another contract, if the program goes forward &mdash; there&rsquo;s always government funding to be considered. But we would award another contract, which would be the final design and the fabrication phase. I like to say we&rsquo;re looking forward to a first flight at the end of 2019, early 2020. And by 2021, we would be conducting our first community overflight testing.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4322280&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/16-022-supersoniccontract_0-copy.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/16-022-supersoniccontract_0-copy.jpg?quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">NASA Supersonic X-Plane</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/boscof2p4_comp_tb12.jpg?w=560\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Sonic Boom Shockwaves</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>",
