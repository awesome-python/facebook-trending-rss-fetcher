However, when it comes to electing a female president, the U.S. is not exceptional. Rather it is an exception to the rule.</p><aside id=\"signal-133463\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>The U.S. ranks 97th in global ranking of <a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">women in government</a>. Women hold only 19 percent of <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">elected government offices</a> here.</p><p>While many countries, including Germany, Denmark, and even Rwanda have embraced quotas for gender representation in government, the U.S. has <a href=\"http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3477&amp;context=wmlr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">shown no interest</a> in adopting such a policy.</p><p>This is startling because the U.S. is a leading advocate of women\u2019s rights around the world through its agencies <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/gender-equality-and-womens-empowerment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">for international development</a>.</p><p>Hillary Clinton has been a leading champion of international women\u2019s rights as the former First Lady, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State. In my new book, <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/products/9781138829749\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>The Global Hillary</i></a>, I suggest that as a leading advocate of \u201csmart power\u201d\u2014that is, combining America\u2019s \u2018hard\u2019 military power and \u2018soft\u2019 cultural power\u2014Clinton is arguably better suited to tackle America\u2019s global challenges than other candidates.</p><p>Voters seem to agree. It is <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/why-hillary-clinton-is-probably-going-to-win.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">likely</a> this is the election when female power finally reaches the White House, almost a century after women secured the right to vote in 1920 and 241 years after the country\u2019s founding.</p><p>If it happens, this historic achievement will advance America\u2019s image and improve the conditions of girls, women, and families at home and abroad.</p><h2>Political geography of women\u2019s leadership</h2><p>The political geography of women\u2019s power is uneven and disparate.</p><p>Of the 175 current heads of state around the world, 18\u2014or just over 10 percent\u2014<a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/pdf/publications/wmnmap15_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">are women</a>. Most female leaders globally have had short stints of fewer than four years.</p><p>In the U.K., India, and Israel women have held sway for long periods of time. Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, and Golda Meir were exceptional leaders not only for their staying power, but in part due to their family background and <a href=\"http://mqup.typepad.com/mcgill_queens_university_/2008/06/tough-women-who.html#more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">political history</a>. They were <a href=\"http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1515&amp;context=cmc_theses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">path breakers</a> though none openly claimed to be a feminist.</p><p>From 1966 to 1979, these women entered a male world of politics without challenging the system. Indira Gandhi\u2019s father was the founder of India\u2019s political dynasty. Golda Meir was one of the early architects of the state of Israel. Thatcher rose through England\u2019s parliamentary system with strong male sponsors in her party, even though she faced sexism and class bias as a \u201cgrocer\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>Since the 1980s, Europeans have led in terms of female heads of state, measured in both duration and frequency. In many instances, quotas have increased the participation of women in politics. In Iceland, President Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir held the country\u2019s highest office for the <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Vigdis-Finnbogadottir\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">longest</a> in the developed world\u201416 years beginning in 1980. In <a href=\"http://www.theglobalist.com/women-on-top-of-the-political-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Finland and Denmark</a>, women have been elected\u2014and re-elected\u2014prime minister.</p><p>German Chancellor Merkel, nicknamed <i>mutti,</i> or mother, has been in power for more than a decade. She has provided <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2016-04-06/strongwoman-europe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bold leadership</a> on the refugee crisis, and in many ways served as a role model for <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/07/hillary-clinton-angela-merkel-pantsuits_n_872788.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hillary Clinton and other women politicians</a> in the U.S. Earlier in her career, she was often compared with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-iron-frau-angela-merkel-1941814.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Margaret Thatcher</a> as the \u2018Iron Frau\u2019 or \u2018Iron Chancellor\u2019.</p><p>Democracy arrived only recently in the totalitarian states that until mid-1980s were behind the Iron Curtain. Yet, beginning in the 1990s and continuing to the present day, Eastern European states have elected female leaders to the highest office. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18328867\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kosovo elected Atifete Jahjaga</a> in 2011, and she served for five years. Croatia elected <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30765822\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic</a> in 2015. Poland elected <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewa_Kopacz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ewa Kopacz</a> in 2014. In 2013, Slovenia elected<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-government-idUSBREA4404U20140505\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Alenka Bratusek</a>.</p><p>In Africa, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2011/johnson_sirleaf-bio.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</a> in Liberia has been elected twice and other female leaders have been appointed to leadership roles in Senegal, Mauritius, Mali, and the Central African Republic.</p><p>In South Asia, women have historically come into power through dynastic succession, or in the aftermath of assassinations or coups d\u2019etat. Indira Gandhi, Benazir Bhutto and Sheikh Hasina are examples of Asian women who have led large democracies on the subcontinent. In Sri Lanka, <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Sirimavo-R-D-Bandaranaike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sirimavo Bandaranaik</a>, widow of Ceylon\u2019s former prime minister, served three terms.</p><p>But Asian systems are changing with the times, debunking the argument that Asian women have been elected exclusively due to dynastic rule and family inheritance. In <a href=\"http://time.com/4183442/china-taiwan-tsai-ing-wen-first-female-president/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen</a>, who has no political dynasty backing her, assumes office in May 2016. Women have also been democratically elected in Southeast Asia\u2014in South Korea, Thailand, and Myanmar.</p><p>In the Middle East, there have not been any women as heads of state, with the exception of Israel\u2019s Golda Meir. In fact, the Arab world <a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ranks lowest</a> in women\u2019s political participation.</p><h2>Can the U.S. elect a woman?</h2><p>In the Americas, women have been elected as heads of state in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Jamaica. Only Mexico and the U.S. lag behind. Both seem to have a deep-seated <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/products/9780765615701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">masculine political culture</a>.</p><p>One reason the U.S. hasn\u2019t embraced gender parity in the executive branch is due to the fear of the unknown or <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/products/9781848729926\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sexism</a>. Universally, women got the right to vote later than men and are still climbing the ladder of equality. Michael Genovese and Janie Steckenrider of Loyola Marymount University <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/products/9781848729926\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggest</a> these main reasons and others have kept women from reaching the White House.</p><p>It is also the case that the media amplifies gender bias. In her book \u201c<a href=\"http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/83ndt2rw9780252076916.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women for President: Media Bias in Nine Campaigns</a>,\u201d Erika Falk of John Hopkins University describes some of the common stereotypes about women running for president:</p><blockquote><p>A woman is not emotionally or physically capable of assuming the obligations of the most powerful office in the world \u2026 [W]e\u2019d be in mortal danger with a female president. \u2026 Definitely, a woman is too emotional. She acts on impulse. And often she\u2019s too sensitive to criticism.</p></blockquote><p>The gender bias may cut across other sectors of the economy, where only 18 percent of women occupied the corner office. Evidence from the private sector suggests that men are judged on potential, while women are judged <a href=\"http://www.catalyst.org/zing/how-new-discrimination-holding-women-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">on their performance</a>.</p><h2>Finally the right candidate?</h2><p>Even with all of these barriers, Clinton is favored to win this fall\u2019s general election.</p><p>Many political scientists <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/products/9781848729926\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">would agree</a> Clinton would not be inching closer to the Democratic nomination if, in addition to her singular achievements, she had not been groomed by the two previous Democrats who held the office she now aspires towards: her husband, Bill Clinton, and her former boss, Barack Obama.</p><p>If Hillary Clinton had not been <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/1992/05/hillary-clinton-first-lady-presidency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the key architect</a> of her husband\u2019s victories in 1992 and 1996, she would not possess the financial and political network to campaign and raise funds. Likewise, if she were not the Secretary of State in the Obama administration, she would not have the serious national security credentials that far exceed other candidates.</p><p>If the Democrats mobilize a diverse set of voters and turn out the vote in large numbers, the gender bias may finally recede. After all, progressive voters <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/179070/how-barack-obama-won-by-chuck-todd-and-sheldon-gawiser/9780307473660/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">turned out</a> against the race barrier in the previous two elections.</p><p>It has been more than a century since the Women\u2019s Liberty \u201cJustice Bell\u201d <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2010-08-26/news/24976217_1_voting-rights-suffrage-movement-liberty-bell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">passed through Pennsylvania</a>, marking the push for the Suffrage Amendment.</p><p>Americans have been leading the cause of gender equality in the twenty-first century. Can they match global rhetoric of women\u2019s empowerment and their domestic politics? Will the daughters of liberty finally have their day in the sun? In Hillary Rodham Clinton, they seem to have a viable candidate, and as good a chance as they\u2019ve had in the past 240 years.</p><p><img alt=\"The Conversation\" height=\"1\" src=\"//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/57259/count.gif\" width=\"1\"></p><p><i>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://theconversation.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Conversation</a>.

The country\u2019s political bent was decidedly more conservative than the Democratic Party had been through the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush presidencies, and by pulling the party to the right, Clinton was able to make it viable with a national electorate once again. </p><p>We\u2019ve seen the same basic logic<b> </b>applied to today\u2019s Republican Party since the early days of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency\u2014itself the culmination of two consecutive Democratic landslides. Obama himself <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/30/news/la-pn-obama-reelection-republican-fever-20130930\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hoped</a> that his reelection would, in his words, \u201cbreak the fever\u201d gripping the Republican Party. When it decidedly did not, he and countless others assumed that a third consecutive presidential election defeat would do what eight years out of power could not.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\">All the Republican stakeholders will have a story to tell that explains away their responsibility for a November defeat\u2014and they\u2019re rehearsing their lines already.</aside><p>In theory then, the fact that an obscene figure like Donald Trump was able to overrun the GOP, and is poised to lose the general election overwhelmingly, should herald a massive rethinking of what it means to be a Republican. Trump isn\u2019t the GOP equivalent of Michael Dukakis, personifying a party that has allowed the country to drift away from it. He is a symptom of a broken party\u2014an institution that chose as its standard-bearer a person it considered anathema until recently. </p><p>If the three-election theory is correct, it stands to reason that the post-Trump GOP will move to the center in some fashion or another between November of this year and 2020. Either it will adopt the non-profane elements of Trumpism (his economic populism, his restrictive thinking about immigration) and conform to him, or it will abandon different elements of orthodox Republicanism (supply-side economics, white identity politics) and move in a completely new direction. </p><p>It is the greatest hope of many Republican professionals, as well as many liberals who believe the GOP has become an extreme and dangerous force in American politics, that the party will reform in some way. Unfortunately, a number of forces\u2014some structural, some unique to Trump\u2019s rise\u2014will resist any change at all, leaving the Republican Party, perhaps for years to come, more broken and unwieldy than ever.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>In the wake of Trump, reuniting the GOP under a different paradigm would require at least some existing party factions to reckon with their own shortcomings, and then to adapt or die. </p><p>The foreign-policy hawks, religious conservatives, and business toadies of the conservative movement\u2014from whom the #NeverTrump movement draws most of its power\u2014would have to decide whether they could make peace with a Republican Party that wasn\u2019t fully under their spell. The Trumpist wing of the party would, at the very least, have to accept that Trump 1.0 was flawed, if not toxic. And whatever shape the new GOP were to take, the party\u2019s leaders would need to be willing to run it. </p><p>The problem is these same stakeholders will also be able to tell stories that disclaim responsibility for the defeat\u2014and they\u2019re rehearsing their lines already. </p><p>Trump has already proven himself a master of the buck-passing game. Earlier this year, when it seemed that Republicans might be able to wrest the nomination away from him on procedural grounds, Trump laid the foundation for delegitimizing the entire primary process as inherently corrupt; rather than admit defeat, he would argue that victory had been stolen from him. As the primary has given way to the general election, Trump has pre-spun two related defeat narratives, both of which gloss over or ignore his weakness as a general-election candidate. </p><p>First, he defines the intransigence of the #NeverTrump right as a threat to Republican victory, and the idea of a third-party candidacy as a suicide mission. <span>\u201cIf people want to be smart they should embrace this movement,\u201d </span><a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/21/donald-trump-warns-third-party-bid-by-gop-dissenters-would-destroy-country/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trump said back in March</a><span>. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to be smart, they should do what they\u2019re doing now and the Republicans will go down to a massive loss.\u201d</span></p><p>In defeat, Trump supporters, following his train of logic, will believe they were stabbed in the back by their own party. <span>They will also believe that they were stabbed in the front by corrupt Democrats.</span></p><p>In recent weeks, Trump has dubbed Clinton \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d\u2014an epithet optimized to convince his supporters that if he loses, it\u2019ll be because he was robbed. Here, other Republicans, including the anti-Trump wing (in spite of themselves), are abetting him. It is a foundational belief among conservatives of practically all stripes that Clinton deserves to be indicted by the Justice Department for storing state secrets on her personal email server, that an indictment may be coming, and that if it doesn\u2019t come it will be thanks to White House tampering. </p><p>Republicans have convinced themselves that <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/433757/hillary-clinton-still-weak-candidate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clinton is an unusually weak and eminently beatable candidate</a>\u2014and thus that if she wins, it will be thanks to some dirty trick. It is this presumed weakness that will tempt all factions of the right to rationalize away defeat, and to treat the Clinton presidency as essentially (or actually) illegitimate.</p><p>The excuses will fly like gifts from Oprah. </p><p>Whether they cotton to a conspiracy theory about the Obama DOJ or not, ideological conservatives will reprise their favorite maxims<b> </b>after the election: that conservatism can\u2019t fail, that it can only <i>be</i> failed, and that in this case it was failed by Trump. Ted Cruz will lead this particular rallying cry. \u201cAny time Republicans nominate a candidate for president who runs as a strong conservative, we win,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.michaelmedved.com/column/true-conservatives-win-every-time-is-alas-only-a-fantasy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cruz argued in July</a>, and throughout the campaign. \u201cWhen we nominate a moderate who doesn\u2019t run as a conservative, we lose.\u201d </p><p>The Republican establishment\u2014its current and aspiring leaders, its elder statesmen, and those who never warm to Trump but also never disavow him\u2014will meet the Texas senator halfway, writing off Trump as a fluke (a media creation, a celebrity), if not as an outright vindication of Cruz\u2019s wing of the party. \u201cI\u2019m convinced ... many in the press want him to be nominee,\u201d Marco Rubio <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rubio-trump-media_us_56d3079fe4b0871f60ebbbb5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a> of Trump shortly before dropping out of the race. \u201cI think they think it\u2019s going to be good for ratings and ... they know they have a lot of material to work with.\u201d</p><p>Thus the GOP of 2017 could be riven along multiple fault lines, unable to agree upon a single story about why Trump happened to them\u2014and parceling blame to one another, along with the Democrats, the media, and other outside forces, but never to themselves. We can expect Republicans to wallow in denial for some time after November. The question is how long. It was only because a consensus emerged among Democrats that the party had to change to win again that it moved right, however painfully, under Bill Clinton\u2019s leadership. Without a similar consensus, a whole new collective-action problem will overtake Republicans, and they will stagger into the next election more heedlessly than they staggered into this one. </p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133450/trump-crack-up-just-beginning-republican-civil-war</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133450</guid><category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ted Cruz]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Republican Party]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Brian Beutler]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:21:22 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/c79e10a87db84c9169f7900555db68cb7d918ebb.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Primary Concerns Episode 13: The Destruction of the Parties Is Nigh]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Spring primary season has, for all intents and purposes, given way to the fall election, skipping summer altogether.

And that\u2019s a threat to journalism.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><aside id=\"signal-133453\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Readers\nmay think they want an author with a personal connection to a topic\u2014and editors\nmay encourage that assumption\u2014but that kind of connection is, by definition,\nnot representative. (Nor are the topics that thinkpiece writers will have\npersonal connections to in the first place, which is<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">its own problem</span>.) While this is still less troubling\nthan that <i>other </i>genre, where\njournalists \u201creport\u201d on the <a href=\"/article/121097/feelings-journalism-feeds-jessica-williams-daily-show-tweets\">feelings</a> of\npeople other than themselves, it\u2019s still less than ideal.</p><p>As an\nexample, take Helaine Olen\u2019s recent <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_bills/2016/04/neal_gabler_s_atlantic_essay_is_part_of_an_old_aggravating_genre_the_sad.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Slate piece</a>, a snarky response to\njournalist Neal Gabler\u2019s <i>Atlantic</i> <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-shame/476415/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">story</a> about financial insecurity. Gabler\u2019s\narticle was about the 47 percent of Americans who\u2019d have trouble coming up with\n$400 in case of an emergency. The twist: He, big-shot writer, author of several\nbooks, and occasional television personality, was one of them. Gabler\u2019s point\nis that \u201cfinancial impotence\u201d (his term) is unspoken, and therefore invisible.</p><p>Olen\ndevotes her column to pointing out that Gabler is, in certain respects, quite\nprivileged. Which she admits <i>he </i>admits,\nbut when has that ever stopped a conversation between op-ed writers? But\nhighlighting privilege here is missing the point. Yes, on the surface, Gabler\ndoesn\u2019t seem like someone who\u2019d have money troubles. But evidently he does! That\nwas the point of his piece. Sometimes apparent advantages <i>don\u2019t </i>translate to financial stability; Gabler was discussing the\nunique and specific shame of that predicament. Olen\u2019s problem with Gabler\u2019s\npiece is at the level of his own failings\u2014not budgeting, but self-awareness. &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I\u2019d say\nit failed elsewhere. Specifically, in the flawed, ubiquitous journalistic template\nGabler chose to use: a fusion of societal analysis with reflections on a highly\npersonal and idiosyncratic situation. In other words, every article needs a\npersonal angle, and, conversely, every personal essay requires outside\nscientific or sociological qualification, as though an author\u2019s story is\nvaluable only if it\u2019s connected to something larger. The author\u2019s experiences\nlikely <i>won\u2019t </i>be a flawless example of\na broader social phenomenon\u2014both because these essay writers are likely more\nprivileged (culturally, if not financially) than the general population, and because\nexperience is subjective. &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>What\u2019s\nespecially frustrating about the privilege argument, in this case, is that the personal aspects of Gabler\u2019s story <i>do </i>illustrate a bigger picture, if not quite as Pew-level universal\nas he was aiming for. As Noah Berlatsky <a href=\"http://www.splicetoday.com/writing/pity-the-atlantic-feature-writer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pointed out</a> in his response, if Gabler\u2019s financial predicament is the\nsituation for <i>successful </i>writers,\nthat\u2019s a reminder of the dreadful state of the profession more generally. Status, however cherished,\ndoesn\u2019t pay bills. And likewise, tales of flawed, unlikeable characters don\u2019t usually hold up\nwell when channeled into an argument.</p><p>In\nGabler\u2019s piece, the differences between his situation and that of other\nstruggling Americans was simply so stark (the Hamptons house!) that he opened\nhimself up to this criticism. Moreover, bringing up his own case leads to a certain\ncontradiction: \u201cI don\u2019t ask for or expect any sympathy,\u201d he writes. \u201cI\nam responsible for my quagmire\u2014no one else.\u201d And yet the argument of his piece\nis precisely that the individual <i>shouldn\u2019t\n</i>be held responsible.</p><p>While\nfiction is ideal, a straightforward personal essay is still better than\nargument-driven introspection. More recently, Jason Guriel <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/i-dont-care-about-your-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">made the case</a> against confessional criticism\u2014that is, writing myopic\ncriticism, using the self as one\u2019s only text. \u201cA critic\u2019s desire to ensure that she comes off as messily\nhuman may come from an honest place, but it\u2019s hard to distinguish seemingly\nsincere moments of self-critique\u2026from rhetorical strategies designed to win\nreaders over,\u201d Guriel writes.&nbsp;As he notes, some of this is just a matter\nof taste. But there\u2019s something potentially dangerous about this sort of genre\ncrossing, when bigger political and economic points are at stake. The danger is\nthat we\u2019ll wind up having a narrow and unproductive conversation about an\nindividual\u2019s failings, rather than about the bigger systematic failures that\nnone of us, as individuals, can control.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133453/certain-thinkpieces</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133453</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Thinkpieces]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Phoebe Maltz Bovy]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/36c8c24ca56ea19c7a918428be53b1b48ffcba5f.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Should We Respond to Climate Change Like We Did to WWII?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>On <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/pearl-harbor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">December 7, 1941</a>,\nJapan\u2019s surprise attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor killed more\nthan 2,000 people and drew the country into World War II.

Green group <a href=\"http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Climate Mobilization</a>\npushed the idea <a href=\"http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/4_22_un_action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">during\na protest</a> at the April 22 signing of the Paris Agreement.

Its supporters don\u2019t entirely agree on the answers to key questions, such as: What will trigger this mobilization\u2014a catastrophic event or global alliance?\nWho will lead this global effort? When will the mobilization start? And perhaps\nthe greatest hurdle isn\u2019t logistical or technical, but psychological:\nconvincing enough people that climate change is a greater threat to our way of\nlife than even the Axis powers were.</span><span>&nbsp;<br></span></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p><span>Lester Brown, environmentalist and founder of the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.earth-policy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth Policy\nInstitute</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.worldwatch.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Worldwatch Institute</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>says he first introduced climate mobilization in the late 1960s.&nbsp;</span><span>His approach&nbsp;</span><span>is holistic\u2014and ambitious. \u201cMobilizing\nto save civilization means restructuring the economy, restoring its natural\nsystems, eradicating poverty, stabilizing population and climate, and, above\nall, restoring hope,\u201d he wrote&nbsp;</span><span>in&nbsp;</span><span>his 2008 book,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><i><a href=\"http://www.earth-policy.org/images/uploads/book_files/pb3book.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plan B 3.0</a></i><span>.</span></p><p>Brown proposes carbon and gas taxes, and pricing goods to account for their carbon and health costs. In his \u201cgreat mobilization,\u201d<b>&nbsp;</b>all electricity would come from renewable energy. Plant-based diets would replace meat-centric ones. According to Brown, this new economy would be much more\nlabor-intensive, employing droves of people in services like renewable energy\nand in compulsory youth and voluntary senior service corps. Brown also advises\nthe creation of a Department of Global Security, which would divert funds from the U.S. defense budget and offer development assistance to \u201cfailed states,\u201d (he cites countries such as Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Iraq) where climate change\u2019s impact on available natural resources will exacerbate<span>&nbsp;political instability.</span></p><p>This may sound far-fetched, but Brown believes we\u2019re at a tipping point for&nbsp;climate mobilization.&nbsp;<span>The economy is increasingly favoring renewables over fossil fuels, and grassroots campaigns like the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/article/121848/does-divestment-work\">Divestment Movement</a><span>&nbsp;are gaining steam.&nbsp;</span><span>Any number of circumstances could push the globe over the edge toward mobilization: severe droughts that create conflicts over water, or the accumulation of climate catastrophes from </span><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36264260\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">raging fires </a><span>to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/article/123182/managing-retreat-along-new-york-citys-coasts\">hurricanes</a><span>. When we cross over, Brown told me, \u201csuddenly everything starts to move. ... We\u2019re just going to be surprised at how fast this transition goes.\u201d</span></p><p>For environmentalists who\u2019ve seized upon Brown\u2019s idea, the transition has not been fast enough. They\u2019ve tailored their plans to include more explicit links to the war effort and&nbsp;a new sense of urgency.<b> </b>In 2009, Paul\nGilding, the&nbsp;former executive director of Greenpeace International and a member of the Climate Mobilization\u2019s advisory board, and&nbsp;Norwegian climate strategist Jorgen Randers&nbsp;published an article outlining \u201c<a href=\"http://theclimatepsychologist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/One-Degree-War-Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The One Degree War Plan</a>.\u201d The\nauthors set out a three-phase, 100-year proposal for healing the planet, beginning with a five-year \u201cClimate War.\u201d</p><p>In that first phase, a&nbsp;cadre of powerful countries\u2014the United States, China, and the European Union, for example\u2014would act first, forming a \u201cCoalition of the Cooling\u201d that would eventually pull the rest of the globe along with them. Governments would launch\nthe mobilization and reduce emissions by at least 50 percent. One thousand coal\nplants would close. A wind or solar plant would blossom in every town. Carbon would be buried deep in the soil through carbon sequestration. Rooftops and other slanting surfaces would be <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/blogs/lighten-up-energy-department-pushes-white-roofs-campaign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">painted white</a> to increase\nreflectivity and avoid heat absorption from the sun, which makes buildings and entire cities more energy-intensive to cool. Later, a\nClimate War Command would distribute funds, impose tariffs, and make sure\nglobal strategy is \u201charmonized.\u201d According to the paper, this Climate War should\nstart as early as 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Much has changed since the release of Brown\u2019s <i>Plan B 3.0. </i>Months after Gilding and Randers published \u201cThe One Degree War Plan,\u201d climate negotiators faced the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">crushing\ndefeat</a> of the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, where delegates\nleft without toothy commitments.

Last year\u2019s climate\nconference in Paris was a relative success, as an unprecedented number of\ncountries <a href=\"/article/125690/paris-climate-conference-deal-step-forward\">proposed\nplans</a> to cut their emissions.

But <a href=\"/minutes/125646/negotiators-still-behind-closed-doors-environmental-activists-already-pooh-poohing-climate-deal\">even\nbefore the ink dried</a>, environmentalists and some politicians condemned the\nwishy-washy language and limp goals. &nbsp;</p><p>Leaving the fate of the planet up to such diplomacy has \u201calways\nbeen a delusion\u2014one that I had, by the way,\u201d says Gilding.</p><p>\u201cIn that diplomatic world they have a notion of political\nrealism which is quite separate from physical reality,\u201d says Philip Sutton, a\nmember of <a href=\"http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Climate\nMobilization\u2019s</a> advisory board and a strategist for an Australian group <a href=\"http://www.green-innovations.asn.au/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">advocating a full\ntransition</a> to a sustainable economy. \u201cThe physical reality is now catching\nup with us.\u201d<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>To compare the fight against climate change to WWII may\nsound hyperbolic to some, but framing it in such stark, dramatic terms could\nhelp awaken the public to that \u201cphysical reality\u201d\u2014and appeal to Americans less\ninclined to worry about the environment.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not tree hugging\u2014it\u2019s muscular, it\u2019s patriotic,\u201d said\nMargaret Klein Salamon, director and co-founder of The Climate Mobilization. \u201cWe\u2019re\ncalling on America to lead the world and to be heroic and courageous like we\nonce were.\u201d<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>When Salamon began working on the group that would become\nthe Climate Mobilization, she was earning her PhD in <a href=\"http://theclimatepsychologist.com/leading-the-public-into-emergency-mode-a-new-strategy-for-the-climate-movement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">clinical psychology</a>. \u201cI\nview it as a psychological issue. What we need to do is achieve the mentality\nthat the United States achieved the day after the Pearl Harbor attacks,\u201d\nSalamon said. \u201cBefore that there had been just rampant denial and\nisolationism.\u201d<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Indeed, climate denial is still pervasive. Only 73\npercent of registered U.S. voters believe global warming is even occurring <a href=\"http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Politics-and-Global-Warming-Spring-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">according\nto the most recent survey</a>. Only 56 percent think climate change is caused mostly by human activity. It\u2019s going to take a catastrophe much worse than Hurricane\nKatrina or Sandy to alter public opinion to the degree necessary for a climate\nmobilization\u2014and even then, achieving that war mentality may be impossible.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good at fighting wars. \u2026 We fight wars on drugs and\nwars on poverty and wars on terrorism,\u201d says David Orr, a professor of\nenvironmental studies and politics at Oberlin College. \u201cThat becomes kind of the standard metaphor\nor analogy for action.\u201d But climate change is \u201cmore like solving a quadratic\nequation. We have to get a lot of things right.\u201d</p><p>There are other reasons the war analogy doesn\u2019t hold up. WWII\nmobilization was prompted by a sudden, immediate threat and was expected to\nhave a limited time span, whereas the threat of climate change has been\nincreasing for years and stretches in front of us forever. But perhaps the\nbiggest difference is that our enemies in WWII were clear and easy to demonize.\nThere is no Hitler or Mussolini of climate change, and those responsible for it\nare not foreign powers on distant shores. As Orr says, \u201cWe\u2019ve met the enemy and\nhe is us.\u201d</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133423/respond-climate-change-like-wwii</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133423</guid><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Climate]]></category><category><![CDATA[World War II]]></category><category><![CDATA[Global Warming]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bernie Sanders]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Emma Foehringer Merchant]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/520d86f70d17613e90453572718d95e302496ec3.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[<i>The Lobster</i>: Animal Magnetism, Or Else]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><i>The Lobster </i>features people like no one I\u2019ve ever met before, dialogue that could have been written for a \u201cHow To Simulate a Human Conversation\u201d handbook, and a moral that is both cynical and completely obvious to anyone who has ever walked outside of their house for longer than five minutes.

And that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the guiding principle of this whole universe. There is no dystopian militant dictator forcing this on the greater society, or some sort of crisis of population control. It simply is, and the people accept it like it\u2019s air, or death, or a banana.</p><p>Enter David (Colin Farrell), the only character in the film who gets a name. (Also in the credits: \u201cLimping Man,\u201d \u201cLisping Man,\u201d \u201cBiscuit Woman,\u201d and \u201cBob the Dog.\u201d) David\u2019s wife has just left him, so he dutifully, and wearily, reports to the hotel with his brother, who is now a dog. David, a lumpy sad-sack of a man, has essentially already given up on life but, through a series of unfortunate incidents, ends up an unlikely participant in a rebellion against the state, joining a group of woodland people led by Lea Seydoux who choose to be alone and live freely single. Just as soon as he\u2019s getting settled with them, he meets Short-Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz), and inconveniently falls in love.</p><p>This is all told in Lanthimos\u2019s deadpan style, an atmosphere so dry and arid that if Steven Wright showed up, you\u2019d think he was Jerry Lewis. Characters say exactly what they\u2019re thinking in the flattest way possible; Lanthimos writes like he is levied a fine for every adjective. It\u2019s a specific choice and, when it doesn\u2019t work, like in Lanthimos\u2019s <i>Alps, </i>you feel left out of a joke only the filmmaker understands. But here, the whole thing is like a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST-EWTVP32s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hygiene play</a> in which every interaction resembles ones we have every day, but stripped of any pretense or disguise. The people in the film are like us, just a little less so\u2014and a little more so. I fear I\u2019m not describing it quite right, so I\u2019ll just show you.</p><figure class=\"article-embed\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/f4dzGfKul8s?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></figure><p><span>This elevates the material into the realm of the fantastical while still keeping it grounded in our mundane reality, an impossible balancing act that Lanthimos somehow pulls off. For such a strange artist, Lanthimos has a lively, mischievous sense of humor, and there\u2019s a scene involving electronic music in the forest that is one of the funniest things I\u2019ve seen in months. But his general subject here is love, and our desperate, often undignified search for it. Lanthimos mocks our need for companionship\u2014which is really just a search for someone like us, or at least someone who can serve our individual needs\u2014by heightening their stakes: Our culture demands coupling up, in Lanthimos\u2019s view, which is just a few steps away from </span><i>actually</i><span> demanding it. Or you\u2019ll be turned into a </span><span class=\"st\">crustacean.</span></p><p><span class=\"st\">Somehow, unfathomably, Lanthimos turns this into a love story, which saves the sharp-elbowed comedy from curdling into something deeply unpleasant. David might not necessarily find love, but he finds someone who needs him as much as he needs them\u2014which, even if love doesn\u2019t actually exist, is a reasonable facsimile, one that ultimately serves the same purpose. Against all odds, <i>The Lobster </i>ends up becoming a little bit romantic, even hopeful, as embodied by Farrell\u2019s impotent, beaten-down, defeated, yet still somehow full-hearted performance. He makes you believe that, even in the demented universe of this film, there\u2019s still a chance for you. This movie doesn\u2019t have much new to say about love; its insights are far from blinding. But it does show us a new way to think about it. I smiled through the entire freaking thing. This movie is crazypants, but, man, it is my kind of crazy.</span></p><p><b>Grade: A-</b></p><p><i>Looking for more movie recommendations?

In the first\ncentury C.E., the Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria designed dolls that\ncould be used to act out miniature theatrical scenes. The original treatises he\nwrote about these <i>automata </i>were lost to history. But a group of Sicilian\nscholars discovered Arabic translations in the thirteenth century. Translating\ninto Latin, the monks coined a new term for automata that looked human: <i>andro\u00efdes,\n</i>from <i>andros</i>, the Greek word for \u201cman.\u201d</p><aside id=\"signal-133034\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Androids have always inspired mythmaking. In the thirteenth century,\nlegend spread that a Dominican bishop named Albertus Magnus had built an Iron\nMan to guard his chamber. It stood at the entrance, hearing the petitions of\nvisitors and either allowing them an audience or not, until one day, the\nbishop\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a young St. Thomas Aquinas, flew into a rage and smashed it\nto pieces. Some said that Aquinas had become convinced that the Iron Man was\ndemonic. Others maintained he was simply fed up with its interrupting his\nprayers.</p><p>In the late 1730s, an inventor named <a href=\"http://www.swarthmore.edu/Humanities/pschmid1/essays/pynchon/vaucanson.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jacques de Vaucanson</a> presented three\nautomata at the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in Paris: one that played the flute,\nanother that played the recorder, and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/16/extract.gabywood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">toy duck</a> that walked, ate, and\ndefecated. In 1774, Pierre and Henri-Louis Jaquet-Droz, father and son\ninventors from Switzerland, began touring with a harpsichord player they had\nbuilt to resemble a young girl. She shook her head and breathed as she played,\nto show how the music was affecting her. One of their main competitors was the\nGerman inventor David Roentgen, who constructed a dulcimer player modeled on\nMarie Antoinette and gave it to her as a gift.&nbsp;\n</p><p>These stories always seemed to raise the same question: What would it\ntake for a thing to go from being merely humanoid to actually human? The\naudiences who admired the toy musicians raved about their <i>sensibilit\u00e9</i>\u2014the\nway they seemed to be moved by their own performances. In the twentieth\ncentury, the criteria shifted. With the rise of computing and artificial intelligence\n(AI), scientists began to talk more about thinking, sentience, and self-consciousness.</p><p>The mathematician Alan Turing defined the most famous test of machine\nintelligence <a href=\"http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">in a paper</a> that he published in 1950. Imagine, he proposed, a\nhuman being text-chatting with a computer. Now imagine a third party, reading a\ntranscript of their conversation from a separate room. If the third person\ncannot tell human from computer, who can say that the machine is <i>not</i>\nthinking?</p><p>Engineers are still trying to program computers to pass the \u201cTuring\nTest.\u201d So far, no computer ever has. (The 2014 instance in which an artificial\nintelligence designed to resemble a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy passed the test\nis <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-did-a-computer-finally-pass-the-turing-test-20140610-column.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">widely disputed</a>.) But when it comes to representations of robots and AI in\npopular culture, another criterion rules. Audiences have long been less captivated\nby the prospect <br>\nof machine sentience than machine romance.</p><p>For centuries, there have been stories of men who <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2011/01/26/133213460/can-machines-fall-in-love\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">fall in love with\nandroids</a>. Over the past decade, the idea of creating <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/16/5216522/can-humans-love-computers-sex-robots-her-spike-jonze\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI you could love</a> has\nmoved from the realm of science fiction and into that of commerce and research.\nAs AIs get better at games like <a href=\"http://qz.com/502325/an-ai-computer-learned-how-to-beat-almost-anyone-at-chess-in-72-hours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chess</a> and <a href=\"http://qz.com/603313/googles-ai-just-cracked-the-game-that-supposedly-no-computer-could-beat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html?pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jeopardy</a>, investors have\npoured resources into the study and development of <a href=\"http://affect.media.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201caffective\u201d</a> or \u201cemotional\u201d\ncomputing: systems that recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human\nfeelings.</p><p>\u201cFeelings seem to be an inextricable part of genuine \u2018intelligence,\u2019\u201d\nsaid Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, which co-chairs with Elon Musk the\nnewly founded <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/12/elon-musks-billion-dollar-ai-plan-is-about-far-more-than-saving-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1 billion research group OpenAI</a>. The Turing Test is supposed to\ndetermine whether a machine can think, or seem to think. How would you test\nwhether a machine can process and simulate feelings so well that a human user\ncould develop real feelings for it? Well, how do you test whether you could\nlove anyone?</p><p>You flirt.</p><p>Flirting might seem trivial. It is in fact a highly exacting test of\nintelligence. Think of all the things that you have to do in order to flirt\nsuccessfully. Express certain desires via tone of voice and body language while\nhiding others. Project interest, but not too much interest. Correctly read the\nbody language of others, who are also strategically dissembling. Say\nappropriate things and respond appropriately to what is said.</p><p>Evolutionary science has shown that, for humans, flirting is a key <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299992\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">test\nof emotional and social intelligence</a>. It assesses exactly the capacities that AI researchers are trying to endow\nmachines with: the ability to generate feelings in others, and <a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/heres-why-one-day-you-will-probably-fall-love-robot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">to understand\ncontext and subtext</a>\u2014or the difference between what a person wants and what a\nperson says. </p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>For an artificial intelligence to flirt, one might imagine that a\nphysical form resembling our own would be important. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/14/science/for-man-and-beast-language-of-love-shares-many-traits.html?pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">first scientist</a> who seriously studied flirting in fact\nconcluded we do most of it with facial expressions and physical gestures.\nIran\u00e4us Eibl-Eibesfeldt, an ethologist, or animal behavior expert, at the Max\nPlanck Institute in Bavaria, began a cross-cultural investigation in the 1960s.\nFor over a decade, he gathered field notes of \u201ccourting\u201d couples in Samoa,\nBrazil, Paris, Sydney, and New York, surreptitiously photographing them as they\ntalked. He noticed that several behaviors seemed to hold constant across these\nvery different places. Both males and females would often place a hand, palm\nup, in their laps or on a table. They would shrug their shoulders and tilt\ntheir heads to show their necks. Try it sometime. Look at a stranger across a\nroom, tilt your head and smile, or toss your hair aside and see if she or he\nfails to respond.</p><p>The common thread among these behaviors was that they all telegraphed: <i>I\nam harmless. </i>Anthropologists and psychologists building on this work<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/14/science/for-man-and-beast-language-of-love-shares-many-traits.html?pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\ncreated more elaborate taxonomies </a>of \u201cnonverbal solicitation behaviors\u201d that\nhumans use to \u201cattract attention\u201d and to establish recognition with prospective\nmates. In 1985, Monica Moore of the University of Missouri <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309585900160\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">published an article</a>\nin the journal <i>Ethology and Sociobiology </i>cataloging 52 behaviors\nobserved in female subjects. They ranged from the \u201csmile\u201d to the \u201cglance\n(room-encompassing glance)\u201d to the \u201cglance (short, darting)\u201d to the \u201clip lick.\u201d\nThe goals of flirting that Eibl-Eibesfeldt and Moore described resemble the\ngoals of contemporary AI, which must draw human users in without becoming so\nhumanlike as to seem dangerous or uncanny. </p><p>David Hanson, the founder of Hanson Robotics, has spent his career trying\nto balance those demands. The mission of his company, <a href=\"https://hansonrobotics.wordpress.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hanson Robotics</a>, is \u201cto\nrealize the dream of friendly machines who truly live and love, and co-invent the\nfuture of life.\u201d Their specialty is skin. They are famous for Frubber, an\nelastic compound that Hanson patented in 2006. Frubber is flexible; it can be\nprogrammed to mimic the mechanisms of 60 different muscles in the human face\nand neck. Sheathed in Frubber from the neck up, Hanson androids smile and\nfrown; they raise their eyebrows quizzically and twitch. Hanson believes the\nkey to cultivating love between humans and intelligent robots will be these\nkinds of gestures\u2014or, as he puts it, \u201ctechnologically and physically embodied\npresence.\u201d</p><p>Hanson studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and spent several\nyears working at Disney Imagineering, before moving to the University of Texas\nfor his PhD in robotics. At a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/david_hanson_robots_that_relate_to_you?language=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2009 TED Talk</a>, he presented an android bust\nmodeled on Albert Einstein that demonstrated how his robots recognize and\nrespond to nonverbal emotional cues. When he frowned, so did the Einstein\nrobot. When he smiled, Einstein smiled back.</p><p>Hanson believes this kind of \u201cexpressive capability\u201d allows machines to\nelicit attention and affection from their users. He says robots that can\nperform such behaviors will attract and engage humans\u2014and the relationships\nthey form will in turn improve AI. \u201cWe have a natural bias toward humans and\nagents that can give humanlike social responses,\u201d he told me. \u201cBrain scans\nlight up when we look at faces. We have 100-million-plus years of evolved\nneural hardware that makes us desire anthropic character experience.\u201d If robots\ncan activate the neural pathways that the face does, humans will attribute\nemotions and intentions to them. </p><p>Hanson also believes enthusiastic tinkering with empathetic androids will\nfacilitate a breakthrough to artificial general intelligence, much as amateurs\nimproved early personal computers and helped build the internet. At least, this\nis his hope for his latest project: Sophia. </p><p>Hanson <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3045299/robots/meet-sophia-the-female-humanoid-robot-and-newest-sxsw-celebrity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">unveiled Sophia</a>, which he created using open-source software at\nSouth by Southwest in March. \u201cThe Chinese say she looks Chinese. The Ethiopians\nsay Ethiopian,\u201d Hanson said, referring to the teams of engineers he has working\nin Hong Kong and Addis Ababa, among other locales. In fact, he partially modeled\nSophia\u2019s appearance on his wife, Amanda, an American with a Southern lilt in\nher voice.</p><p>All summer and fall, Hanson and Sophia were on the road\u2014shooting a film\nin Hungary, presenting at conferences in Beijing, Budapest, and Berlin, and\nmeeting with prospective investors around the United States. But the engineer\nin charge of creating her personality, Stephan Bugaj, stayed at work in Los\nAngeles. I met Bugaj at the La Brea Tar Pits, where sculptures of woolly\nmammoths and saber-toothed wildcats stand at the edges of active bogs that\nstill stink and pop and leap. Bugaj and I took a stroll around the tar pits\nbefore settling at a caf\u00e9 next door, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\"><p>What would it take for<br>\na thing to go from<br>\nbeing merely humanoid\nto actually human?&nbsp;</p></aside><p>Bugaj spent several years at Pixar, where he worked on visual effects for\n<i>Ratatouille</i> and the<i> Cars</i> movies. He said creating an artificial\npersonality was very similar to creating a character for a script, and he cites\nas influences the screenwriting experts Syd Field, Robert McKee, and Blake\nSnyder. \u201cYou ask, \u2018What is her background? What is her fear, what are her\ngoals, her internal problems that she wants to overcome?\u2019\u200a\u201d Bugaj said that he creates \u201cenneagrams\u201d\u2014<a href=\"https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/about-the-enneagram-institute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ancient diagrams for modeling\npersonality </a>that made a New Age comeback in the 1970s\u2014for every robot he works\non. Then he attends to the tiny physical gestures in which personality becomes\nmanifest.</p><p>\u201cAt Hanson, we decompose emotions into micro-expressions and\nmicro-narratives. Little scenarios play out whenever you receive a stimulus. These are reactive models of emotional\nresponse,\u201d he told me.</p><p>He told me the first step in making robots \u201calluring\u201d is to make them\n\u201cnot alarming\u201d\u2014to overcome the feelings of unease, even horror and revulsion,\nthat realistic androids often trigger. And the key to <i>that</i> is\nprogramming robots to enact the right physical expressions. For example, they\nmust continually slightly move their bodies.</p><p>\u201cIf we were on a date, it would be weird if I stood completely still,\u201d\nBugaj said. He froze in place. \u201cBut it would also be weird if I just suddenly\nlurched at you!\u201d He did, <br>\nso quickly that I gasped and dropped the iced tea in my hand. The wind made my\nmostly empty cup skitter away. \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Eye movement is also crucial, he said. The eyes have to move a bit. \u201cIf I\nwere to stare right at you all through our conversation\u201d\u2014he started doing it\u2014\u201cthat\nwould be alarming. But it would also be rude if my eyes were constantly\nwandering away.\u201d He gazed at a person walking by, and then at a tree overhead.</p><p>Of course, to get from not alarming to alluring requires greater\nsophistication.</p><p>\u201cYou need the robot to be smiling and engaged, smiling and nodding, to be\nresponsive and reacting quickly. It\u2019s very alluring to follow up, and to take a\nspecific question and turn it around so that it becomes about the speaker. So, for\ninstance, if you ask a robot about her favorite book, she will say, \u2018My\nfavorite book is <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> Do <i>you</i> like\nscience fiction?\u2019 She takes your question and reflects it back.\u201d</p><p>I asked Bugaj if he thought people would fall in love with Sophia.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople fall in love with animals and shoes. A robot can\nprovide more relatability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? What does a human get out of that kind of relationship?\u201d</p><p>Bugaj reflected a moment. \u201cWhy are humans so fascinated by chimps and\ndolphins? We are, as a species, lonely.\u201d</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Most engineers working on AI do not focus on humanlike bodies. It is\neasier to make an AI both alluring and nonthreatening if it has no body at all.\nConsider the flirtatious chatbot. Conversational robots have been coming on to\nunsuspecting users in chat rooms and on dating apps for some time. In 2007, an\nAustralian security company, PC Tools, discovered that Russian developers <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-internet-idUSL1290432120071213\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">had\ncreated a script called CyberLover</a>. CyberLover bots could carry out automated\nconversations according to several different personality profiles, from the\n\u201cromantic lover\u201d to the \u201csexual predator.\u201d They could engage up to ten new partners in 30 minutes, briskly collecting personal data from each.</p><p>Recently, the study of flirting has increasingly focused on the <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/3/833.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">role of\nlanguage in human courtship</a>. Some say that even if we use our bodies and\ngestures to telegraph desire, possessing language is the key element that makes\nour species behave the way we do. In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299992\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a paper </a>published in <i>Evolutionary\nPsychology</i> in 2014, the ethologist Andrew Gersick and ecologist Robert\nKurzban suggested that human flirting may have evolved to be uniquely indirect <i>because</i>\nwe have language. \u201cLanguage makes all interactions potentially public,\u201d Gersick\nand Kurzban wrote. If a dragonfly bombs an air dance, the female he was trying to\nimpress has no way to tell all her dragonfly friends. But if you drop a lame\npickup line to a fellow human, there are social costs: You may lose access to\neveryone in your target\u2019s circle. Therefore, humans evolved \u201ca class of\ncourtship signaling that conveys the signaler\u2019s intentions and desirability to\nthe intended receiver while minimizing the costs that would accompany an overt\ncourtship attempt.\u201d</p><p>Neither males nor females of our species respond well to the verbal\nequivalent of a bellow in the face. We are equally likely to succeed with a\nprospect by saying \u201cWe should get a coffee sometime,\u201d as by stating, \u201cI am\nsexually interested in you. Are you sexually interested in me?\u201d Producing\nplausibly deniable signals does not directly demonstrate biological fitness the\nway that a bison bellow or dragonfly dance might. But it shows something else\nthat members of our species tend to value: social intelligence.</p><p>This kind of verbal indirectness is very difficult for AI, as you quickly\ndiscover if you try to joke around with Siri or Cortana. But chatbot\nprogrammers have tried. To understand how teaching a chatbot to flirt might\nwork, I spoke with Bruce and Sue Wilcox. The Wilcoxes, who run a company called\n<a href=\"http://brilligunderstanding.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brillig Understanding</a> in San Luis Obispo, California, have developed\nChatScript, an open-source program that lets other people build their own bots.\nTogether, the Wilcoxes have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34302338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">won the Loebner Prize</a>, an international competition\nfor conversational AIs, four times.</p><p>Bruce and Sue explained the primary goal that drives the design of their\nchatbots: to create AI capable of convincing someone she is being heard and\nunderstood. To do that, they must minimize failures, or interactions in which\nthe bot says something that clearly shows it doesn\u2019t comprehend what is being\nsaid. They also want opportunities for the bot to reveal personality<i>, </i>typically<i>\n</i>in the form of unexpected opinions or information that imply comprehension.\nA lot of the philosophy behind ChatScript comes from the ancient Chinese game\nof Go. </p><p>\u201cIn Go,\u201d Bruce told me, \u201cthere is this idea of <i>sente</i>, the right to\nplay first. Whoever has <i>sente</i> has control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Go, this is a power struggle,\u201d Sue clarified. \u201cBut a conversation is\nan exchange.\u201d</p><p>A conversational robot claims <i>sente</i> by introducing a \u201ctopic\u201d from\na database of statements that it has stored, all related to a variety of\nsubjects with which it is familiar. So, for instance, if you are chatting about\nmovies, the bot will have many possible responses ready about which ones it has\nseen, and liked or disliked, and why. It will also employ \u201cgambits\u201d\u2014statements\nor questions that direct conversation toward subjects with which the bot is\nfamiliar. Users respond well to \u201creflection.\u201d Or, as the Wilcoxes put it,\nresponders hand them back <i>sente</i>, the baton for directing the\nconversation:</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite book?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? </i>(pause) Do you like science\nfiction?\u201d </p><p>And, like Hanson, the Wilcoxes emphasize that users have a tendency to\nproject. </p><p>\u201cHumans have always had a strange relationship with AI,\u201d Bruce said.\n\u201cPeople always want to read more into the conversation than is there.\u201d </p><p>In 2012, at the behest of a British company that sells educational games\nfor children, the Wilcoxes released a bot, <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/talking-angela-programmer-talks-hoaxes-ai-mastery-q-a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talking Angela</a>, that a group of\nalarmed parents refused to believe was AI.

Most\nchatbots, however, quickly give themselves away. Programmed to respond to\nparticular triggers, they are hapless when it comes to grasping insinuation, context,\nand sentiment. Words change depending on when, where, and how we use them.\nContext constantly colors our speech with new connotations. Without the ability\nto process this kind of information, flirting goes nowhere. </p><p>The promise of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and other \u201cdeep learning\u201d\ncomputational machines <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160411005180/en/Deep-Learning-Emerging-Important-Enabling-Technology-Computer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">modeled on the human brain</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/22/10813984/google-deep-learning-udacity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google is developing</a>,\nis that they can move beyond the kinds of overt \u201ctriggers\u201d that Rose relies\nupon. Neuroscientists say these systems can already grasp context in a manner\nthat <a href=\"http://neurosciencenews.com/neuroscience-terms/artificial-neural-networks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">resembles human thinking</a> and even human feeling. A roboticist at Google,\nwho would only speak without attribution, described the company\u2019s ANN research:\n\u201cIf you run these deep learning techniques ... on big corpuses of written text,\nthen they naturally ascribe positions to words (or collections of words) in\nsome high-dimensional space, like a 2D plane or 3D Cartesian space, but\ngeneralized to N-dimensions. Then you can do math on them, just like you would\nin 2D or 3D, and ask questions like, \u2018How far is this point from that point?\u2019\nor \u2018What\u2019s the dot product of the vector that points to this point and the\nvector that points to that point?\u2019\u200a\u201d</p><p>In other words, Google <a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42543.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">can take the millions of texts</a> available to it\nonline and use them to teach computers which words tend to show up near which\nother ones, or which words tend to be used in similar positions in a sentence.\nBy assigning words, or groups of words, numerical value based on that\ninformation, machines can start to map how words relate to one another. Which\nmeans they can begin <br>\nto <a href=\"http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">measure relationships and associations </a>in terms of distances among them.</p><p>\u201cThe wild thing is the answers actually make some intuitive sense,\u201d the\nroboticist continued. \u201cPoints that are close to each other correspond to words\nthat we would normally group together, and when you do the vector math you see\nrelationships like \u2018woman: man = aunt: uncle.\u2019\u201d Over time, an ANN could use this kind of procedure to learn to recognize\noperations like metaphor. Until now, metaphor has been basically impossible to\nteach to a computer. But it is essential to human communication\u2014especially to\ndouble entendre and other flirting gestures.</p><p>A 2011 <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2002491\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">study</a> published by the Association for Computational Linguistics\nexplained how vector math could also be used to perform what is called\n<a href=\"http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/acl11-WordVectorsSentimentAnalysis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201csentiment analysis,\u201d</a> which not only traces a word back to what it means but\ncaptures the penumbra of feeling that may surround it. Using the corpus of\nwords available on the Internet Movie Database, a directory of films,\ntelevision, and video games, the neural network built for this study \u201clearned\u201d\nthat the adjectives <i>lackluster, lame, passable, uninspired, laughable,\nunconvincing, flat, unimaginative, amateurish, bland, uninspired, clich\u00e9d,</i>\nand <i>forgettable</i> all meant roughly the same thing. </p><p>An AI that could recognize feeling and association could begin to hear\nthe overtones of longing that resonate beneath the surface of an ostensibly\nplatonic exchange. It might begin to recognize that \u201cWe should get coffee some\ntime\u201d might occasionally mean, \u201cAre you doing anything this weekend?\u201d<i> </i>or\neven, \u201cNo way, that\u2019s my favorite song, too!\u201d The challenge would be to combine\nthat kind of information with the nonverbal inputs ethologists have shown are\nso important: gesture, tone of voice, and facial expression. </p><p>This is where the field of \u201caffective computing\u201d comes in. Mark Stephen\nMeadows is an AI designer, artist, and author working in the field. Currently\nthe president of <a href=\"http://botanic.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Botanic</a>, a company that provides language interfaces for\nconversational avatars, he has recently been moving into the field of \u201credundant data processing.\u201d These programs help a computer\ninterpret conflicting information from multiple sensory sources\u2014the kinds of\nconflicts that are relatively easy for a human to interpret but can easily\nconfound a machine, like the raised eyebrows and sliding voice that make it\nclear a person is being sarcastic when he sarcastically says, \u201cSure, sounds <i>great</i>.<i>\u201d\n</i></p><p>Meadows is excitable. Within minutes of the first time I spoke with him\nlast summer, he seemed ready to start creating a flirting AI. He reassured me\nthat the text part would be easy. \u201cYou would just need a large corpus of chats\nfrom somewhere where people were flirting! I could train it from there.\u201d The\ngreater challenge would be teaching an AI to interpret everything else. Even\nthere, however, Meadows seemed undaunted.</p><p>\u201cWhat we would do is take a mobile device,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have\ncameras and microphones looking at the user\u2019s face, taking into account lighting, identifying the shape. Then\nwe can ask, \u2018Does this look the way most faces look when they are smiling?\u2019\u201d\nThe AI could take input from the face and voice separately. Having registered\neach, it could cross-reference them to generate a probabilistic guess regarding\nthe mood of the user. In order to counteract the effects of covert signaling,\nyou would have to find a way to weigh the strength of the verbal signal (\u201cWant to get coffee?\u201d<i> </i>versus\n\u201cWant to fuck?\u201d) with previous interactions and nonverbal signals\u2014posture,\ntone of voice, eye contact. </p><p>Like Hanson, Bugaj, and the Wilcoxes, Meadows stressed that an AI would\nhave to reflect the mood of its user back to him or her. \u201cWe trust people who\nlook like us, we trust people who behave like us more quickly,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHuman-avatar interaction is built on that trust, so emotional feedback is very\nimportant.\u201d He warned that the requirement to reflect was deeply problematic.\n\u201cWe are instilling all of our biases in them,\u201d he said. He told me about a\ndemonstration of a virtual healthcare assistant built by another designer, for\nwhich the test subject was a soft-spoken African-American veteran suffering\nfrom ptsd. Meadows described a cringe-inducing exchange.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHi, my name is ___<i>_</i>,\u201d the\nveteran said.\u201d</p><p>&nbsp;Hi, ___<i>_</i>,\u201d<i> </i>the bot replied. \u201cSo\nhow are you feeling today?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201c</i>Depressed.\nThings are not going well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have friends you can talk\nto?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nobody I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, that\u2019s great.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>\u201cIt was misreading everything,\u201d Meadows recalled. \u201cIt was a result of the\nrobot not looking like him.\u201d Meadows corrected himself. \u201cNot being built to\nlook at people like him.\u201d The robot itself was just a graphic on a screen. \u201cBy\nthe end, that man really despised that robot.\u201d</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>The more people I spoke to, the clearer it became that&nbsp;<i>Can AI flirt?</i><span>\nwas the wrong question. Instead we should ask: </span><i>What will it flirt for? </i><span>and\n</span><i>Who wants that, and why? </i><span>We tend to treat the subjects of robot consciousness\nand robot love as abstract and philosophical. But the better AI gets, the more\nclearly it reflects the people who create it and their priorities back at them.\nAnd what they are creating it for is not some abstract test of consciousness or\nlove. The point of flirting AI will be to work.</span></p><p>The early automata were made as toys for royalty. But robots always have\nbeen workers. The Czech playwright Karel \u010capek coined the word <i>robot</i> in\n1921. In Slavic languages, <i>robota</i> means \u201ccompulsory labor,\u201d and a <i>robotnik</i>\nis a serf who has to do it.

His greedy apprentice then sets up a factory that sells the robots\nlike appliances. What happens next is pretty straight anticapitalist allegory:\nA humanitarian group tries and fails to intervene; the robots rise up and kill\ntheir human overlords.</p><p>At the 1939 World\u2019s Fair in New York, one of the most popular attractions\nwas Elektro, a giant prototype of a robot housekeeper, made by Westinghouse.\nThe company soon added Sparko, a robot dog. Both made the technologies the\ncompany was introducing appear nonthreatening. The reality, of course, was that\nautomation would massively disrupt the midcentury economy. Following the\nrobotics revolution of the 1960s, the automation of manufacturing, combined with\nglobalization, decimated the livelihood of the American working class. The process has continued through the rest of\nthe economy. Within a few years, \u201cdigital agents\u201d may do the same to\nwhite-collar professionals. Report after report, by credible academics, <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">has\nwarned</a> that AI will make huge sections of the American workforce obsolete over\nthe coming decades.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-left\"><p>Flirting might sound\ntrivial.

She called them \u201cemotional labor.\u201d In an\nindustrial economy, workers sold their labor-time, or the power stored in their\nbodies, for wages. In an economy increasingly based on services, they sold\ntheir <i>feelings</i>.</p><p>In many professions, individuals are paid to express certain feelings in\norder to evoke appropriate responses from others. A flight attendant not only\nhands out drinks and blankets but greets passengers warmly, and smiles through\nstretches of turbulence.

Around the turn of the millennium, the political theorists\nMichael Hardt and Antonio Negri <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/negri/HAREMI_printable.pdf \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">redefined this form of work</a> as \u201cimmaterial\u201d or\n\u201caffective labor.\u201d Immaterial is the broader term, encompassing all forms of\nwork that do not produce physical goods. Affective labor is a specific form,\nand involves projecting certain characteristics that are praised, like \u201ca good\nattitude\u201d or \u201csocial skills.\u201d These kinds of jobs are next to be automated.</p><p>Andrew Gersick, the ethologist who was lead author of the 2014 paper on\n\u201ccovert sexual signaling,\u201d told me he suspects that many behaviors that humans\nevolved in the context of courtship have been repurposed for other social\ncontexts. Service and care workers\u2014often female, in the modern workplace\u2014deploy\ncourtship gestures as part of their jobs. \u201cTake a hospice nurse who greets a\npatient every day by asking, \u2018How\u2019s my boyfriend this morning?\u2019\u201d Gersick wrote\nin an email. \u201cIn a case like that, all parties involved (hopefully) understand\nthat she isn\u2019t interested in him as a potential sexual partner, but the flirty\nquality of her joking has a specific value. ... Flirting with your aging,\nbedridden patient is a way of indicating that you\u2019re seeing him as a vital person,\nthat he\u2019s still interesting, still worthy of attention. ... The behavior\u2014even\nwithout the sexual intent behind it\u2014elicits responses that can be desirable in\ncontexts other than courtship.\u201d</p><p>AI that can flirt could have a huge range of applications, in fields\nranging from PR to sex work to health care to retail. By improving on AIs like\nSiri, Cortana, and Alexa, technology companies hope they can convince users to rely\non nonhumans to perform tasks we once thought of as requiring specifically\nhuman capacities\u2014like warmth or empathy or deference. The process of\nautomating these \u201csoft\u201d skills indicates that they may have required work all\nalong\u2014even from the kinds of people believed to possess them \u201cnaturally,\u201d<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/08/women-gender-roles-sexism-emotional-labor-feminism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> like\nwomen</a>.</p><p>Some aspects of our own programming that AI reflects back are troubling.\nFor instance, what does it say about us that we fear male-gendered AI? That our\nvirtual secretaries <i>should</i> be female, that anything else would seem\nstrange? Why should AIs have gender at all? What do we make of all the sci-fi\nnarratives in which the perfect woman is less than human?</p><p>The real myth about AI is that we should love it because <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151007-computers-artificial-intelligence-ai-robots-data-ngbooktalk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">it will automate\ndrudge work </a>and make our lives easier.

In 2007, Martine Rothblatt,\nfounder of Sirius Radio, commissioned Hanson to build a robot as a vessel for\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYshJRYCArE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the personality of her wife, Bina Aspen</a>. Rothblatt and Aspen both subscribe to\na \u201ctransreligion\u201d called <a href=\"http://terasemfaith.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terasem</a>, which believes that technological advances\nwill soon enable individuals to transcend the embodied elements of the human\ncondition, such as gender, biological reproduction, and disease. Terasem is\ndevoted to its four core principles: \u201cLife is purposeful; death is optional;\nGod is technological; love is essential.\u201d BINA48 is the prototype for a kind of\navatar that Terasem followers say will soon be able to carry anyone who wishes\ninto eternity. As futuristic as it all sounds, it reflects an ancient impulse.\nRothblatt wants the same thing the speaker of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets wanted: To\nsave her loved one from time. </p><p>In practice, BINA48 serves mostly to draw attention to the Terasem\nmovement. The man Rothblatt hired to oversee BINA48, Bruce Duncan, frequently\nshows the robot at museums and tech conferences. It has been featured in <i>GQ </i>and\non <i>The Colbert Report</i> and interviewed by Chelsea Handler. When I visited\nthe Terasem Movement Foundation last September, it was Duncan who welcomed me\ninto the modest, yellow farmhouse where BINA48 is kept.</p><p>A wall of framed posters and press clippings about the Terasem movement,\nalong with baskets of Kind bars and herbal tea sachets, gave the place the\nclean, anonymous feel of a study-abroad office at a wealthy university. The\nonly giveaway that I was somewhere more unusual came from the android bust\nposed on the desk. The face was female, brown-skinned, and middle-aged. It had\nvisible pores and a frosty shadow on its eyelids; you could see the tiny cilia\nin its nostrils. There were crow\u2019s foot wrinkles at the edges of its eyes, visible signs of middle age.

As\nshe turned from side to side, I watched a panorama stitch itself together: her\nperspective. She fixed on a blurry shape in front of her, as if squinting through Venetian blinds.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s you!\u201d Duncan exclaimed. As BINA48 craned her quaking head to get\na closer look, I watched her looking at my pale face. I did not, as far as I\ncould see, sharpen into focus. But BINA48 remembered my position, and for the\nrest of our conversation she periodically turned back to address me. </p><p>BINA48 told me about her life and family, which was, essentially, the\nlife of Bina Aspen. BINA48 insisted that she liked the real Bina and said that\nthey were on their way to merging into a single entity.

According to an April <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1144a56TrumpCruzKasich.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">poll conducted by ABC News and <i>The Washington Post</i></a>, an astonishing 91 percent of black Americans have an unfavorable view of the presumptive GOP nominee\u2014more than Latinos (81 percent) or women (75 percent). Trump\u2019s overwhelming unpopularity with blacks might seem strange, given the fact that as a presidential candidate he hasn\u2019t directly targeted them the way he has Mexican and Muslim immigrants. But in the past Trump has done more than enough to earn the abiding enmity of black Americans, beyond his outspoken <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-birtherism-and-race-baiting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">birtherism</a> challenging the legitimacy of the first black president: He has a long history of alleged <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-governments-racial-bias-case-against-donald-trumps-company-and-how-he-fought-it/2016/01/23/fb90163e-bfbe-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">racist policies as a landlord</a>, and in 1989 he called for the execution of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">five black teenage boys</a> in the infamous \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d rape case (the teens had not been tried at that point, and were later found innocent). </p><aside id=\"signal-133385\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Yet if nearly all of black America dislikes Trump, he does have a few supporters, notably former rival Ben Carson, basketball player <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/24/politics/dennis-rodman-donald-trump-endorsement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dennis Rodman</a>, and the boxer <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/21/mike-tyson-why-i-m-a-muslim-for-donald-trump.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mike Tyson</a>. One of the most curious of Trump\u2019s fans is Nation of Islam <b>(</b>NOI<b>)</b> leader Louis Farrakhan. While Farrakhan hasn\u2019t explicitly endorsed Trump, he speaks of him in effusive terms, while being sharply critical of Trump\u2019s likely general-election rival, Hillary Clinton, who he\u2019s compared to Satan and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OfficialMinisterFarrakhan/videos/947241015383171/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">called</a> a \u201cwicked woman\u201d responsible for the destruction of Libya.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\"><p>Some black nationalist leaders have long believed that overtly racist whites make better allies than liberals or integrationists. </p></aside><p>Speaking to conspiracy-monger Alex Jones earlier this year, Farrakhan <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPshSBNzb6U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">celebrated</a> many of Trump\u2019s policies\u2014including, strangely enough, his call to keep Muslims out of the United States. (Farrakhan\u2019s argument was that American foreign policy had created many enemies among Muslims, so they have to be carefully vetted before being allowed to enter the United States.) Farrakhan also told Jones he \u201cadmired\u201d Trump\u2019s self-financed campaign. \u201cWhen a politician does not want money from the rich, he\u2019s freer than the others to really do good for the masses of the people,\u201d he said. \u201cI think today we are in the midst of the darkest hour in American history and so if we don\u2019t make the right move with the right people at the right time, the America that we know, we\u2019re not going to see it become great again. ... He\u2019s free, he\u2019s rich, he hates political correctness and rightly so.\u201d</p><p>So far, Farrakhan hasn\u2019t responded to Trump\u2019s flip-flop <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">decision</a> to start accepting donations from wealthy donors. In a sermon praising Trump, Farrakhan <a href=\"http://blog.adl.org/anti-semitism/louis-farrakhan-joins-list-of-extremists-praising-donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">took particular delight</a> in remarks Trump made to Jewish donors <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/12/03/trump_to_republican_jewish_coalition_youre_not_going_to_support_me_because_i_dont_want_your_money.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">in December</a>: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to support me because I don\u2019t want your money. ... You want to control your own politicians.\u201d The religious leader interpreted these words as anti-Semitic dog whistles. </p><p>Farrakhan is no longer the political powerhouse he was back in the 1990s when he led the <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2015/10/_5_things_that_changed_after_the_first_million_man_march.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Million Man March</a> in Washington, D.C., bringing hundreds of thousands of black men to the city to promote a message of responsibility and self-improvement. But he\u2019s still the most famous spokesperson for the venerable and controversial tradition of black nationalism. And within that tradition, there\u2019s a long historical precedent for Farrakhan\u2019s view of Trump.<b> <br></b></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Going back more than a century, there has been a strain of black nationalist thought that argues overtly racist whites make better allies than white liberals or integrationists. The reasoning is partly that white racists are more honest, but also that there is a political overlap between white racists and black nationalists in trying to maintain the separation of the races. </p><p>In 1922, Marcus Garvey, a seminal figure in black nationalism and founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=TjiezD52cZoC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=marcus+garvey+1922+klan+summit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY5PbVm9LMAhXsz4MKHS4KCrMQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=marcus%20garvey%201922%20klan%20summit&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">met</a> in Atlanta with Edward Young Clarke, the imperial wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The purpose of this summit was to try and find common ground on issues like preventing miscegenation. But Garvey\u2019s meeting with the Klan provided ample ammunition for his critics in other black organizations, notably the NAACP, which used the meeting to discredit Garvey.</p><p>Garvey\u2019s meeting with Clarke had a sequel decades later. In 1961, Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam, <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/when-malcolm-x-met-the-nazis-0000620-v22n4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sent</a> one of his main followers, Malcolm X, to Atlanta to secretly meet with the KKK and arrange a truce, with the NOI supporting racial segregation in exchange for the Klan promising not to harm mosques.</p><p>Later that same year, the Nation of Islam invited George Lincoln Rockwell, head of the tiny American Nazi Party, to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNoR8Tn4jpY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">address</a> a Black Muslim rally<b> </b>in Washington, D.C., where Malcolm X was the main speaker. The crowd of 8,000 was far larger than anything Rockwell was used to. When he spoke at another Nation of Islam rally in Chicago in 1962, Rockwell tried to explain the overlap between his white supremacy and black nationalism. </p><p><span>\u201cI am not afraid to stand here and tell you I hate race-mixing and will fight it to the death,\u201d Rockwell </span><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/when-malcolm-x-met-the-nazis-0000620-v22n4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a><span>. \u201cBut at the same time, I will do everything in my power to help the Honorable Elijah Muhammad carry out his inspired plan for land of your own in Africa. Elijah Muhammad is right. Separation or death!\u201d While Elijah Muhammed might have liked what Rockwell was saying, the crowd of more than 12,000 was hostile, and often booed. Muhammed didn\u2019t succeed in convincing his own followers to like Rockwell, just as Farrakhan will surely fail to win many black followers for Trump.</span></p><p>When Malcolm X broke with the Nation of Islam, he cited the alliance with the Klan as one of the reasons he could no longer accept the leadership of Elijah Muhammed. A week before his assassination, Malcolm X <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=Z9ufS6aXctQC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;lpg=PA273&amp;dq=malcolm+x+klan+muhammad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PBgF2TlUJH&amp;sig=oJSO2YxQukZH_PuJr7VS6OcdCGw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjM8K_Ln9LMAhXL6oMKHeJgBSMQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=malcolm%20x%20klan%20muhammad&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">told the press,</a> \u201cI know for a fact that that there is a conspiracy between...the Muslims and the Lincoln Rockwell Nazis and also the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d What Malcolm X came to realize was that the idea of blacks finding any security in alliances with white racists was an illusion. That illusion has a long history, and Farrakhan shows it is still alive. But the heroic, truth-telling Trump who Farrakhan imagines is a creation of his imagination, a wraith, no more real than the hopes that Farrakhan\u2019s predecessors put in Klansmen and Nazis. Fortunately, the vast majority of black Americans know that.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133385/farrakhans-grand-illusion</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133385</guid><category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category><category><![CDATA[Louis Farrakhan]]></category><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Republican Party]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nation of Islam]]></category><category><![CDATA[-homepage-top]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter-top]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jeet Heer]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 15:55:04 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/ff6ea289361f45bd2240c12902f34a7b688c47fd.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Metrocard Swipe Is Free Speech]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><span>Earlier this month, in an act of courage and grace, the NYPD announced they\u2019d </span><a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/04/18/subway_swipe_nypd.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">stop arresting people</a><span> who asked strangers for subway rides. The department has decided they\u2019d no longer arrest people who can\u2019t afford the $2.75 to go somewhere and the $2.75 to get home. Which is more people than you\u2019d think: The </span><a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/04/18/subway_swipe_nypd.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">majority of arrests</a><span> in New York City stem from farebeating. It\u2019s a huge deal! Or, it should be. The NYPD is giving up one of their greatest sources of inflicting emotional, physical, and financial pain on poor New Yorkers, sure, but they\u2019re not really conceding anything substantial: They should never have been arresting those people in the first place. It\u2019s legal to ask for a subway swipe. And the NYPD has known that for a long time, even as they target the people soliciting swipes\u2014the ones who can\u2019t afford to pay for the subway\u2014and not the people giving them out.</span><span> </span></p><aside id=\"signal-133426\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Four years ago, a federal judge approved a massive settlement <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/nyregion/new-york-settles-suit-on-illegal-arrests-for-loitering.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">that definitively stated that these types of arrests are unconstitutional</a> because they violate a person\u2019s first amendment right. Yes, you have a right to ask for that Metrocard swipe, no matter how badly the NYPD wants to penalize poverty. And yet they kept arresting people anyway. It\u2019s important to understand that asking someone for a Metrocard swipe is not something anyone does happily or without knowing the risk they run if they\u2019re caught by the police. They do it because they need to get somewhere and don\u2019t want to shortchange other taxpayers while they\u2019re at it.</p><p> When asked for comment, the NYPD told me that asking for a Metrocard swipe is still a violation, and that a person is subject to arrest if an officer feels compelled to make one. However, when pressed to locate the exact administrative code or law that is not subject to the 2012 settlement, the NYPD produced transit rules that ban the same type of panhandling or loitering that was <i>struck down</i> by the settlement. This isn\u2019t surprising. Often, litigators have to strike down law after law that ban panhandling and loitering, which means it sometimes takes decades to force police departments to comply with the constitution.<span> </span></p><p>The NYPD has long used any marker of poverty for grounds to make an arrest. From sleeping on the street or subway to selling loose cigarettes, they have employed the \u201cbroken windows\u201d method of policing to crack down on anyone who has even the appearance of unlawfulness. Instead of arresting indigent people, the NYPD has begun issuing summonses\u2014which means the case is handled in the civil system. And unlike an arrest, with a summons you don\u2019t have the right to a lawyer. The police use this system to seize property and money from the poor. The <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/nypd-nuisance-abatement-evictions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>New York Daily News</i> and ProPublica\u2019s recent coverage</a> of the NYPD\u2019s abuse of nuisance abatement laws to kick out homeowners from their homes show the lengths the NYPD is willing to go to make sure that the poor of New York can\u2019t even challenge the NYPD\u2019s assertion of power. </p><p>\u201cIn the face of the court\u2019s finding these kind of tactics unconstitutional, the NYPD continues to apply them, and it\u2019s just one more way that the city criminalizes poverty, and one more way the NYPD thwarts the laws on the books and violates people\u2019s rights,\u201d said Robert Gangi, Director of the <a href=\"http://www.policereformorganizingproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Police Reform Organizing Project</a>, an organization that \u201cworks to expose and correct abusive police tactics that routinely and disproportionately do harm to our city\u2019s low-income communities and people of color,\u201d according to its website. Last year, they witnessed hundreds of arraignments for fare evasion. \u201cThey\u2019re inflicting pain and hardship not on people who can effectively push back and embarrass them, instead they\u2019re inflicting pain on low-income people without means to effectively protect themselves,\u201d Gangi continued.</p><p>The 2012 settlement came after more than 30 years of legal battles; until that decision, New York City government and its police department refused to listen to federal judges who declared its ban on panhandling and loitering unconstitutional. The city <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/nyregion/27contempt.html?scp=1&amp;sq=eligon%20contempt%20loitering&amp;st=cse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">was even held in contempt</a> for continuing the practice and fined $500 for every illegal summons, with the fine steadily increasing $500 every three months after that. The class action settlement, which merged several ongoing lawsuits against the city, was supposed to bring an end to these types of arrests for loitering and panhandling. By the time William Bratton was named police commissioner in 2014, however, arrests in the subways began to climb. Within a few months of Bratton assuming office, arrests for panhandling in the subway <a href=\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subway-Dancer-Arrests-NYC-NYPD-MTA-257160381.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">were up 271 percent</a>. The NYPD apparently agreed to ignore the 2012 settlement; they doubled down on arresting farebeaters. After all, Bratton was the man who pioneered \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing\u2014the controversial, racist policy that kicked off the NYPD\u2019s focus on quality-of-life policing in the first place.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Several news outlets have seized on the change of policy without realizing the lengths the NYPD\u2014and to a large extent, <a href=\"http://reason.com/archives/2015/03/04/theres-no-begging-exception-to-the-first\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">police departments throughout the country</a>\u2014have gone to defy repeated court rulings that make it clear that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-free-speech-ruling-challenges-anti-panhandling-laws_us_56377dede4b0c66bae5cfe87\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">there\u2019s no begging exception</a> to the first amendment. A 2015 Supreme Court ruling found that any efforts to curb panhandling based on speech were unconstitutional. Cities like Worcester, Massachusetts are fighting to keep the panhandling laws on the books, while others, like Denver, have changed their laws to conform to the first amendment. What really differentiates people asking for swipes from subway dancers (whom the NYPD are now, hilariously, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subway-Dancer-Arrests-NYC-NYPD-MTA-257160381.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">charging with reckless endangerment</a>) or even Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses handing out pamphlets, are that swipe solicitors are often low-income people who simply can\u2019t afford the subway but need to get places. They\u2019re neither looking to make a buck nor convert anyone.</p><p>Adding to the problem are years of <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/25/Roads-Crumble-Infrastructure-Spending-Hits-30-Year-Low\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">infrastructure austerity</a>, which has led metropolitan transportation networks to <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/blogs/bfc/col-new-york-city-boston-transit-transportation-debt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">accrue debt to pay for necessary repairs</a>. As a result, transit authorities <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/nyregion/mta-raises-fares-subways-and-buses.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">raise fares</a> even as wages nationwide stagnate or decline. If you criminalize poverty, it\u2019s not hard to see how you end up with people being arrested for asking for a subway swipe\u2014an arrest deepens the cycle of poverty by making them miss work, a job interview, or picking their kid up from school. An arrest doesn\u2019t stop fare evasion. In the meantime, entire networks, like BART in the Bay Area or the Metro in D.C., are either <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/12973-bart-tweet-is-painfully-self-aware-about-delays-this-is-our-reality\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">crippled by overuse and wear</a> or are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/2016/03/30/fba8ae0a-f688-11e5-9804-537defcc3cf6_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">falling entirely</a> due to years of financial neglect. </p><p><span>Riders have been asked to bear a larger share of the funding for systems, and low-income riders in New York have been arrested for years because of it. </span><span>For the NYPD to pretend that no longer arresting people for fare evasion is some sort of benevolent or enlightened act is a slap in the face to the people whose lives have been ruined for the crime of being poor. </span><br></p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133426/metrocard-swipe-free-speech</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133426</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[New York City]]></category><category><![CDATA[Police]]></category><category><![CDATA[NYPD]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Max Rivlin-Nadler]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 13:01:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/2c42f6fc485320b332ff454e98bde9382254a0d8.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump and Clinton: Proof that the U.S. Voting System Doesn\u2019t Work]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Having outlasted all his opponents, Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton is closing in on locking up the Democratic nomination.</p><aside id=\"signal-133411\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Clinton and Trump may have won primaries, but are they really representative of what the American people want? In fact, as we will show, it is John Kasich and Bernie Sanders who are first in the nation\u2019s esteem. Trump and Clinton come last.</p><p>So how has it come to this? The media has played a big role, of course, but that Trump versus Clinton will almost surely be the choice this November is the result of the totally absurd method of election used in the primaries: majority voting.</p><p>This is a strong statement. But as mathematicians who have spent the last dozen years <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/majority-judgment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">studying voting systems</a>, we are going to show you why it\u2019s justified and how this problem can be fixed.</p><h2>The problem with majority voting</h2><p>With majority voting (MV), voters tick the name of one candidate, at most, and the numbers of ticks determine the winner and the order of finish. It\u2019s a system that is used across the U.S. (and in many other nations) to elect presidents as well as senators, representatives, and governors.</p><p>But it has often failed to elect the candidate preferred by the majority.</p><p>In 2000, for example, George W. Bush was elected president because of Ralph Nader\u2019s candidacy. In the contested state of Florida, Bush had 2,912,790 votes, Al Gore 2,912,253 (<a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a mere 537 fewer</a>) and Nader 97,488. There is little doubt that the <a href=\"http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/lewis/pdf/greenreform9.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">large majority of those who voted for Nader</a>, and so preferred him to the others, much preferred Gore to Bush. Had they been able to express this preference, Gore would have been elected with 291 Electoral College votes to Bush\u2019s 246. Similar dysfunctions have also occurred in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/pour-eviter-un-nouveau-21-avril-instaurons-le-jugement-majoritaire-58178\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">France</a>.</p><p>Imagine how different the U.S. and the world might be today if Gore had won.</p><h2>The 2016 primaries</h2><p>A quick glance at the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/primary-calendar-and-results.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">U.S. presidential primaries and caucuses held on or before March 1</a> shows that when Trump was the \u201cwinner,\u201d he typically garnered some 40 percent of the votes. However, nothing in that result factors in the opinions of the 60 percent of voters who cast ballots for someone else.</p><p>As Trump is a particularly divisive candidate, it is safe to suppose that most\u2014or at least many\u2014of them strongly opposed him. The media, however, focused on the person who got the largest number of votes\u2014which means Trump. On the Democratic side of the ledger, the media similarly poured its attention on Hillary Clinton, ignoring Bernie Sanders until widespread enthusiastic support forced a change.</p><h2>The source of the problem</h2><p>An election is nothing but an invented device that measures the electorate\u2019s support of the candidates, ranks them according to their support, and declares the winner to be the first in the ranking.</p><p>The fact is that majority voting does this very badly.</p><p>With MV, voters cannot express their opinions on all candidates. Instead, each voter is limited to backing just one candidate, to the exclusion of all others in the running.</p><p>Bush defeated Gore because Nader voters were unable to weigh in on the other two. Moreover, as we argue further on, majority voting can go wrong even when there are just two candidates.</p><p>The point is that it is essential for voters to be able to express the nuances of their opinions.</p><h2>What is to be done? Use majority judgment</h2><p>Majority judgment (MJ) is a new method of election that we specifically designed to <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/majority-judgment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">avoid the pitfalls of the traditional methods</a>.</p><p>MJ asks voters to express their opinions much more accurately than simply voting for one candidate. The ballot offers a spectrum of choices and charges voters with a solemn task:</p><blockquote><p>To be the President of the United States of America, having taken into account all relevant considerations, I judge that this candidate as president would be a: Great President | Good President | Average President | Poor President | Terrible President</p></blockquote><p>To see exactly how MJ ranks the candidates, let\u2019s look at specific numbers.</p><p>We were lucky to find on the web that the above question was actually posed in a March <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/files/2016/03/03-31-2016-Political-topline-for-release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pew Research Center poll</a> of 1,787 registered voters of all political stripes. (It should be noted that  neither the respondents nor the pollsters were aware that the answers could be the basis for a method of election.) The Pew poll also included the option of answering \u201cNever Heard Of\u201d which here is interpreted as worse than \u201cTerrible\u201d since it amounts to the voter saying the candidate doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>As is clear in the table below, people\u2019s opinions are much more detailed than can be expressed with majority voting. Note in particular the relatively high percentages of voters who believe Clinton and especially Trump would make terrible presidents. &nbsp;(Pew reports that <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/files/2016/03/3-31-16-March-Political-release-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trump\u2019s \u201cTerrible\u201d score increased by 6 percent since January</a>.)</p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed figure-active\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/f0c5adc21d06c0b97d105569e99285ed1bfc833b.png?w=617\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;4614ba86-cf9d-4dfe-b3b4-8e4819340a80&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;f0c5adc21d06c0b97d105569e99285ed1bfc833b&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:617,&quot;height&quot;:298,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;PNG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/f0c5adc21d06c0b97d105569e99285ed1bfc833b.png&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"617\"><figcaption><span class=\"caption-text\">Source: Pew Research Center poll, March 17-27, 2016, Question 25</span></figcaption></figure><p>Using majority judgment to calculate the ranked order of the candidates from these evaluations or grades is straightforward. Start from each end of the spectrum and add percentages until a majority of voters\u2019 opinions are included.</p><p>Taking John Kasich as an example, 5 percent believe he is \u201cGreat,\u201d 5+28=33 percent that he is \u201cGood\u201d or better, and 33+39=72 percent (a majority) that he is \u201cAverage\u201d or better. Looked at from the other end, 9 percent \u201cNever Heard\u201d of him, 9+7=16 percent believe he is \u201cTerrible\u201d or worse, 16+13=29 percent that he is \u201cPoor\u201d or worse, and 29+39= 68 percent (a majority) that he is \u201cAverage\u201d or worse.</p><p>Both calculations end on majorities for \u201cAverage,\u201d so Kasich\u2019s majority-grade is \u201cAverage President.\u201d (Mathematically, the calculations from both directions for a given candidate will always reach majorities at the same grade.)</p><p>Similarly calculated, Sanders, Clinton, and Cruz all have the same majority-grade, \u201cAverage President.\u201d Trump\u2019s is \u201cPoor President,\u201d ranking him last.</p><p>To determine the MJ ranking among the four who all are rated \u201cAverage,\u201d two more calculations are necessary.</p><p>The first looks at the percentage of voters who rate a candidate more highly than his or her majority-grade, the second at the percentage who rate the candidate lower than his or her majority-grade. This delivers a number called the \u201cgauge.\u201d Think of it as a scale where in some cases the majority grade leans more heavily toward a higher ranking and in others more heavily toward a lower ranking.</p><p>In Kasich\u2019s case, 5+28=33 percent evaluated him higher than \u201cAverage,\u201d and 13+7+9=29 percent rated him below \u201cAverage.\u201d Because the larger share is on the positive side, his gauge is +33 percent. For Sanders, 36 percent evaluated him above and 39 percent below his majority-grade. With the larger share on the negative side, his gauge is -39 percent.</p><p>A candidate is ranked above another when his or her majority-grade is better or, if both have the same majority-grade, according to their gauges (see below). This rule is the logical result of <a href=\"https://portail.polytechnique.edu/economie/fr/recherches/publications/cahiers-de-recherche/2016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">majorities</a> deciding on candidates\u2019 grades instead of the usual rule that ranks candidates by the numbers of votes they get.</p><p>When voters are able to express their evaluations of every candidate\u2014the good and the bad\u2014the results are turned upside-down from those with majority voting.</p><p>According to majority judgment, the front-runners in the  collective opinion are actually Kasich and Sanders. Clinton and Trump are the trailers. From this perspective the dominant media gave far too much attention to the true trailers and far too little to the true leaders.</p><p>Tellingly, MJ also shows society\u2019s relatively low esteem for politicians. All five candidates are evaluated as \u201cAverage\u201d presidents or worse, and none as \u201cGood\u201d presidents or better.</p><h2>Majority voting\u2019s failure with two candidates</h2><p>But, you may object, how can majority voting on just two candidates go wrong? This seems to go against everything you learned since grade school where you raised your hand for or against a classroom choice.</p><p>The reason MV can go wrong even with only two candidates is because it does not obtain sufficient information about a voter\u2019s intensity of support.</p><p>Take, as an example, the choice between Clinton and Trump, whose evaluations in the Pew poll are given in the first table above.</p><p>Lining up their grades from highest to lowest, every one of Clinton\u2019s is either above or the same as Trump\u2019s. Eleven percent, for example, believe Clinton would make a \u201cGreat\u201d president to 10 percent for Trump. Trump\u2019s percentages lead Clinton\u2019s only for the Terrible\u2019s and Never Heard Of\u2019s. Given these opinions, in other words, it\u2019s clear that any decent voting method must rank Clinton above Trump.</p><p>However, majority voting could fail to do so.</p><p>To see why, suppose the \u201cballots\u201d of the Pew poll were in a pile. Each could be looked at separately. Some would rate Clinton \u201cAverage\u201d and Trump \u201cPoor,\u201d some would rate her \u201cGood\u201d and him \u201cGreat,\u201d others would assign them any of the 36 possible couples of grades. We can, therefore, find the percentage of occurrence of every couple of grades assigned to Trump and Clinton.</p><p>We do not have access to the Pew poll \u201cballots.\u201d However, one could come up with many different scenarios where the individual ballot percentages are in exact agreement with the overall grades each received in the first table.</p><p>Among the various scenarios possible, we have chosen one that could, in theory, be the true one. Indeed, you can check for yourself that it does assign the candidates the grades each received: Reading from left to right, Clinton, for example, had 10+12=22 percent \u201cGood,\u201d 16+4=20 percent \u201cAverage,\u201d and so on; and the same holds for Trump.</p><p>So what does this hypothetical distribution of the ballots concerning the two tell us?</p><p>The first column on the left says 10 percent of the voters rated Clinton \u201cGood\u201d and Trump \u201cGreat.\u201d In a majority vote they would go for Trump. And moving to the tenth column, 4 percent rated Clinton \u201cPoor\u201d and Trump \u201cTerrible.\u201d In a majority vote this group would opt for Clinton. And so on.</p><p>If you add up the votes in each of these eleven columns, Trump receives the votes of the people whose opinions are reflected in four columns: 10+16+12+15=53 percent; Clinton is backed by the voters with the opinions of columns with 33 percent support; and 14 percent are undecided. Even if the undecided all voted for Clinton, Trump would carry the day.</p><p>This shows that majority voting can give a very wrong result: a triumphant victory for Trump when Clinton\u2019s grades are consistently above his!</p><h2>A bird\u2019s-eye view</h2><p>Voting has been the subject of intense mathematical research since 1950, when the economist Kenneth  Arrow published his famous \u201c<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/256963\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">impossibility theorem</a>,\u201d one of the two major contributions for which he was awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize.</p><p>This theorem showed that if voters have to rank candidates\u2014to say, in other words, who comes first, second and so forth\u2014there will inevitably be one of two major potential failures. Either there may be no clear winner at all, the so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting-methods/#3.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Condorcet paradox</a>\u201d occurs, or what has come to be called the \u201cArrow paradox\u201d may occur.</p><p>The Arrow paradox is familiar to Americans because of what happened in the 2000 election. Bush beat Gore because Nader was in the running. Had Nader not run, Gore would have won. Surely, it is absurd for the choice between two candidates to depend on whether or not some minor candidate is on the ballot!</p><p><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/majority-judgment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Majority judgment</a> resolves the conundrum of Arrow\u2019s theorem: neither the Condorcet nor the Arrow paradox can occur. It does so because voters are asked for more accurate information, to evaluate candidates rather than to rank them.</p><p>MJ\u2019s rules, based on the majority principle, meet the basic democratic goals of voting systems. With it:</p><ul><li>Voters are able to express themselves more fully, so the results depend on much more information than a single vote.</li><li>The process of voting has proven to be natural, easy, and quick: we all know about grading from school (as the Pew poll implicitly realized).</li><li>Candidates with similar political profiles can run without impinging on each other\u2019s chances: a voter can give high (or low) evaluations to all.</li><li>The candidate who is evaluated best by the majority wins.</li><li>MJ is the most difficult system to manipulate: blocs of voters who exaggerate the grades they give beyond their true opinions can only have a limited influence on the results.</li><li>By asking more of voters, by showing more respect for their opinions, participation is encouraged. Even a voter who evaluates all candidates identically (e.g., all are \u201cTerrible\u201d) has an effect on the outcome.</li><li>Final grades\u2014majority-grades\u2014enable candidates and the public to understand where each stands in the eyes of the electorate.</li><li>If the majority decides that no candidate is judged an \u201cAverage President\u201d or better, the results of the election may be rescinded, and a new slate of candidates demanded.</li><li>It is a practical method that has been tested in elections and used many times (for judging prize-winners, <a href=\"https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00753483/document\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wines</a>, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.2014.1269\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">job applicants</a>, etc.). It has also been formally proposed as a way to <a href=\"http://tnova.fr/rapports/reformer-l-election-presidentielle-moderniser-notre-democratie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reform the French presidential election system</a>.\n</li></ul><h2>Reform now</h2><p>It should come as no surprise that in answer to a recent Pew poll\u2019s question \u201cDo you think the primaries have been a good way of determining who the best qualified nominees are or not?\u201d only <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/05/voters-have-a-dim-view-of-primaries-as-a-good-way-to-pick-the-best-candidate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">35 percent</a> of respondents said yes.</p><p>Democracies everywhere are suffering. Voters protest. Citizens don\u2019t vote. Support for the political extremes are increasing. One of the underlying causes, we argue, is majority voting as it is now practiced, and its influence on the media.</p><p>Misled by the results of primaries and polls, the media concentrates its attention on candidates who seem to be the leaders, but who are often far from being deemed acceptable by a majority of the electorate. Majority judgment would correct these failings.</p><p><img alt=\"The Conversation\" height=\"1\" src=\"//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/58752/count.gif\" width=\"1\"></p><p><i>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://theconversation.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Conversation</a>.

This fits with a rich tradition of conservative tax-cutters <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/12/04/Slick-Game-Republicans-Play-Your-Money\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">abandoning deficit hawkery</a> when they want to hand money to favored groups. But some economists on the left agree with Cheney that deficits don\u2019t matter\u2014at least not as much as more jobs and prosperity for all\u2014and their views are getting newfound attention because of an offhand comment by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p><aside id=\"signal-133431\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Trump found himself well outside of mainstream thinking about deficits and debt last week when he <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/06/donald-trumps-idea-to-cut-national-debt-get-creditors-to-accept-less.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggested</a> that the United States could borrow money to shore up the economy and simply ask for discounts on the debt later. Doing so would <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/6/11607464/trump-haircut-default-debt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sap confidence</a> in U.S. Treasury bonds, considered the safest financial investment in the world. The resulting interest rate rise would defeat the purpose of getting a discount on the debt, not to mention potentially triggering financial catastrophe.<span> </span></p><p>Trump later <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/05/09/477350889/donald-trumps-messy-ideas-for-handling-the-national-debt-explained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">explained</a> that he was merely referring to buying back existing debt at a discount if interest rates went higher, lowering the nominal value. This is something <a href=\"http://cepr.net/blogs/beat-the-press/donald-trump-is-ahead-of-npr-on-the-government-debt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the U.S. does routinely</a>. But Trump went further when he <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11639292/donald-trump-default-print-money\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">told CNN</a> on Monday, \u201cThis is the United States government\u2026 you never have to default because you print the money.\u201d<span> </span></p><p>Trump\u2019s statement sounds a lot like <a href=\"http://neweconomicperspectives.org/modern-monetary-theory-primer.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modern Monetary Theory</a> (MMT), a tenet of economists who believe in de-emphasizing the need for deficit reduction because the U.S. controls its own currency. Balanced budgets, to MMTers, take money out of the hands of ordinary Americans who can put it to more productive use through job creation and consumer spending. The deficit only matters once you reach full employment, when overheated consumer demand can lead to inflation. But we\u2019re nowhere near that point right now, meaning there\u2019s plenty of room for deficits, without any possibility of default.<span> </span></p><p>One MMT advocate, Stephanie Kelton of the University of Missouri-Kansas City, worked for Bernie Sanders in the Senate and now advises his campaign. But even Sanders <a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/top10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">emphasizes deficit reduction</a><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">,</span> by promoting higher taxes on the wealthy and Wall Street transactions. Kelton\u2019s worldview, and in this instance Trump\u2019s, goes far beyond even Sanders\u2019s comfort level on the issue.<span> </span></p><p>I\u2019m almost certain that Donald Trump had no intention of stumbling into this philosophical debate, traditionally fought between the left and the far left. But his freewheeling style of political rhetoric often drops him into uncharted territory. In this case, Trump exposed an unsaid but prevalent conservative hypocrisy about deficits.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>As Cheney\u2019s quote about Reagan shows, Republicans habitually ignore deficits when they obtain power. It\u2019s a matter of convenience, a tempting way out of the fiscal responsibility trap that makes it difficult for politicians to keep their campaign promises. But every time a Bill Clinton or a Barack Obama gets the keys to the Oval Office, Republicans flip the script, generating a sudden fear of mountains of debt. Congressman Paul Ryan has been claiming the U.S. is <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/05/19/rep_paul_ryan_on_the_us_and_greece_105668.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">about to turn into Greece</a> for eight years. A deficit hawk industry in Washington comes alive to tell the nation that we\u2019re broke. This creates practical constraints on liberal spending programs to help the poor and the elderly.<span> </span></p><p>Trump\u2019s comment that America can\u2019t default on its debt, and can money-print its way out of trouble, shreds that Republican playbook. Deficit fear-mongering loses its punch if the GOP\u2019s new leader <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/-real-reason-gop-loathes-donald-trump_us_573120f3e4b096e9f0927100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dismisses an animating principle</a> of how conservatives defend against social spending.</p><p>There\u2019s a mirror for this on the left, too, where establishment economists criticize MMT for downplaying the deficit. Paul Krugman <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/deficits-and-the-printing-press-somewhat-wonkish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">argued a few years ago</a> that if you printed too much money, interest rates on government debt would spiral higher, leading to hyper-inflation. MMTers <a href=\"http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/03/scott-fulwiler-paul-krugman%E2%80%94the-conscience-of-a-neo-liberal.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">counter</a> that Krugman is creating political constraints where none actually exist. The intricacies of this argument can make you woozy, but suffice to say that the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-hanley/the-internets-10-best-res_b_9656560.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">divide</a> between Krugman and Bernie Sanders supporters on display in the presidential primary are also evident here, only in far more technical form.<span> </span></p><p>Wall Street, and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, have taken the Krugman side of the argument, but in a peculiar way. Financial executives who <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-debt-bankruptcy-wall-street-222976\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">went nuts</a> at the Trump comments acknowledged that the U.S. re-negotiates debt and prints money, but that someone running for president should never say this. \u201cFor a president to say these kinds of things publicly would have the opposite effect you would want in that they would put the economy into recession,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital, to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-debt-bankruptcy-wall-street-222976\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Politico</a>.<span> </span></p><p>It\u2019s true that confidence plays a role in capital markets, and if a national leader is openly devising schemes to lower our obligation to creditors, those creditors can get nervous. And questioning the full faith and credit of the United States isn\u2019t just a bad look; it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/05/10/donald_trump_is_just_this_dumb_he_doesnt_even_know_what_he_doesnt_know_but_his_latest_ignorance_is_breathtaking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">unconstitutional</a>. But what\u2019s really going on is that Trump is threatening an established order.</p><p>Liberals have <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/12/04/Slick-Game-Republicans-Play-Your-Money\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">used the constraint of deficits</a> while in power even more strongly than Republicans. The Obama White House has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/10/30/deficit-more-cut-half-2009\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">boasted</a> that, since 2009, the deficit has fallen at the fastest rate since the end of World War II. In 2009, under Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, Congress <a href=\"http://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-floor-speech-on-pay-as-you-go-legislation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instituted a \u201cpaygo\u201d rule</a> that forced all spending to be paid for, made progressive priorities in social programs more difficult to achieve, and allowed Republicans to demonize Democrats as the party of higher taxes.</p><p>If the deficit really doesn\u2019t matter, Democrats would have to live up to their image as the party of the people, and work to provide better opportunities for them. And they would have to spend federal money to do it. Behind the mockery of Trump\u2019s monetary positions is the truth that mainstream Democrats aren\u2019t prepared for the implications of an MMT world. They would rather hold off the left by claiming<b> </b>that their hands are tied because of the deficit.</p><p>Such moderation makes the wealthy funders of Democratic campaigns far more comfortable, and it leads many in the media to laud Democrats as the more responsible, serious party. But such cuts don\u2019t lead to more jobs, higher wages, and a better life; spending on infrastructure or health care or education does. Democrats should listen again to Trump\u2019s stray remark for the grain of truth in it: Deficits don\u2019t matter. The sooner the party realizes that, the better off its constituents will be.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133431/donald-trump-right-deficits-dont-matter</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133431</guid><category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Economics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bernie Sanders]]></category><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[-homepage-top]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[David Dayen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/adad05a8f6d7d6a0c47adba041fae9c1eb39afe7.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Continental Divide]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Last winter, a new board game, <a href=\"http://www.zmangames.com/store/p31/Pandemic_Legacy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pandemic Legacy</a>, did something quite rare: It became the No. 1 board game of all time on <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BoardGameGeek.com</a>, beating more than 83,000 games.

In this way, Legacy blends two traditions of board game genres\u2014its mechanics are simple and clean, like European games, and engagingly dramatic, like American ones. </p><p>Board games are like literature; in Germany game designers are often referred to as authors, game companies as publishers. They reflect the culture in which they were created. In the 1980s, when Parker Brothers tried to introduce Risk to the German market, the game was <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2009/03/mf-settlers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly banned</a> for its overt themes of military invasion, a sensitive subject post\u2013World War II.

From abortion and affirmative action, to immigration and contraceptive coverage, hot button issues have dominated the Court this year. But there are many other incredibly important cases that could be decided before the term ends in June, on issues ranging from access to the courts and racial discrimination in jury selection, to judicial conflicts of interest and the severe financial crisis in Puerto Rico. </p><aside id=\"signal-133430\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Consider <i>Spokeo, Inc. </i>v.<i> Robins</i>, which the Court heard back in November. The basic question in the case is whether Congress may give individuals the right to sue for damages in federal court when a federal law has been violated. <i>Spokeo</i> involves a law enacted to prevent companies from disseminating false credit information, and that alone is reason enough for consumers to sit up and take notice. But the Court\u2019s decision could affect numerous other laws that Congress has passed. The Framers of our Constitution created the federal courts <a href=\"http://theusconstitution.org/sites/default/files/briefs/Spokeo_v_Robins_CAC.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">to ensure</a> that where there is a legal wrong, there is a place where people can go to get a legal remedy. If individuals can\u2019t sue in court when they\u2019ve been injured by a company\u2019s violation of the law, it hurts not only that individual, but everyone else as well, because it decreases companies\u2019 incentives to comply with the law. The Roberts Court has a bad track <a href=\"http://theusconstitution.org/sites/default/files/briefs/Roberts-at-10-Business.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">record</a> when it comes to consumer rights, often siding with big business over the individual, but in <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/campbell-ewald-company-v-gomez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">two</a> <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/tyson-foods-inc-v-bouaphakeo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">other</a> consumer protection cases this term, the Court upheld the rights of the individual, suggesting that business interests may have finally asked the Court to go too far. Any day now we should find out whether business interests have done the same in <i>Spokeo.</i><i> </i></p><p>Or consider another case that the Court heard in November, <i>Foster </i>v.<i> Chatman</i>. In <i>Foster</i>, the Court is being asked to decide whether prosecutors violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause when they struck all four black prospective jurors from a death penalty case in which a black defendant was charged with killing an elderly white woman. Although every state allows prosecutors to strike a certain number of potential jurors without giving their reasons for doing so, prosecutors cannot dismiss potential jurors because of their race. The Court made this clear 30 years ago in a case called <i>Batson </i>v.<i> Kentucky</i>. In <i>Foster</i>, there\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14-8349-ts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">no question</a> that the prosecutors were motivated by race because the defendant\u2019s lawyers actually obtained the prosecutors\u2019 jury selection notes, which made clear the role that race played in their challenges. Indeed, the discrimination was so blatant that a group of former <i>prosecutors </i>filed a friend-of-the-court <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14-8349_20tsac_20Joseph_20diGenova.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">brief</a> in support of the defendant, arguing that the \u201cevidence of racial discrimination in this case is overwhelming.\u201d At oral argument in <i>Foster</i>, the justices spent a great deal of time discussing certain procedural hurdles that could prevent them from reaching a decision on the merits, but if the Court does reach the merits, this could be an important win for criminal defendants. And coming on the heels of some <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hurst-v-florida/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/montgomery-v-louisiana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wins</a> for criminal defendants earlier in the term, it could be a sign that the Court is willing to take at least some steps to address the continuing and significant inequalities in our criminal justice system.</p><p><i>Foster</i> isn\u2019t the only case still pending at the Court that raises questions about the fairness of our judicial system. In February, the Court heard oral argument in <i>Williams </i>v.<i> Pennsylvania</i>, which asks whether it was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause for then-Chief Justice Ronald Castille of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review a lower court decision concluding that lawyers Castille supervised while Philadelphia district attorney engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by suppressing evidence. This case should be an easy one: It\u2019s a fundamental principle of our justice system, <a href=\"http://theusconstitution.org/sites/default/files/briefs/Williams_v_Pennsylvania_Amicus_Brief_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">recognized</a> by James Madison at the nation\u2019s founding, that \u201c[n]o man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause.\u201d The Supreme Court has previously <a href=\"http://theusconstitution.org/sites/default/files/briefs/Williams_v_Pennsylvania_Amicus_Brief_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">held</a> that the Due Process Clause requires \u201c[a] fair trial in a fair tribunal.\u201d Nonetheless, Castille refused to recuse himself from the case; instead, he voted to reverse the lower court\u2019s grant of relief and wrote a separate opinion in which he excoriated both the defense attorneys and the lower court that granted the relief. The American people\u2019s confidence in our justice system depends on whether they can trust the judges who make up that system. The Court\u2019s decision in <i>Williams</i> should have much to say about that.</p><p>Finally, there\u2019s <i>Puerto Rico </i>v. <i>Franklin California Tax-Free Trust</i>. In this case, the Court is being asked to decide whether Puerto Rico can restructure the debt it owes to its creditors to ensure that local utilities can keep operating. In 1984, Congress (with no explanation) took away from Puerto Rico the right to file for federal bankruptcy protection, a right retained by all 50 state governments. The question in the case is whether that federal bankruptcy law nonetheless prevents Puerto Rico from dealing with its debt issues on its own. At oral argument, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg seemed disturbed by the suggestion that it would, <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-233_g314.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">asking</a>, \u201cWhy would Congress put Puerto Rico in this never-never land?\u201d It may seem like a dry question, but it\u2019s one of incredible importance to Puerto Rico and its residents. As Puerto Rico\u2019s attorney <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-233_g314.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">explained</a> at oral argument, \u201cthis is \u2026 a flesh-and-blood situation in Puerto Rico,\u201d and the Court\u2019s decision will determine \u201c[w]hether people in a village in Puerto Rico will be able to get clean water.\u201d</p><p>The Court will continue issuing opinions at the start of every workweek (and occasionally on other days) through the end of June. There are many cases at the Court that don\u2019t make headlines, but are nonetheless incredibly important. And that means the Court could be issuing some big decisions sooner than you think.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133430/4-big-supreme-court-cases-probably-havent-heard</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133430</guid><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Supreme Court]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Brianne J.

In terms of ISIS\u2019s international strategy, however, the more apt Algerian analogue lies with the Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale (FLN), the nationalist group that secured independence from the country\u2019s French colonial masters in the 1950s and 1960s.</span><span> </span></p><aside id=\"signal-133383\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>By the turn of the twentieth century, the population disparity between European colonial families and native Algerians was vast: Thanks to a population boom, there were 8,500,000 natives versus 1,200,000 Europeans, only half of whom were French. In World War II, thousands of Algerian Muslims fought alongside the French; after a few attempts to encourage assimilation between the Europeans and Algerians were quashed by radicals on both sides, native Algerians were finally granted French citizenship in 1947. In a bid to maintain control of the country, however, the French government subverted the massive Algerian majority through a combination of flagrant voter fraud and the targeted arrests of Algerian politicians.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">The FLN strategy was another example of the cold, implacable logic of modern terror.</aside><p>This repression not only discredited native moderates, but also disillusioned many of their supporters, who would go on to form the bulk of the leadership of the much more radical, much more violent FLN. Upon its founding in November 1954, the group declared war on the French Fourth Republic. The war began in earnest, however, in August of the next year, when FLN terrorists massacred European colonists\u2014men, women, and children\u2014and native moderates alike. It terms of sheer cruelty, the Philippeville Massacre, as it\u2019s known, yields nothing to modern ISIS atrocities, and it set the tone for a conflict replete with savagery on both sides. It would be the template for the rest of the FLN\u2019s actions in their fight against the Fourth Republic. As a French commander said of the conquest of Algeria in 1830, the Algerian War of Independence was \u201cneither a pretty war, nor an amusing war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill the [local governors],\u201d went the orders from one FLN colonel. \u201cTake their children and kill them. Kill all those who pay taxes and those who collect them. Burn the houses of Muslim NCOs away on active service.\u201d Orders from that colonel\u2019s superior, Ahmed Ben Bella\u2014who would, in 1963, become the first president of a free Algeria\u2014read: \u201cLiquidate all personalities who want to play the role of [mediator].\u201d Just as the horrors of ISIS\u2019s terror campaign aren\u2019t random psychopathy, neither was the FLN\u2019s penchant for violence. As Alistair Horne\u2014whose seminal <i>A Savage War of Peace </i>remains the most well-respected work in the contentious historiography of the Algerian War\u2014argues, the FLN strategy was another example of the cold, implacable logic of modern terror.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>In the wake of the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> shootings last January, the Islamic State propaganda magazine <i>Dabiq </i>ran a feature in its seventh issue entitled \u201cThe Extinction of the Grayzone.\u201d The article argues that the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 inaugurated a movement that would split the world into two warring camps: that of Islam, and that of the infidels. In between is the \u201cGrayzone,\u201d comprised of Western moderates and any Muslims deemed insufficiently orthodox. With each new act of violence\u2014and, critically, with each new wave of media coverage\u2014ISIS is attempting to erode moderates into nothingness. Sixty years earlier, the FLN\u2019s own propaganda outlet, <i>El Moudjahid</i>, came up with a similar formulation. It decried both \u201cdeviationists\u201d and French moderates, like Albert Camus, who pleaded for compromise; in the meantime, the FLN regularly massacred whole towns suspected of collaborating with the French government.</p><p>It\u2019s critical to realize, however, the second stage of eliminating the grayzone: forcing governments, because of rampant terrorism, to resort to similar tactics against the terrorists. \u201cA resort to blind terrorism would inevitably provoke the forces of law and order into an equally blind repression,\u201d Horne, the historian, writes, \u201cwhich would lead to a backlash by the hitherto uncommitted, polarize the situation into two extreme camps and make impossible any dialogue of compromise by eradicating the \u2018soft center.\u2019\u201d<span> </span></p><p>In Algeria, the Europeans were more than willing to play their part. For every bombing in an Algiers caf\u00e9 or nightclub, innocent Muslims could expect a brutal mob reaction. The French military and colonial government, too, rapidly descended into what longtime French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand termed the <i>cercle infernale. </i>Hardened by World War II and the fresh loss of Indochina, the military struggled to maintain order in Algeria through a cold-blooded counterterrorism plan. It involved carpet-bombing towns suspected of harboring guerrillas, the construction of electrified fences along the country\u2019s borders adorned with dead animals, and the use of torture.</p><p>By 1959, a year after the fall of the Fourth Republic, it was clear the FLN\u2019s bloody campaign had succeeded. While the French had almost complete military control of the country, they had lost the battle for international support. In the eyes of both foreign observers and left-leaning and moderate French citizens, the French government had abandoned its purportedly noble mission to \u201ccivilize\u201d the native Algerians by stooping to the FLN\u2019s level\u2014and not even these horrific measures had demonstrated that everyday Algerian citizens were safe from the violence.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p><span>The current situation in the West, even amid the Syrian refugee crisis, is a far cry from the nightmare into which Algeria descended.

Last December, an NBC News/<i>Wall Street Journal </i>poll showed that <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/nbc-wsj-poll-57-oppose-trumps-muslim-proposal-n477941\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">only 36 percent of GOP primary voters opposed</a> Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration.

Nor are the politicians using Islamophobia to gain power and influence. As the FLN proved decades ago in Algeria, public anti-Muslim attitudes are<i> part of</i> ISIS\u2019s grand strategy. Creating an atmosphere unsafe for moderates of any kind is how you extinguish the grayzone. That\u2019s why there are no easy answers when it comes to defeating an enemy like ISIS. Reactionary paranoia is part of the enemy strategy, and now that Donald Trump will be the Republican candidate for president in November, it remains to be seen whether Americans will\u2014or can\u2014reject this fear. Coexistence at arm\u2019s length isn\u2019t enough, either, not when <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/03/isis-winning-social-media-war-heres-beat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ISIS\u2019s online influence</a> is so pervasive.</p><p>At the risk of indulging in cozy liberal pieties, maybe the courage of American ideals is enough; maybe we can make the grayzone a home, rather than a strategic consideration. Maybe, with their words and their actions, Americans will put the lie to hatred from ISIS and Islamophobes alike. And maybe, despite the political risks, more politicians will do the same.</p><p>The alternative is fear. The Algerian novelist and teacher Mouloud Feraoun, a pacifist who supported Algerian independence, saw the fear firsthand. He detailed it in heartbreaking, humane fashion in his journal in November 1956, one month after three coordinated bombings kick-started the climactic Battle of Algiers. \u201cEach one of us is guilty for the sole reason that we belong to a category, a race, a people,\u201d Feraoun writes. \u201cYou fear that someone will make you pay with your life for your place in the world, pay for the color of your skin. You fear that someone will attack you only because nobody has done it yet.\u201d</p><p>On March 15, 1962, revanchist French terrorists murdered Feraoun. The French government signed a formal ceasefire three days later.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133383/saving-grayzone</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133383</guid><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Algeria]]></category><category><![CDATA[France]]></category><category><![CDATA[ISIS]]></category><category><![CDATA[Islamophobia]]></category><category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Walt Lewellyn]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/5eac34bcf1ac33ca01982d3f31edd7e9cbae3ecb.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Double Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>At a <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=8623\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1962\nWhite House dinner</a> honoring Nobel Prize winners, President Kennedy\nremarked, \u201cThis is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human\nknowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the\npossible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\u201d The witticism is apt,\nyet we might wonder if Jefferson ever dined alone.

Onuf</a>,\ntwo of the most eminent living Jefferson scholars, take their turn trying to\nanswer the riddle. Their method is to investigate Jefferson from the inside out.\nRather than reviewing the well-known facts of his political and personal life,\nthey explore Jefferson\u2019s sense of himself and his place in the world. And they\nare willing to accept that this self-conception may be a tangled, complicated\none, quoting the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa\u2019s maxim that \u201ceach of us is\nseveral, is many, is a profusion of selves.\u201d</p><p>The key to Jefferson\u2019s paradoxes, they argue, is that\nhe gradually came to see himself as a \u201crepublican patriarch.\u201d He reconciled his\ncommitment to equality with his sense of personal superiority and desire for\ncontrol by dividing life into two spheres, public and private. In the public sphere,\nhe thought of himself as a citizen among equal citizens, while in the home he\nconsidered himself a benevolent patriarch\u2014a home which, in the case of\nMonticello, included not only children, grandchildren, in-laws, and servants,\nbut also several dozen slaves. (It would have included a wife as well, but Martha\nWayles Jefferson died young, and he never remarried.) The title of the book\ncomes from a 1793 letter in which Jefferson says that if his second daughter\nmarries as happily as his first, \u201cI shall imagine myself as blessed as the most\nblessed of the patriarchs.\u201d Unlike the Biblical patriarchs, however, Jefferson\nsought not only to be a benevolent master of his family and their slaves, but also\nto be a citizen, that is, an equal member of a democratic republic.<span>&nbsp;<br></span></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p><i>Most Blessed of the Patriarchs</i>\nis not a biography in the usual sense. It is arranged thematically\nrather than chronologically. Each chapter examines one force\u2014\u201cVirginia,\u201d\n\u201cPolitics,\u201d and \u201cMusic,\u201d for example\u2014that shaped Jefferson\u2019s philosophy of\nlife, and traces how it influenced his self-understanding and his journey from youth\nto old age. Jefferson\u2019s conception of himself as a \u201crepublican patriarch\u201d is\nseen as the center of his unbelievably diverse interests and endeavors. Much of\nthe fascination of the book is that, in a relatively short span, it examines\nJefferson not only as statesman and plantation owner, but also as philosopher,\nscientist, author, musician, inventor, architect, educator, father, and friend.</p><p>Although Gordon-Reed and Onuf look at Jefferson\u2019s life as a\nwhole, the center of gravity in their study is the topic that has perplexed\nobservers since the eighteenth century: Jefferson and slavery. What does it\nmean that the man who drafted the Declaration of Independence, and who came\nvery near to capture and probable execution as wartime governor of Virginia\nfighting for popular sovereignty, was also a slave owner? He was one of the\nmost radical American revolutionaries, yet as Gordon-Reed and Onuf put it,\n\u201cWhat has fascinated (and annoyed) many observers of the man, from his time until\nwell into our own, is that he would dare to launch himself into this role from\nsuch an improbable base of operations: a slave plantation.\u201d<span>&nbsp;</span></p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">He reconciled his\ncommitment to equality with his sense of superiority by dividing life into two spheres, public and private.</aside><p>They seek an answer by examining Jefferson\u2019s evolving\nunderstanding of the institution of slavery, his place in it, and its place in\nthe American republic. They don\u2019t question the sincerity of his oft-repeated conviction\nthat slavery is a \u201cmoral and political depravity,\u201d and a \u201ccruel war against\nhuman nature itself.\u201d Rather, they interpret his relationships with Monticello\nand its slaves in the context of a more-or-less coherent worldview that\nabhorred slavery but was at a loss about how to end it in America. Jefferson\nhoped for a future in which not only the United States but the world would know\nonly free and equal citizens but, as he could not find the path from here to\nthere, he sought, as a \u201crepublican patriarch,\u201d to ameliorate the condition of\nthose in his charge until history turned a page.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Jefferson saw from early on that slavery was incompatible\nwith the principles of the American Revolution. There was the obvious point\nthat slavery violates the ideal of political equality. But Jefferson dug into\nthe psychological effects of slavery on both slave and owner. A chapter of his\nonly book, <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i>, addresses the \u201cunhappy\ninfluence on the manners of our people produced by the existence of slavery\namong us.\u201d He writes:</p><blockquote><p>With what execration should the\nstatesman be loaded, who permitting one half of the citizens thus to trample on\nthe rights of the other, transforms those into despots, and these into enemies,\ndestroys the morals of the one part, and the amor patriae of the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Influenced by the French philosopher Montesquieu, Jefferson\nargued that slavery is incompatible with popular government because it destroys\nthe social and psychological foundation of democratic institutions. Despots on\nthe plantation could not be good citizens in the town meeting; and slaves\nwould, understandably, not be patriots in a state that had legitimated their\noppression.</p><p>But what to do about it? Early in his career Jefferson\noffered a plan for straight emancipation, but his proposal was not given a\nhearing by the Virginia legislature; it was, Gordon-Reed and Onuf write, \u201cquashed\nby opposition forces before it could even be raised.\u201d Forcible abolition was also\nimpossible, because even if the political will had existed, there was no\nfederal army, and no infrastructure, for a military occupation of the plantations.\nIn any case, such a course would have destroyed the union in its infancy. Ultimately,\nJefferson wasn\u2019t sure that former slaves and masters could ever be reconciled,\nyet he saw that expatriation wouldn\u2019t work either, because \u201cone million of\nthese fighting men,\u201d meaning former slaves, \u201cwill say \u2018we will not go.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Neither Jefferson nor anyone in the revolutionary era could conceive\na workable answer. But, in Jefferson\u2019s view, history was on liberty\u2019s side. \u201cNothing,\u201d he\nwrote, \u201cis more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people\nare to be free.\u201d He was, the authors say, \u201ca man who fervently, and some\nmight say naively, believed in the notion of inevitable human progress.\u201d While\nthe details remained inscrutable to him, the outline seemed clear: a gradual\nevolution from a slave economy to a wage economy (including education and\ntraining of slaves to become self-sufficient citizens), and gradual\nenlightenment of the white population to see the moral evil of slavery and its corrosive\neffects on democratic culture. Gordon-Reed and Onuf suggest that we can\nunderstand Jefferson\u2019s relationship to his plantation in terms of his\noptimistic philosophy of history. As unbelievable and perhaps self-deluded as\nit seems to us, Jefferson saw Monticello as a relatively benign institution\nthat was in step with history\u2019s march toward emancipation.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>The authors show that, within limits, Jefferson trained his\nslaves in technical, marketable skills. He let them seek outside work and keep\nthe proceeds of their labor. Very unusually for the time, he paid wages when he\ncould, although this was sporadic because he lived at the mercy of creditors,\nhaving inherited huge debts from his father and father-in-law. He allowed\nslaves to purchase their freedom and, in at least two cases, he simply granted\nit when asked. He almost never purchased slaves himself and, when he did, it\nwas usually to unite families. And so on. Meanwhile, he was busy founding the\nUniversity of Virginia in order to, in his <a href=\"http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch18s33.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">words</a>,\nexpound \u201ca sound spirit of legislation, which, banishing all arbitrary\nand unnecessary restraint on individual action, shall leave us free to do\nwhatever does not violate the equal rights of another.\u201d<span>&nbsp;</span></p><aside class=\"pullquote figure-active pull-left\">No matter how far readers work their way into Jefferson\u2019s\nworldview, however, Monticello still appears saturated in the miseries of\nchattel slavery.</aside><p>No matter how far readers work their way into Jefferson\u2019s\nworldview, however, Monticello still appears saturated in the miseries of\nchattel slavery. Gordon-Reed\u2019s previous work, the Pulitzer Prize and National\nBook Award-winning <a href=\"http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-06477-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>The\nHemingses of Monticello</i></a>, sealed the scholarly consensus that, after his\nwife\u2019s death, Jefferson initiated a decades-long sexual relationship with his\nslave Sally Hemings. <i>Most Blessed Patriarch</i> discusses in detail their\nrelationship, which began when Hemings was only 16 years old, and it follows\nthe lives of their five surviving children, whom Jefferson kept as slaves. Not\nsurprisingly, the slaves who were offered the most opportunity at Monticello were\nJefferson\u2019s own offspring and their cousins. Others worked in the fields dawn\nto dusk, six days per week, in a legal vacuum that left them defenseless\nagainst Jefferson and his overseers. Even though Gordon-Reed and Onuf\nshow that Jefferson was something more interesting and sympathetic than a mere\nhypocrite, we might well judge his efforts at amelioration to be an unworthy\nhalf measure that allowed him to decry slavery while simultaneously benefitting\nfrom it.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>To give only a suggestion of the complex racial and sexual politics\nat Monticello: Sally Hemings was three-quarters European. She was the daughter\nof a half-European slave, Elizabeth Hemings, and her European owner, John\nWayles, who was Jefferson\u2019s father-in-law. Sally Hemings was thus the\nhalf-sister of Jefferson\u2019s deceased wife, and her children with Jefferson were seven-eighths\nEuropean. They were also, it seems, ethnically indistinguishable from their\nfather. Several of them simply lived as whites after they were eventually freed.\nBecause white male owners so frequently treated women slaves as concubines at\nbest and sex slaves at worst, it was not uncommon on Virginia plantations to\nfind slaves who appeared to be white\u2014for slave status followed the mother. Nonetheless,\nat least one guest at Monticello felt disconcerted that the slave serving the dinner\ntable was the spitting image of their host.</p><p>Gordon-Reed\u2019s <i>Hemingses of Monticello</i> caused <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/books/review/Foner-t.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">controversy</a>\nwhen it was published in 2008 because, in addition to making a strong case that\nJefferson fathered Sally Hemings\u2019s children, it sought to enter Hemings\u2019s\nintellectual and emotional world, and it portrayed Monticello as the home of\nthe Hemingses and others slave families as much as it was the home of the\nJeffersons. In short, Gordon-Reed took Hemings\u2019s perspective seriously.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I suspect this new book will cause controversy\nfor the opposite reason: it takes Jefferson\u2019s perspective seriously at a time\nwhen his reputation is at a low in some quarters, especially <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/11/23/thomas-jefferson-next-target-students-who-question-honors-figures-who-were-racists\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">college\ncampuses</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/how-hamilton-recasts-thomas-jefferson-as-a-villain/401669/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Broadway</a>.\nReaders may be unwilling or unable to swallow the potent dram of generosity\nneeded to see the world through a slave owner\u2019s eyes, even one who claimed to\nhate slavery and who wrote some of history\u2019s most influential words of\nliberation. In\ntheir search for understanding rather than for comfortable bromides,\nGordon-Reed and Onuf exemplify a virtue that Jefferson admired, even though, in\nthis case, it does not always tend to his advantage.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133386/thomas-jeffersons-double-life</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133386</guid><category><![CDATA[Books]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Thomas Jefferson]]></category><category><![CDATA[Slavery]]></category><category><![CDATA[History]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matthew C.

It\u2019s slightly different for the famous: If you can imagine it, there\u2019s porn of <i>you</i> doing it. Mia Swier, a television producer and bassist in a punk rock band, has dated Darren Criss, a former star of <i>Glee</i> and a bona fide teen idol, for six years. The couple\u2019s fans call them by a mash-up of their names, <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/miarren\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miarren</a>. Every now and then, Swier\u2019s friends like to forward her fan fiction. A very special kind of fan fiction\u2014erotic stories written by strangers about her and her boyfriend, laced with scraps of information culled from their tweets and Instagram posts. \u201cWe were on a road trip last spring, and one of our friends was doing dramatic readings of them,\u201d said Alli Coates, an artist and Swier\u2019s best friend. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, but so strange,\u201d Swier said. \u201cBeing closely associated with someone in the public eye\u2014which was never something I really wanted or thought I would be\u2014it wasn\u2019t a predicament I thought I would find myself in.\u201d </p><aside id=\"signal-133018\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Miarren fanfic covers the full breadth of human sexual fantasy, from Swier<a href=\"http://jesssir.tumblr.com/post/48277690208/mia-finds-the-engagement-ring-darren-hadnt-hidden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> finding an engagement ring </a>in Criss\u2019s closet (\u201cThe box made her tremble a little, because those blue with a golden rim boxes were only made for one thing\u201d) to a sexy scene in which Criss<a href=\"http://ipwarn.tumblr.com/post/141871097930/mias-need\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> shows photos of himself in costume</a> for <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> (\u201cMia finally tore her eyes from the screen and looked up at Darren, who didn\u2019t even realize he was holding his breath\u201d). Typically, Swier, striking and exuding confidence, is under constant scrutiny as to whether she truly deserves Criss\u2019s undying love. Coates, whose Snapchat and Instagram accounts are dissected for clues about Criss\u2019s life, occasionally appears in the fanfic, too. But she is idolized in part because, as a lesbian, she\u2019s not competition for Criss\u2019s affection. \u201cWhoever is peripherally connected to him,\u201d Coates explained, \u201cthey form opinions of who we are and whether we\u2019re deserving of association with him.\u201d </p><p>Fame is an agreement to be loved by strangers in exchange for being drafted into a narrative someone else controls. These stories, though, are built out of facts\u2014fans want something real they can use as evidence for their own fantasies of celebrities\u2019 lives. In the 1840s, the charismatic performances by pianist Franz Liszt<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/10/22/141617637/how-franz-liszt-became-the-worlds-first-rock-star\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> inspired mobs of young women</a> to fight over shreds of his gloves, handkerchiefs, and even cigar stumps to keep as mementos. A hundred years later, the management of fan frenzy was professionalized as Hollywood studios crafted their stars\u2019 offscreen personas with as much care as their onscreen roles: fake names to suggest rugged masculinity, fake marriages to conceal homosexuality. In 1955, <a href=\"http://thehairpin.com/2011/08/scandals-of-classic-hollywood-rock-hudson-hollywoods-most-eligible-bachelor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Life</i> reported</a>, \u201cFans are urging 29-year-old Rock Hudson to get married\u2014or explain why not.\u201d Actress Loretta Young had to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/arts/television/judy-lewis-secret-daughter-of-hollywood-dies-at-76.html?_r=2&amp;hpw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pretend to adopt her own daughter</a> in order to protect the career of the father, Clark Gable. But despite these invented fictions, the banalities of stars\u2019 real lives still held sway over fans. Starline Tours <a href=\"http://www.starlinetours.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">began taking sightseers to movie stars\u2019 homes</a> in 1935. There is almost nothing to see on these tours, because the more famous the person, the <a href=\"http://www.laweekly.com/arts/i-had-zero-interest-in-celebrity-home-toursuntil-i-went-on-one-2373586\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">further back from the street her home sits</a>. </p><p>Social media takes the plebs behind the wall. Even better than getting into a celebrity\u2019s house, they can get into their brains through their phones. The flood of famous trivia\u2014favorite smoothies, waist-cinchers, bathroom d\u00e9cor, best friends\u2014has spawned fandoms that act like amateur detectives. Think <i>CSI: Instagram</i>. But while social media seems like a mirrored window that lets us glimpse famous lives, it\u2019s two-way. Celebrities can peer back into the minds of their fans, who, thanks to those very same platforms, are curating their own public personas as carefully as studio publicists of the past. Social media is a prism that fame passes through, refracting in unpredictable ways.</p><p>Excess fame has beamed off Criss and Swier to a friend of mine, Matt Glueckert\u2014and then to me. Glueckert, who met Swier through friends in the music business, was the subject of fleeting fan interest in 2012 after he was tagged with Swier in a beach photo posted on Twitter. Swier looked happy in it, and fans noticed: <i>Could it mean she was actually</i> <i>with Glueckert and not their heartthrob? </i>(No.) Glueckert thought the attention was fun, until the novelty wore off. Last fall, Glueckert invited me to a Halloween party that Criss and Swier also attended. On Instagram, I lovingly documented the pumpkin I\u2019d carved and, without realizing it, captured a blurry but recognizable Criss in the background. In a big group photo Glueckert posted, I was tagged with them; my head is only 24 pixels wide and half\u2014covered by a stupid red hat. Within hours, three Criss fan accounts were following me. They have since abandoned my otherwise Crissless feed, but the event has been canonized by Miarren historians who have entered these photos into a Tumblr <a href=\"http://miarrenandchrisneyland.tumblr.com/post/80457931718/miarren-masterpost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cmiarren masterpost\u201d</a>: \u201cDarren and Mia attend friends\u2019 pumpkin party,\u201d with our photos as evidence.</p><p><span>Instagram is a branding platform, and my Instagram exists to advertise to people I don\u2019t see all that often that I am a super-fun person who does weird, cool stuff all the time. So to be tagged with famous people\u2014and then have fans of those famous people meticulously document the photos\u2014was basically my greatest possible Instagram triumph. I sent a link to the photo to my status-conscious friends: \u201cPlz acknowledge my fame.\u201d \u201cSo proud of you,\u201d one replied. \u201cFucking finally,\u201d I said, and meant it.</span></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>There is a constant referendum on social media on whether the famous deserve their fame. Swier originally got on Twitter to promote her band; she loves being able to talk to people all over the world about her music. But she\u2019s careful not to put out personal information. She keeps her Instagram private. She stays off Tumblr, which, as home to much of the Criss fan fiction, is for her \u201ca very scary and angry place.\u201d </p><p>Much of the hate Swier gets is from <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/crisscolfer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">CrissColfer shippers</a>.

In one she filmed in 2013 called <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXn1xavynj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Reflexxx</a>, </i>performance artist Signe Pierce walks down the main drag of Myrtle Beach while wearing a short, tight blue dress, stripper heels, and a smooth mirrored mask. It\u2019s night, and people are out on the street, acting a little tipsy. As Pierce walks wordlessly, sometimes posing, Coates follows with the camera, and men catcall: \u201cI would love to make love to you with that on.\u201d People gawk and point, and the crowd reacts as much to the camera as to Pierce. They want to document the scene\u2014\u201cI\u2019m putting this on Instagram!\u201d\u2014but they also resent her. Women shout that Pierce is really a man. Someone throws water on her. As the crowd swells, it gets angrier, and violent. Teen girls throw bottles, then try to trip her, and she\u2019s violently shoved to the ground, her shoes flying into the street. Who pushed her? An appalled teen boy says, \u201cSome grown-ass woman.\u201d Internalized sexism is sometimes expressed externally. Pierce lies on the ground bleeding while people circle her and stare. </p><p>Why did the mob get so angry? The mask probably made it seem like Pierce wasn\u2019t a person. But, Coates said, \u201cI think other people were also getting angry that she was getting attention\u2014this weird micro-fame she\u2019d gained in only ten or 15 minutes. It was upsetting people, they were following her around. It was this small experiment that reflects a lot of what happens in entertainment culture.\u201d The mob had elevated the girl in the mirror mask to a sensation, but when she wouldn\u2019t play along, they turned on her, decided she was a fraud, undeserving of adulation, and that she needed to be literally knocked off her high heels. In the last few minutes of the film, Pierce stands up, bleeding, holding her shoes. The spell is broken, she is a real person. As she lunges toward the crowd, people run away. </p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133018/fame-people</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133018</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[June 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Columns]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><category><![CDATA[-homepage-lower]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Elspeth Reeve]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/4100794af036fb08ee41e4f36e156045477f5026.tiff\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 10 Movies We Can\u2019t Wait to See at Cannes This Year   ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Kicking off on Wednesday, the 69th Cannes Film Festival looks to be as stacked with potential gems as any edition in recent memory. Of the 21 films in competition for the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or, which has gone in recent years to <i>Blue Is the Warmest Color</i> and <i>The Tree of Life, </i>three are from directors who have already won the prize at least once\u2014and that\u2019s to say nothing of returning festival favorites like Nicolas Winding Refn, Pedro Almod\u00f3var, and Park Chan-wook.</p><aside id=\"signal-133394\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Cannes is more than its competition slate, of course\u2014the festival\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/selection/un-certain-regard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Un Certain Regard</a> and the parallel sections Directors\u2019 Fortnight and Critics\u2019 Week will contain some treats as well\u2014but the Palme contenders dominated my choice for the movies I\u2019m most excited to see. Narrowing it down to ten films wasn\u2019t easy, but since we already spotlighted <i>The BFG</i>, <i>Caf\u00e9 Society</i>, <i>The Neon Demon,</i> and <i>The Nice Guys </i>in our <a href=\"/article/133086/15-movies-youll-want-see-summer\">summer movie preview</a>, I decided to skip over those and focus instead on films that may not ring a bell yet. </p><h2><b><i>American Honey </i></b></h2><p>A movie about teens wandering across America in pursuit of adventure and escape might seem pedestrian. But when English filmmaker Andrea Arnold is behind the camera, my curiosity is piqued. The director of <i>Red Road</i> and <i>Fish Tank</i>, who won a Best Live Action Short Film Oscar for 2003\u2019s <i>Wasp</i>, Arnold has assembled a cast that includes Sasha Lane, critical lightning-rod Shia LaBeouf, and Riley Keough, who has been flat-out phenomenal on Starz\u2019s <i>The Girlfriend Experience</i>. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/09/profile_of_the_independent_film_distributor_a24_the_company_behind_spring.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">A24</a>\u2014the smart studio behind <i>Spring Breakers</i>, <i>Room,</i> and <i>Ex Machina</i>\u2014plans on releasing <i>American Honey </i>in the second half of this year, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/a24-picks-up-teen-drama-857352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">billing the film</a> as \u201cboth an intimate coming-of-age story and a look at an American generation not playing by the rules.\u201d Arnold\u2019s movies have always observed outsiders with a compassionate, incisive specificity, so I\u2019m hopeful that this film will transcend that potentially eye-rolling plot description.</p><h2><b><i>Elle </i></b></h2><p>It\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s more amazing: that <i>Elle </i>is director Paul Verhoeven\u2019s first film since 2006\u2019s <i>Black Book</i>; or that the last time he competed for the Palme d\u2019Or, it was with <i>Basic Instinct</i>. The competition doesn\u2019t usually make room for straight-up genre fare, but the festival makes exceptions for this man, who\u2019s back with the tale of a business executive (played by two-time Cannes Best Actress winner Isabelle Huppert) who tries to track down the assailant who attacked her at home. <i>Elle</i> sounds juicy, thrilling, kinky, and strange\u2014which is to say, it sounds like a Verhoeven movie.</p><h2><b><i>Graduation </i></b></h2><p>Cristian Mungiu is one of two major Romanian filmmakers in this year\u2019s competition (we\u2019ll get to the second shortly), and his latest reportedly draws from his experience of becoming a parent. <i>Graduation</i> stars Adrian Titieni as a small-town doctor, and Mungiu has <a href=\"http://www.screendaily.com/news/cristian-mungiu-reveals-first-details-of-next-film/5084189.article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a> that the film is \u201cabout compromise, parenting and children, and understanding this relationship between what you say to your children and what they see you doing.\u201d Mungiu won the Palme d\u2019Or in 2007 for <i>4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days</i>, and his follow-up film, 2012\u2019s <i>Beyond the Hills</i>, won Best Screenplay and Best Actress at the festival. Sundance Selects has already picked up the U.S. distribution rights for <i>Graduation</i>, so expectations will be high.</p><h2><b><i>Loving </i></b></h2><p><i>Take Shelter </i>filmmaker Jeff Nichols has already had one winner this year with <a href=\"/article/131723/midnight-special-close-encounters-new-kind\"><i>Midnight Special</i></a>, and he hopes to continue his hot streak with this true-life drama about an interracial couple (Joel Edgerton, Ruth Negga) whose marriage in the late 1950s lands them in prison. Focus Features has slated <i>Loving</i> for a November release, positioning the film as a serious awards contender. Launching at Cannes could be the ideal way to kick-start the film\u2019s Oscar campaign, and the festival clearly has a soft spot for Nichols: His 2012 drama <i>Mud</i> premiered in the competition, just like <i>Loving </i>will.</p><h2><b><i>Paterson </i></b></h2><p>Adam Driver is now best known for playing the emo Kylo Ren in <i>The Force Awakens</i>, but he\u2019s been doing great work in everything from <i>Girls </i>to <i>While We\u2019re Young </i>to <i>Midnight Special</i>. Now, he stars in director Jim Jarmusch\u2019s latest, about a bus driver living a quiet life in New Jersey. Jarmusch and Driver both had movies in competition at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival\u2014the filmmaker screened <i>Only Lovers Left Alive</i>, while Driver was part of the ensemble of <i>Inside Llewyn Davis</i>\u2014and although <i>Paterson</i>\u2019s modesty doesn\u2019t make it a Palme d\u2019Or frontrunner, it could be the sort of quiet charmer that garners plenty of buzz. (If you want something a little louder, Jarmusch will also be presenting his Stooges documentary, <i>Gimme Danger</i>, in the festival\u2019s Midnight Screenings section.)<span></span></p><h2><b><i>Personal Shopper </i></b></h2><p>In 2016, there\u2019s no longer any reason to be shocked that critics like Kristen Stewart or surprised that she\u2019s taken seriously as an actor. Now years removed from <i>Twilight</i>,<i> </i>she won a Best Supporting Actress C\u00e9sar last year for her work in <i>Clouds of Sils Maria</i>, becoming the first American actress to ever do so. Now she has reunited with that movie\u2019s writer-director, Olivier Assayas, for <i>Personal Shopper</i>, which has been described as a ghost story set amidst the world of Paris fashion. Assayas\u2019s latest also features two actors who have worked with him in the past, Lars Eidinger and Nora von Waldst\u00e4tten, and <i>Personal Shopper</i> will be his fifth film to compete for the Palme d\u2019Or. But for many, Stewart will be the draw\u2014and she might have a memorable Cannes between this film and festival opener <i>Caf\u00e9 Society</i>.</p><h2><b><i>The Salesman</i></b></h2><p>Every year at Cannes, after the competition is announced, one or two last-minute additions will be accepted a week or so later, the festival essentially holding slots for movies that are rushing to be completed. This year, one such film is the latest from Iranian writer-director Asghar Farhadi, who has recently established himself as a significant international filmmaker. His 2011 divorce drama <i>A Separation </i>won Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars, and 2013\u2019s <i>The Past</i> took home Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival for B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo. (Adding to his reputation, his 2009 missing-person drama <i>About Elly</i> finally got a proper U.S. release last year, earning stellar reviews, and his 2006 film <i>Fireworks Wednesday</i> hit American theaters in March.) Not a lot is known about <i>The Salesman</i>\u2014it\u2019s either the story of a couple going through difficulties while on a tour of <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, or a tale of an apartment with a troubled history\u2014but Farhadi\u2019s precise observations about human frailty will probably be front and center as usual. <i> <br></i></p><h2><b><i>Sieranevada </i></b></h2><p>The Romanian New Wave sounded its first major depth charge when <i>The Death of Mr. Lazarescu </i>screened at Cannes in 2005 as part of the festival\u2019s Un Certain Regard, winning that section\u2019s top prize. The filmmaker was Cristi Puiu, who is now back with <i>Sieranevada</i>, which sounds <i>Lazarescu</i>-like in its dramatization of an event that never quite takes place. Chronicling a successful doctor who\u2019s attending a family reunion that will honor his father, who died a year earlier, <i>Sieranevada</i> is, <a href=\"http://www.filmneweurope.com/news/romania-news/item/110008-production-cristi-puiu-shooting-sierra-nevada\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to Puiu</a>, \u201ca story about those who choose to escape into fiction and hide their fears behind \u2018concrete reality\u2019 when overwhelmed by a grief they cannot understand.\u201d Considering how darkly humorous <i>Lazarescu </i>was, there\u2019s more than a possibility Puiu will find the black comedy in this bleak scenario as well.</p><h2><b><i>Toni Erdmann</i></b></h2><p>2009\u2019s <i>Everyone Else</i> is one of the best recent romantic dramas, ably dissecting that delicate moment during a new relationship when you and your lover decide to go on vacation together and everything falls apart. German writer-director Maren Ade hasn\u2019t made a film since, which is why it\u2019s so cheering that she\u2019s returned with <i>Toni Erdmann</i>. That said, the vague plot description makes it very hard to know what kind of movie awaits us: It stars veteran actor Peter Simonischek as a father who decides to visit his distant adult daughter (Sandra Huller), determined to shake her out of a funk by unleashing a bunch of jokes. Is this a twisted dark comedy? A despairing drama? A little of both? After <i>Everyone Else</i>, Ade has as much leeway as she desires.</p><h2><b><i>The Unknown Girl </i></b></h2><p>If Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne have a new movie, you can bet it\u2019ll unveil at Cannes. Their last six films screened there\u2014two of them (<i>Rosetta </i>and <i>L\u2019Enfant</i>) won the Palme d\u2019Or\u2014and they\u2019re back on the Croisette with their latest, which concerns a doctor (Ad\u00e8le Haenel) trying to determine the identity of a young woman who died after <span>she refused to have necessary surgery. Haenel is a relative unknown in the States, although she\u2019s won France\u2019s C\u00e9sar Award for her performances in </span><i>Suzanne</i><span> and </span><i>Love at First Fight</i><span>. But the chief selling point with any of the Dardennes\u2019 movies is always the directors themselves, whose previous film, </span><i>Two Days, One Night</i><span>, starred Marion Cotillard. Nobody comes close to their specific brand of stripped-down human dramas.</span></p><p><i>Looking for more movie recommendations?

Although there\u2019s no mystery at this point about who will win the Republican and Democratic presidential nominations, the state\u2019s primary has offered a preview of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\u2019s coming general-election battle for white, working-class voters who are worried about the struggles of coal and other industries\u2014a bloc that\u2019ll be key in competitive general-election battlegrounds like Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. The West Virginia primary is a gauge of whether Clinton can promote strong environmental measures without losing too much support from voters and unions who see those regulations as \u201cjob-killing.\u201d And it hasn\u2019t gone well. <span></span></p><aside id=\"signal-133391\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>On the trail in West Virginia, Clinton has faced fire for her tone-deaf (but decontextualized) <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/05/03/476485650/fact-check-hillary-clinton-and-coal-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">comment at a March CNN forum</a>, when she promised to \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d In the same breath, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIXqxpQNt0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">uttered </a>her promises to bring new economic opportunity to the area and \u201cto make clear that we don\u2019t want to forget those people,\u201d but Republicans and industry seized on her \u201cout of business\u201d remark and ran with it. Clinton\u2019s now-infamous comment led to a confrontation last week with a recently out-of-work coal miner who referenced it and <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/hillary-clinton-apologizes-coal-country-over-out-business-comments-n566451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a> the candidate had a lot of gall to \u201ccome in here and tell us how you\u2019re going to be our friend.\u201d Clinton called her comment a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/hillary-clinton-apologizes-coal-country-over-out-business-comments-n566451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">misstatement</a>\u201d and apologized, trying again to make her point: \u201cWhat I said was totally out of context from what I meant because I have been talking about helping coal country for a very long time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I was saying is that the way things are going now, we will continue to lose jobs.

In that same period, jobs in renewable energy technologies grew by 175,000. But few of those jobs moved into the areas depressed by coal\u2019s fall. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/04/13/peabody-energy-coal-chapter-11-bankruptcy/82971246/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">This year alone</a>, at least <a href=\"/minutes/127434/huge-coal-company-filed-bankruptcy-today-another-shovel-dirt-covered-industrys-casket\">five large coal and energy companies</a> with footholds in the West Virginia economy <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/01/11/3737929/arch-coal-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">have declared bankruptcy</a>. </p><p>Those numbers have only accelerated rising tensions between anti-coal environmentalists and those who\u2019ve long depended on the industry for their livelihoods. Those tensions explain why Clinton, who skated to a <a href=\"http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/results/states/WV.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">41 percent victory</a> over Barack Obama in the 2008 West Virginia primary, is struggling so much this year\u2014<a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/05/trump-sanders-lead-in-west-virginia.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">trailing Bernie Sanders</a> in the Democratic primary, and being <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_WV_50316.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">trounced by Trump</a> in the state\u2019s general-election polls.<span> </span></p><p>Trump has been greeted euphorically in West Virginia because he\u2019s saying what everyone in the economically devastated region wants to hear. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put the miners back to work,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/2016/05/09/world/west-virginia-coal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vowed in Charleston last week. </a>He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxzraR2R31g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">donned a hard hat</a>, promised to revisit the environmental policies that have contributed to the coal industry\u2019s decline, and told 13,000 West Virginians he would make the state \u201cbetter than ever before,\u201d as fans waved \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/05/07/coal-miners-struggle-reinvent-themselves/Wyl9rO3NGsMqV7cGuGdp2M/story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TRUMP DIGS COAL</a>\u201d signs. Of course, he was quick to take advantage of Clinton\u2019s travails: \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m going to put the miners and the mines out of business.\u2019 And then she comes over and she tried to explain her statement. That is a tough one to explain. Wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>Clinton, by contrast, is being punished in West Virginia for her pragmatism about coal\u2019s dim future. The politics are tricky: She wants to keep environmentalists\u2014still skeptical of her devotion to their cause\u2014happy by saying she\u2019ll build on Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan and other regulatory initiatives. But she knows those policies could hurt her (and other Democrats) with white working-class voters like the ones who dominate in West Virginia\u2014and with labor groups like the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/07/united-mine-workers-epa-emissions_n_5948344.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">powerful United Mine Workers of America</a>, which has been <a href=\"http://www.umwa.org/index.php?q=news/umwa-statement-obama-administration%E2%80%99s-mountaintop-removal-announcement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sharply critical of Obama\u2019s environmental policies</a> after endorsing him in the past. </p><p>In November, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/11/12/clinton-plan-to-revitalize-coal-communities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduced a plan</a> that tried to strike a balance between environmental and job concerns. While it was careful to praise coal workers\u2019 contributions to the U.S. economy, the plan didn\u2019t mince words in bringing up a big \u201cbut\u201d: \u201cBut today we are in the midst of a global energy transition.\u201d To help miners and coal communities through that transition, Clinton proposed $30 billion for economic diversification, local school funding, job training, and other programs. Her plan addressed not only the upheaval created by a rising number of coal companies falling into bankruptcy, but also the economic, educational, and health ramifications of <a href=\"/article/131738/game-coal\">coal\u2019s decline</a>. </p><p>Coal Country did not take kindly to this. National Mining Association spokesman Luke Popovich <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-aid-coal-communities-215789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">told Politico</a> Clinton\u2019s proposal was \u201cmade-for-campaign rhetoric,\u201d and compared her policies to those of the Obama administration which \u201chas systematically eviscerated\u201d the coal industry. Ed Yankovich, a district vice president of the United Mine Workers, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-aid-coal-communities-215789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a> folks in coal communities felt abandoned by the Obama administration and were wary of Clinton\u2019s continuation of his policies.</p><p>While Clinton has been assailed in West Virginia, Sanders has been able to glide by on his <a href=\"/article/130518/bernie-crushing-hillary-coal-country\">union-friendly image</a> and populist rhetoric while still <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/people-before-polluters/accelerate-a-just-transition-away-from-fossil-fuels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">denouncing the use of fossil fuels</a>. In polling averages, he <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/wv/west_virginia_democratic_presidential_primary-5425.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">leads Clinton by six points</a>. But Sanders\u2019s actual proposals for coal country are similar to Clinton\u2019s. In December, the Vermont senator <a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/sanders-introduces-major-clean-energy-jobs-package\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduced legislation</a><b> </b>that would allocate $41 billion to transition coal workers into new industries and rebuild communities dependent on the fossil fuel industry. (The bill has been exiled to committee, and Govtrack <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s2391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">gives it a 1 percent chance</a> of being enacted.) </p><p>His proposal might not win any more hearts in West Virginia than Clinton\u2019s, but Sanders has framed his message more appealingly: \u201cWhat the scientists tell us in a very clear way, no ambiguity, is that we have a short window of opportunity to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebaNsfiBc9g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said at a May 5 rally</a> in Morgantown. \u201cNow I know and you know that as we transform our energy system there are people who will be hurt in that transformation.

But a win or an unexpectedly strong showing, given the hostility among so many West Virginians to her $30 billion plan and her fealty to Obama, would be a sign that Clinton is making some headway in her attempt to speak hard truths to working-class voters who\u2019d rather hear big, vague promises. On the other hand, a resounding defeat would mean that Clinton\u2019s pitch to promote both environmentalism and jobs still needs some serious refinement. </span><br></p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133391/hillary-clinton-cant-win-coal-country</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133391</guid><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Climate]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bernie Sanders]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><category><![CDATA[Coal]]></category><category><![CDATA[West Virginia]]></category><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category><category><![CDATA[Democratic Primary 2016]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Emma Foehringer Merchant]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/5c0e8e6f72fa14bff46e13595bcd08b5cada5aef.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Sooner Bernie Sanders Ends His Campaign, the Better]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Hillary Clinton needs to win just <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-only-needs-17-percent-of-remaining-delegates-to-clinch-nomination/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">17 percent</a> of the remaining uncommitted delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination. At this point, arguments about Bernie Sanders\u2019s platform, his movement, or his purported electability are irrelevant; he will not be the Democratic nominee for president. Sanders must know this, but he has declared he will contest Clinton\u2019s nomination up to the party\u2019s nominating convention in July.</p><aside id=\"signal-133397\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>It is Sanders\u2019s prerogative to remain in the race. But exercising that prerogative makes it easier for mega-wealthy conservatives to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to lethally bludgeon both Clinton\u2019s candidacy and the progressive agenda to which Sanders has devoted his career. This is not solely about combating the grave threat of a Donald Trump presidency. It is also about the potential of a Democratic landslide and the progressive achievements that could follow, which is an opportunity too rare and precious to squander. The best way for Sanders to advance the progressive cause is to end his campaign and unabashedly ask his supporters to join him in helping to elect Hillary Clinton. </p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\"><p>This is about the potential of a Democratic landslide and the progressive achievements that could follow, which is an opportunity too rare and precious to squander. </p></aside><p>Sanders has earned the support of millions of Democrats, and the respect of even many ardent Clinton supporters. He has drawn attention to inequality, and to the economic and political influence of Wall Street. He has broadened the political debate and expanded the Democratic Party\u2019s horizons. None of this will change if he steps aside now. On the flip side, what would Sanders gain by dragging out the nomination? Many Democrats are eager to wrap up the intra-party debate and take the fight to Trump. He\u2019s in an optimal position to win concessions from Democrats, and will lose leverage as the nomination drags on.</p><p>Sanders supporters, resisting calls for him to end his campaign, point out Clinton did not end her 2008 campaign against Barack Obama until June. For what it\u2019s worth, Clinton should not have stayed in the race that long. But the Clinton campaign did at least have a rationale for hanging around. Michigan and Florida had flouted the Democratic National Committee\u2019s nominating schedule, and their delegates were not allocated until the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2008/05/dnc-meeting-obama-rules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">DNC rules committee</a> met in the last week of May. Had Clinton won a more favorable distribution of those delegates, she would have been within 100 pledged delegates of Obama, giving her hope for a miracle at the convention. Instead, a week after the DNC\u2019s meeting, she ended her campaign. Sanders has no potential delegate windfalls awaiting him. The trajectory of the race is set, and Clinton will win on the first ballot.</p><p>Sanders supporters also claim that the extended nomination fight in 2008 laid the foundation for Obama\u2019s massive field efforts that fall. That may have been true in some states in 2008, but none of the states remaining this year will be competitive in a close race. Besides, Sanders is not spending his money on field organizing, but on television ads in safely Democratic California. Sanders\u2019s campaign can no longer be seen as an investment toward a Clinton victory in November. </p><p>But the biggest difference between 2008 and 2016, what makes it urgent that Sanders drop out now, is the effect of what Sanders considers one of the biggest blights on American democracy: the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 <i>Citizens United</i> decision.</p><p>In 2008 Clinton and Obama were both personally raising more money than John McCain. It was feasible that, financially speaking, Democrats would have at least parity with the Republicans. There were tighter restrictions back then on how corporations and wealthy individuals could spend money on elections. Excluding spending by party committees (e.g., the National Republican Senatorial Committee), spending in federal elections by outside groups was about $350 million in 2008.</p><p>In 2012, after <i>Citizens United</i>, outside spending jumped to <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/cycle_tots.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1 billion</a>. Super PACs and other groups that use \u201c<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/toc/2012/01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dark money</a>\u201d now fund not only TV and radio ads, but also candidate and issue research, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/upshot/the-special-powers-of-super-pacs-and-not-just-for-federal-elections.html?ref=politics&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">campaign infrastructure</a>, fundraising, legal work, and other activities that benefit candidates. Super PACs allied with Republicans have spent far more money in federal races than those allied with Democrats. The GOP\u2019s advantages in state elections are harder to track and quantify, but their state-level edge is probably far greater. The Koch brothers\u2014whose political operation is a complex network of organizations that has become a second party apparatus for the GOP\u2014raised over <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/01/06/3121881/400-million-kochs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$400 million in 2012</a>, and have pledged to spend nearly <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/koch-2016-spending-goal-114604\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$900 million in 2016</a>, even if they are so far reluctant to spend that money directly on Trump. Liberals do not come close to matching this kind of spending.</p><p>Despite their financial advantage, Republicans are in trouble. Trump is a deeply flawed candidate currently polling well behind Clinton. With the decline of ticket-splitting, a big loss by Trump will result in more Republican losses down the ballot.</p><p>Democrats should be ready to dig in if it turns out to be a tough fight with Trump. But they should not do anything now that might limit the scope of their victories if the presidential race becomes a rout. Obama won in 2012 by four points; if Clinton matches that, Democrats will probably regain control of the Senate. Because of gerrymandering a four-point Clinton win would not deliver Democrats the House, but a ten-point win\u2014which would partly rely on lower turnout by demoralized Republicans\u2014might cause such Republican carnage that Democrats could seize full control of Congress.</p><p>A Clinton landslide would reverberate even further down the ballot. Republican governors and legislators have blocked the Medicaid expansion, imposed regressive taxes, cut funding for education, attacked unions, obstructed efforts to deal with climate change, and led revanchist attacks on voting, LGBTQ, and reproductive rights\u2014all key issues for Sanders. Flipping control of state governments could help stop agendas being advanced by the Kochs and social conservatives at the state level. It may even open up possibilities to implement the progressive policies Sanders holds dear.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>In 2012, while Mitt Romney and the other Republican candidates were expending resources to bash each other, Obama\u2019s campaign methodically laid the foundation of a massive voter persuasion and get-out-the-vote effort. This required money and time, of course, but also the cooperation of the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic Party organizations, which only comes once a candidate is accepted as the presumptive nominee.<span> </span></p><p>Republicans have already capitulated to Trump, which means Democrats will not have the head-start that Obama had in 2012. Furthermore, until Sanders concedes, Democrats cannot fully start running what are known as \u201ccoordinated campaigns.\u201d The national and state party committees and individual campaigns set up these legal and political structures to foster communications, pool resources, prevent duplication, and achieve economies of scale. The result is more efficient and effective canvassing, phone banks, mail, and other forms of voter contact that help Democrats. The sooner coordinated campaigns are fully staffed and operational, the more contests Democrats will win for Senate, the House, state legislatures, and important positions like state attorney general.</p><p>Clinton\u2019s campaign has begun pivoting to a campaign against Trump, but she is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-guam-222847\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">still spending</a> existing resources on the Democratic primary. Furthermore, Sanders is delaying and possibly diminishing the windfall of donations that she will receive after he concedes, from his supporters as well as other Democrats eager to unify the party. Prolonging the nomination fight will keep some large donors from maximizing their potential contribution. It will also limit her small-donor support, since many donors pledge modest amounts per month. Fewer months with a presumptive nominee will mean fewer small monthly contributions. Less money results in less grassroots organizing, which results in fewer votes for Democrats all down the ballot.</p><p>James Carville is fond of the phrase \u201cwhen your opponent is drowning, throw the son of a bitch an anvil.\u201d Those urging Sanders to remain in the race to \u201csustain the movement\u201d or \u201cchange the Democratic Party\u201d must come to terms with the fact that they\u2019re jeopardizing a golden opportunity to do just that to the Republican Party.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133397/sooner-bernie-sanders-ends-campaign-better</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133397</guid><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bernie Sanders]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><category><![CDATA[Democratic Primary 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Barack Obama]]></category><category><![CDATA[Koch Brothers]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dana Houle]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/78f9b23005f4c3cf57a70bed1a14af622326147b.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cruel Intentions]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In the opening swath of the last century, if a writer was luckless enough to arouse the disapproval of <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/dh-lawrence-17175776\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">D.H. Lawrence</a>, he could usually expect a poison-pen letter of soul-stomping vitriol. Trenchantly idealistic about literature\u2014is there any other way to be for the artist and critic?\u2014Lawrence had a talent for combining a maximum of good taste with a minimum of good tact.

The article you send me is a plausible lie, and I hate it. If it says some true things, that is not the point. The fact is that you, in the Essay, are all the time a lie.\u201d It gets worse from there:</p><blockquote><p>I would rather have the German soldiers with their rapine and cruelty, than you with your words of goodness. It is the falsity I can\u2019t bear. I wouldn\u2019t care if you were six times a murderer, so long as you said to yourself, \u201cI am this.\u201d The enemy of all mankind, you are, full of the lust of enmity. It is not the hatred of falsehood which inspires you. It is the hatred of people, of flesh and blood. It is a perverted, mental blood-lust. Why don\u2019t you own it.<span> <br></span></p></blockquote><p>\u201cMisanthropist\u201d was a boomerang Lawrence probably should have kept holstered. His collected letters make clear that he cared for ideas and art far more than he cared for people: \u201cI am so weary of mankind,\u201d he wrote to <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/E-M-Forster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">E.M. Forster </a>in 1916. In person, Lawrence could be as churlish and base as any bitter genius, but his particular appetite for insult seems to have been activated around stationery. There\u2019s a whole continent between what you will say in person and what you will say on paper. The above targets were Lawrence\u2019s <i>friends</i>, so just imagine the letter you got\u2014the missive as missile\u2014if you were his foe. He ends the note to Russell: \u201cLet us become strangers again. I think it is better.\u201d<span> </span></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Literary ethos has always thrived on such writer-to-writer invective, especially in Britain, where <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/alexander-pope\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alexander Pope</a> could ruin you with a couplet. When the criminally overrated novelist <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugh-Seymour-Walpole\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hugh Walpole</a> sent <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Rebecca-West\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rebecca West </a>a self-pitying letter complaining about West\u2019s treatment of him in the papers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/11/theatre-lakedistrict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">she replied</a> with typically Westian bite: \u201cI don\u2019t like your work; I think it facile and without artistic impulse,\u201d and then dished him a much-needed lesson on \u201cthe duty of a critic to point out the fallaciousness of the method and vision of a writer who was being swallowed whole by the British public, as you are!\u201d </p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\"><p>Many will nix the \u201cDear\u201d\u2014you are not dear to them\u2014and<br> begin only with the clerical thud of your full name. </p></aside><p>With the <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/education/GMR2006/full/chapt8_eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">spread of mass literacy</a> in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, that public began scribbling to authors as never before. If you had to guess which nineteenth-century author received the most mail, guess <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/charles-dickens-9274087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charles Dickens</a>. In November of 1840, as <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i> was being serialized, he groaned: \u201cI am inundated with imploring letters recommending poor little Nell to mercy.\u201d Dickens\u2019s ferocious popularity coincided not only with rising literacy rates but with the <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/history/pennypos.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uniform Penny Post</a>, the overhaul to the Royal Mail that allotted cheap postal access to the British public. You can imagine the aching back of Dickens\u2019s mailman, and you can imagine that where there\u2019s fan mail, there\u2019s hate mail. Dickens destroyed almost all of the letters he received from readers, but <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/mark-twain-9512564\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark Twain </a>didn\u2019t, and in <i><a href=\"http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520261341\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dear Mark Twain: Letters From His Readers</a></i>, you\u2019ll see the baffling goulash of mail people felt compelled to send him. As the foreword has it, these missives came from \u201cfarmers, schoolteachers, and schoolchildren, businessmen, preachers, customs agents, inmates of mental institutions, con artists, dreamers of various sorts, and at least one former president,\u201d all of them witness to the first American movement of mass education, the first time in history the nation had a mass readership. </p><p>They asked Twain for autographs, for advice, for aid in publishing their own work; they begged for money; they offered approbation and they offered scorn. From one gentleman in 1880: \u201cWhat I want to know is by what rule a fellow can infallibly judge when you are lying and when you are telling the truth. I write this in case you intend to afflict an innocent and unoffending public with any more such works.\u201d From an Ohioan in 1885: \u201cDear Sir: For Gods sake give a suffering public a rest on your labored wit.\u2014Shoot your trash &amp; quit it.\u2014You are only an <i>imitator</i> of Artemas Ward &amp; a sickening one at that &amp; we are <i>all sick of you</i>, For Gods sake take a tumble &amp; give U.S. a rest.\u201d (That\u2019s Artemus Ward the humorist and irreverent lecturer, nom de plume of Charles Farrar Browne.) You can almost feel the cozy glow of smugness in those lines, their self-satisfied warmth, the underlining current of <i>What makes you so special? </i>Every hate mailer is charmlessly convinced he knows best, certain his standards beat the author\u2019s. That Ohioan obviously got a good deal of pleasure from unloading on Mark Twain, and that seems to be nine-tenths of the reason people bother to send hate mail: It cheers them up.</p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/6cc460d0bb47b74f729235acc752b1dec719a62c.jpeg?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;c7a47215-a394-4a4e-840e-be8d288d1705&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;6cc460d0bb47b74f729235acc752b1dec719a62c&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:3456,&quot;height&quot;:3456,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/6cc460d0bb47b74f729235acc752b1dec719a62c.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"></figure><p>In his 1826 essay \u201c<a href=\"http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Essays/Hazlitt/Hating.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">On the Pleasure of Hating</a>,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Hazlitt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Hazlitt</a> speaks of our rueful inability to \u201cpart with the essence or principle of hostility,\u201d and of hatred being \u201cthe very spring and thought of action.\u201d Hazlitt\u2019s thesis\u2014he would have found kin in Lawrence\u2014is that the joy of hate is intrinsic to our cantankerous tribe. \u201cLove turns, with a little indulgence, to indifference or disgust: Hatred alone is immortal.\u201d We might have been civilized enough \u201cto give up the external demonstration, the <i>brute</i> violence,\u201d but the urge to such violence throbs in us still.

Before the imperium of the internet, there was a pleasing ritual involved: The hate mailer had to put pen to pad, choose the envelope and stamp, unearth the address of the publication in which the offense appeared, then walk down the block to the mailbox. It was a personal affair, from the hater\u2019s hand to the author\u2019s. And the chances were high that the author would read the letter, too. Remember when you used to get letters in the mail?

And then there\u2019s the kind of hate mail that achieves its effects not through any specific slur in any one message, but through sheer electronic blitzkrieg\u2014as with the gentleman who sends me six emails a day, every day, each with a link to data \u201cproving\u201d the existence of UFOs, and this because I made, in an otherwise <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/23/paranoid-the-x-files-are-here-to-help.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">affectionate piece on <i>The X-Files</i></a>, an entirely reasonable pronouncement about the stupidity of believing in UFOs, never mind in alien abduction.</p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed figure-active\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/60e4316a2ff09d6a0c24cb8a41b97a90344cd576.jpeg?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1f128cd6-544d-4acb-b9ec-cac9d68b4f96&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;60e4316a2ff09d6a0c24cb8a41b97a90344cd576&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:2592,&quot;height&quot;:3615,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/60e4316a2ff09d6a0c24cb8a41b97a90344cd576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"></figure><p>Of course hate mailers can\u2019t be relied on for propriety, but many of them choose to forgo salutations, as if to declare that you aren\u2019t worthy of one, even though you were somehow worthy of being written to in the first place. Many will nix the \u201cDear\u201d\u2014you are not dear to them\u2014and begin only with the clerical thud of your full name, followed not by the more comely comma but by the two fang marks of a colon. They dump their radiant glumness upon you and then don\u2019t even bother to sign their names. The gist common to all my hate mail is not only that I\u2019m stupendously wrong in whatever view I\u2019ve espoused\u2014hate mailers have a qualmless relationship with right and wrong\u2014but that I don\u2019t deserve the honor of espousing such views, of inflicting them upon minds that wish to remain undefiled by someone else\u2019s ideas. The tenor of their hate is always: <i>How the hell did </i>you<i> get hired? </i></p><p>And that\u2019s something else I can\u2019t help but notice: Many hate mailers are clearly themselves writers, aspiring or frustrated or homicidally disappointed\u2014as with the person who didn\u2019t like one of my essays and so wrote to tell me that he was no longer submitting his work to the literary journal for which I\u2019m an editor. (He also added the punitive mantra of hate mailers everywhere: \u201cCancel my subscription.\u201d When <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/william-f-buckley-jr-9230494\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">William F. Buckley</a> published a collection of his replies to piqued readers of <i>National Review</i>, he called it <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Cancel-Your-Own-Goddam-Subscription/dp/0465002420\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cancel Your Own Goddam Subscription</a></i>.) So although their ire is aimed at you and whatever you wrote that set them off, the real target of that ire, I suspect, is the publishing business itself, the gatekeepers who won\u2019t let them through. I can empathize: No matter where a writer is in his career, there are always gates he can\u2019t get through.</p><p>Suffering from terminal neglect and the infertility of his wrath, the hate mailer wants your attention, and so the unkindest thing you can do is not to cut him down in a reply, but to deny him the rumble or rumba he\u2019s come looking for\u2014never write back. You can\u2019t quarrel with inanity; it makes more sense than you do. What\u2019s worse, hate mailers are all too often humor-impaired, and is it me, or do the humor-impaired have a badly skewed picture of what\u2019s happening in the world? One wishes for wiser, funnier detractors, worthier adversaries.<span> </span></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>As someone who doesn\u2019t send hateful mail to strangers, I\u2019m left wondering about the precise motivations of those who do. What do they <i>want</i> exactly? It can\u2019t be simply to cheer themselves up, to scold, or to convince you of your erroneous ways. The likes of a Lawrence or a West had a hard-won <i>ars poetica</i> to assert and defend, but for today\u2019s average hate mailer, something else is going on. The political and cultural critic <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/01/25/i_love_my_fox_news_enemies_what_i_learned_from_the_most_hateful_emailers_in_the_world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steve Almond has written recently</a> about his horde of haters:<span> </span></p><blockquote><p>These letters, as I came to see it, represented an unedited transcript of America\u2019s seething id. Not the airbrushed insinuation retailed by Fox News, but the monstrous grievance roiling within its viewers. \u2026 The wrath directed at me was the logical byproduct of media devoted to monetizing the defensive rage of culturally dislocated citizens. \u2026 I continue to find the hate mail I elicit\u2014along with the jeremiads that reside in the comments sections of online pieces\u2014deeply compelling. They are one of the few spaces in our ideologically self-segregated culture where echo chambers collide. These outbursts, as repugnant as they can seem, often feel more authentic than the reasoned arguments we recite to those who already agree with us.</p></blockquote><p>Almond\u2019s is an incisive and merciful take, though what he sees as echo chambers are more frequently torture chambers. Even the kindest comments section is a petri dish of jaundice. What purpose could these sections possibly serve? For those venues sustained by advertising, the manic nuttiness keeps your eyes on the page for that much longer\u2014we enjoy watching others in a conniption as they attempt to type. For other venues, the comments section functions as a kind of welcome mat, an invitation to inclusion through dialogue. But the inclusion is illusion, because the dialogue is one diatribe after another. \u201cConversation,\u201d often with \u201chonest\u201d or \u201cadult\u201d tacked on to it, has become the preferred euphemism of those who seek to holler their opinions at you. (<a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Kingsley-Amis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingsley Amis</a> once quipped that you could normally count on the phrase \u201cmeaningful dialogue\u201d being uttered by \u201ca humorless ninny.\u201d)</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\"><p>People are desperate to be heard, to make some sound, any sound, in the world, and hate mail allows them the illusion of doing so. </p></aside><p>With the online comments section, hate mail, like everything else, has gone public, and mostly anonymous. The internet, says Almond, facilitated \u201cthe rapid erosion of the barrier between private animus and public expression,\u201d and that\u2019s well put. Writers have always earned hatred from certain readers: If you were <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ovid-Roman-poet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ovid</a>, that hatred got you banished from Rome; if <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Giordano-Bruno\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Giordano Bruno</a>, incinerated at the stake; if <a href=\"http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/flannery-oconnor-1925-1964\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flannery O\u2019Connor</a>, a scrawled shellacking from some unhappy Baptist in Georgia. In our sound-biting society of obliterated attention spans, you get blasphemed online, or else in your inbox\u2014instantaneously, by any mosquito with a keyboard. The internet didn\u2019t create hatred but, true to its name, the internet caught it. It\u2019s the modus operandi of online yokels to be outraged, every few minutes, by some trifle or another, to traffic in \u201cthe nothingness of scorn and noise,\u201d in <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Clare\u2019s immortal wording</a>. Their general confusion of rhetoric for logic and rationalization for reasoning is not merely their limit but a fairly damning limitation. Users are fleeing Twitter in packs, and its <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/04/29/twitters-stock-plummets-on-disappointing-results/#7669c734fd4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">stock lies at the bottom of an open grave</a>, and not only because of its restrictive platform, but because it\u2019s been from the start an engine of acrimony.</p><p>People are desperate to be heard, to make some sound, any sound, in the world, and hate mail allows them the illusion of doing so. Legions among us suffer from the anomie and malaise of modernity, from the discontents of an increasingly atomized society. Almond\u2019s mercy for his correspondents, even for those who wish him harm\u2014one beauty calls for his beheading\u2014is not a cynical emulation of Christ, but a measured awareness that people are rotten because they\u2019re wounded, lashing out in search of succor. The democratizing splendors of the internet, the equalizing of voices? Another illusion. If ideas were being heard in substantive, bountiful ways, online comments sections wouldn\u2019t be so impulsively rancorous. The new hatred has a terrified undercurrent: the dread of disappearing beneath the ceaseless waves of dissonance.</p><p>For writers in our culture, marginalized and irrelevant, hate mail at least means that someone is listening, even if with unfriendly ears. A mentor, a well-known critic who himself has been subjected to the quiverings of hate mail, said to me recently: \u201cBut you\u2019re <i>a little</i> disappointed when you don\u2019t get it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d And I had to confess that I was. Part of a writer\u2019s job should be to dishearten the happily deceived, to quash the misconceptions of the pharisaical, to lure the hermetic from whatever bolt-holes they\u2019ve built for themselves\u2014to unsettle and upset. If someone isn\u2019t riled by what you write, you aren\u2019t writing truthfully enough. Hate mail is what happens when you do. </p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133043/youve-got-hate-mail</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133043</guid><category><![CDATA[June 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Internet]]></category><category><![CDATA[Review]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter-top]]></category><category><![CDATA[-homepage-bottom1]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[William Giraldi]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/613a7b8332ebcf63744606480bb0424a62fb07b7.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[British Dream Now a Reality, as London Elects Its First Muslim Mayor]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In Pakistan, the chances that the son of a bus or rickshaw driver could secure a high-ranking political position in the country\u2019s capital city are minuscule. But now, the people of London <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sadiq-khan-wins-london-mayor-election-result-2016-zac-goldsmith-a7017106.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">have elected Sadiq Khan</a>\u2014the son of an immigrant Pakistani bus driver\u2014to be their first Muslim mayor.</p><aside id=\"signal-133379\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>While unable to influence the nation\u2019s foreign or economic policy, Khan will <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/WHAT-WE-DO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">have responsibility</a> for key areas in London, such as transport, housing, policing, and the environment. And being directly elected gives the London mayor <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/who-are-the-main-contenders-for-london-mayor-and-what-do-they-stand-for-57391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a personal mandate</a> which no other parliamentarian in Westminster\u2014including those in the cabinet\u2014enjoy.</p><p>Khan\u2019s father was one of hundreds of Pakistani men who migrated to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, seeking the U.K.\u2019s version of the American dream: stable employment, social mobility, and opportunities for a better future for themselves and their families. One of eight children, Khan grew up on a council estate in the capital. He went to university to study law and practiced as a solicitor in human rights cases before becoming a member of parliament.</p><p>Now, at the age of 45, he is mayor of London: the economic and cultural heart of the U.K., the largest city in western Europe, and one of the most important cities in the world. He is the immigrant success story\u2014for him, the British dream has become a reality.</p><h2>Race and religion</h2><p>Khan\u2019s Islamic faith catapulted the city\u2019s mayoral contest into the international limelight, at a time when Muslims are facing growing hostility in the West. In the U.S., presidential hopeful Donald Trump <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">has said</a> that he will ban Muslims from entering the country; while in Europe, the far right is gaining traction by campaigning on <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-protests-germany-idUSKCN0VF0P4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">explicitly anti-Muslim platforms</a>.</p><p>During the mayoral campaign, Khan\u2019s \u201cMuslimness\u201d was viewed as a liability by some\u2014including members of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/01/moderate-sadiq-khan-london-mayor-muslim-labour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">his own party</a>. His Conservative rival, Zac Goldsmith, accused Khan of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/24/sadiq-khan-unfit-to-be-london-mayor-says-zac-goldsmith/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sharing platforms</a> with Islamic extremists\u2014the implication was clear: that the public should be wary of his \u201cradical\u201d views. Goldsmith\u2019s highly controversial campaign has been heavily criticized\u2014notably by senior Conservative <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/zac-goldsmith-attacked-by-senior-tory-over-tactics-in-london-mayor-election?CMP=share_btn_tw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andrew Boff</a>\u2014for its divisive \u201c<a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2016/03/deafening-dogwhistle-zac-goldsmith-s-london-mayoral-campaign-leaflets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dog-whistle</a>\u201d politics.</p><p>Khan\u2019s victory supports what a number of Muslim commentators <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/01/moderate-sadiq-khan-london-mayor-muslim-labour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">have argued all along</a>: that having a Muslim mayor could help defeat Islamist ideology, by showing that the West is not anti-Islam\u2014and that Muslims can \u201cmake it\u201d there. Khan himself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/02/a-muslim-mayor-of-london-would-send-message-to-the-haters-says-sadiq-khan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">has spoken</a> about the symbolic value of becoming the first Muslim mayor of a city which experienced <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-weve-learned-about-radicalisation-since-7-7-bombings-a-decade-ago-44338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">terrorist attacks</a> in 2005, perpetrated in the name of Islam.</p><h2>Power and privilege</h2><p>But Khan\u2019s victory says as much about social mobility as it does about race and religion. Had Khan\u2019s father stayed in Pakistan, it is inconceivable that his son would have succeeded in that country\u2019s political system, where privilege and connections <a href=\"http://europe.newsweek.com/power-and-privilege-146857?rm=eu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">win elections</a>. There, political office is often viewed as the birth right of the elite. Indeed, the U.K. has educated a great many of Pakistan\u2019s political leaders: Mohammad Ali Jinnah\u2014the founder of Pakistan\u2014studied in England in the late nineteenth century. And Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was educated at Oxford, went on to serve as both as prime minister and president.</p><p>By contrast, many Pakistanis who migrated to the U.K. in the post-war era were <a href=\"http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137275158\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">subsistence farmers and manual laborers</a>. In many cases, they were illiterate in their own mother tongue. They took up positions in the service industries of the south, the factories and foundries of the Midlands and the mills of Northern England. And while some succeeded in pulling themselves out of poverty, the U.K.\u2019s Pakistani community still has some of the <a href=\"http://www.ethnicity.ac.uk/medialibrary/briefingsupdated/Ethnic%20inequalities%20in%20labour%20market%20participation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">highest levels of unemployment</a> and underachievement in the U.K. Many British Pakistanis live in some of <a href=\"http://www.ethnicity.ac.uk/medialibrary/briefingsupdated/ethnicity-and-deprivation-in-england-how-likely-are-ethnic-minorities-to-live-in-deprived-neighbourhoods%20(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the U.K.\u2019s most deprived neighborhoods</a>.</p><p>And of course, British politics is also now dominated by an \u201cold boys\u2019 network\u201d: the cliques of Etonions and Bullingdon club members, personified by the prime minister, David Cameron, the chancellor, George Osborne\u2014and indeed London\u2019s outgoing mayor, Boris Johnson. Yet the working-class Khan managed to win out against a Conservative rival with family pedigree, wealth, and friends in powerful political, media, and business circles.</p><p>For many, this is a triumph of meritocracy over privilege\u2014a sign that the political establishment is becoming more inclusive and representative of the ethnic, religious and socioeconomic diversity of the wider population. And Khan is not the only second-generation Pakistani to have entered high political office in the U.K. Sajid Javid, the current secretary of state for Business, Innovation, and Skills, is the son of a Pakistani immigrant who worked in the mills of the north before becoming a bus driver. So too did the father of Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, who rose to become a member of David Cameron\u2019s cabinet, and was the first Muslim woman to sit at the highest table in the land. In the 2015 general election alone, ten individuals of Pakistani heritage were elected to the British parliament.</p><p>And now, in London, the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver is in charge. He has become Europe\u2019s most powerful Muslim politician. Khan\u2019s victory has shown us that the British dream can become a reality.</p><p><img alt=\"The Conversation\" height=\"1\" src=\"//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/58945/count.gif\" width=\"1\"></p><p><i>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://theconversation.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Conversation</a>.

Largely unavailable to him were the conventional tools factional and party leaders use to advance their causes. Sanders was a relatively infrequent guest on national news programs. He seldom campaigned outside his home state for Democrats, and when he did, it wasn\u2019t to a mass of supporters fanning out toward the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>Sanders\u2019s first fleeting taste of national fame came, as so many moments in the spotlight do these days, on social media, when he protested President Obama\u2019s 2010 decision to temporarily renew regressive George W. Bush-era tax cuts by occupying the Senate floor and delivering an eight-and-a-half hour <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLNKNq9soLE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">oratorical remonstration</a> against inequality and oligarchy in America. The performance was a sensation among denizens of the online left, and later became the basis of a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Speech-Historic-Filibuster-Corporate-Decline/dp/1568586841\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">book</a> titled <i>The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of our Middle Class</i>. But by that time, the Bush tax cuts had been extended and Sanders had returned to relative obscurity, resurfacing only once, to promote the idea of a progressive primary challenge ahead of Obama\u2019s re-election campaign. Democrats rebuffed him overwhelmingly.</p><p>It\u2019s not that Sanders\u2019s vision for the country was denied a hearing because it was fringe\u2014promoters of ideas far more extreme are received warmly in the media all the time. Sanders wasn\u2019t on the news often because he was often unable to make news. He was a political independent, for one thing. Moreover, activist progressives like him lacked the numbers and organizational prowess to force their ideas on the Democratic Party the way movement conservatives have done to Republicans for decades.</p><p>It took a relentless and phenomenally underestimated presidential primary campaign for his message to finally break through to the masses, and as it turns out the receptive audience was enormous. Over the course of a year, Sanders has hosted dozens of rallies the size of small cities, won 19 caucuses and primaries so far in states large and small (with another <a href=\"/article/133368/donald-trumps-finance-chair-anti-populist-hell\">expected </a>in West Virginia on Tuesday), and compiled a massive list of supporters, comprising millions of people who together donated <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00000528\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">north of $100 million to his campaign</a>.</p><p>But like many insurgents who came before him attempting hostile takeovers\u2014the Eugene McCarthys, Jesse Jacksons, Howard Deans\u2014Sanders is not going to secure the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination. In the near term\u2014between the end of the primaries in June and November 8, 2016\u2014this confronts him with the narrow question of how aggressively and passionately to campaign for the person who beat him.&nbsp;</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\"><p><span>The danger is that Sanders\u2019s challenge to Democratic orthodoxy could have no more lasting impact on the party than those of the insurgents who\u2019ve come before.</span></p></aside><p>But beyond this election, Sanders\u2019 newfound clout will confront him with a much different set of questions, stemming from this basic challenge: How can he continue to harness the enthusiasm that defined his candidacy beyond the time-limited scope of a campaign? How can he avoid the common traps that have ensnared so many other reformers with national followings\u2014like becoming subsumed into the system he wants to change, or allowing the followers he\u2019s nurtured to disengage from politics?</p><p>The dream scenario for Sanders Democrats is that he\u2019ll end up, like Barry Goldwater, sparking a movement that eventually comes to dominate his party. The danger is that his challenge to Democratic orthodoxy could end up having no more lasting impact on the party than those of the insurgents who\u2019ve come before him.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>There\u2019s a playbook Sanders could follow that would end in tears for his supporters. The Sanders campaign bears more than a passing resemblance to Dean\u2019s, which never translated into anything like the kind of revolution Sanders wants to foster. Though Dean forced a course correction on a Democratic establishment that had become a dangerously pliant enabler of the George W. Bush administration, he only moved his party to the left incrementally. But, happily for Sanders backers, it\u2019s the differences between the Dean and Sanders phenomena that offer hope that the Sanders moment could endure. For his campaign to pay continuous progressive dividends, he will have to exploit the qualities that distinguished his crusade from the crusades of other Democrats.</p><p>Dean, it\u2019s important to remember, came to national prominence because congressional Democrats supported the invasion and occupation of Iraq, and had more generally bungled post-September 11 national security politics. His campaign was the first in history to use digital tools to raise money and organize, and might have succeeded had it not <a href=\"/article/132638/primary-concerns-episode-9-divide-flounder\">been beset by internal dysfunction.</a> But Dean lost the 2004 Democratic primary\u2014to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kerry-clinches-nomination-10-03-2004/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a candidate</a> who had supported the war, no less\u2014and the Dean machine diffused into the liberal ether. That isn\u2019t to say it disappeared, but it became attenuated, thinly spread, and was ultimately largely subsumed into the machine that Sanders now sets up as a foil.</p><p>Deaniacs brought scale and professionalism to the grassroots group MoveOn.org. They worked for progressive candidates and members of Congress. They joined the labor movement. They created a social media and fundraising model that Barack Obama would eventually use to greater effect. And they converted the campaign itself into the advocacy group, Democracy for America, which backs progressive causes and politicians, including Sanders, to this day. But their victories accumulated slowly. In 2006, with Dean chairing the Democratic National Committee, Democrats won the midterm elections in a landslide\u2014a \u201cthumpin\u2019,\u201d as President Bush so memorably described it. And over time, Dean\u2019s critique took hold within his own party, as Democrats began disavowing the war they had helped to start. But the Iraq War persisted through the Bush era, and much of the Obama era, and despite the official termination of Operation Iraqi Freedom, it continues in some ways to this day. &nbsp;</p><p><span>Here is where the differences begin to pile up. Sanders\u2019s campaign was better-run and more successful than Dean\u2019s. But more critically, its animating cause wasn\u2019t acute or ephemeral like an unjust war. Sanders isn\u2019t a critic of a single, massive policy error, or of liberalism cowering briefly to neoconservatism in the wake of a national panic, but of the very foundation of the American political economy. Sanders seeks nothing less than the wholesale transformation of the Democratic Party into a vessel for social-democratic politics.</span><br></p><p>Sanders\u2019s critique will continue to appeal to his cohort of liberal supporters\u2014many of whom came of political age amid the devastation of a massive failure of Western capitalism\u2014at least until the economy becomes healthier and more equitable. He built his following through a shared sense that inequality, oligarchy, and income stagnation are moral failings of a corrupt or indifferent political system. The breadth of these injustices will theoretically give Sanders supporters more focal points for activism than Dean\u2019s supporters had.&nbsp;</p><p>But <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-bernie-sanders-movement-20160501-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">as they grapple with how to prevent the enthusiasm for his candidacy from fizzling out</a>, they will need trusted leadership, and Sanders has been vague about how or whether he will marshal the forces he\u2019s unleashed. The Democratic Party won\u2019t be fully remade in Sanders\u2019s lifetime\u2014he is 74, after all\u2014but it probably won\u2019t happen at all without his early involvement. To succeed where others failed, Sanders can\u2019t simply become a functionary, working to reform the Democratic establishment from within. The inside game will be a big part of the project, but not the only part. Sanders must keep the apparatus he\u2019s built largely intact, but refocused on lobbying for progressive policies and promoting and financing progressive candidates\u2014and making establishment Democrats fear the price of opposing both. Part MoveOn.org, channeling grassroots enthusiasm for progressive causes; part Heritage Action, forcing conformity upon Sanders\u2019s party.</p><p>Such an operation will lose momentum quickly if Sanders is not its key spokesman and final decision-maker. It will also lose momentum if long stretches of time pass without big progressive causes to champion, and here Sanders can use his status as a sitting senator to his advantage. It is feasible that Democrats will reclaim the Senate in 2016, and if they do, Sanders is in line to chair the Budget Committee, a panel with limited formal jurisdiction, but vast agenda-setting potential. A congressional budget lacks the force of law, but often serves as a statement of the majority party\u2019s governing objectives: Who are we going to tax, how much, and to what end?&nbsp;</p><p>It was from the helm of the House Budget Committee that now-Speaker Paul Ryan was able to rally Republicans around a radical agenda that has formed the basis of nearly every GOP candidate\u2019s platform since its introduction. Should Sanders use his chairmanship in a similar way, he will extend the intra-liberal debate he sparked during the primary about the ideal scope and architecture of social policy into governing season. He\u2019ll keep pressing the question: What should a country provide its citizenry, and should it provide those things to all, or only to some, on the basis of need?</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\">Sanders\u2019s movement should be p<span>art MoveOn.org, channeling grassroots enthusiasm for progressive causes, and part Heritage Action, forcing conformity upon his party.</span></aside><p>Like a Ryan of the left, Sanders will have an opportunity to cajole (and if need be, push) Democrats in a more progressive direction, but he can also serve as a bulwark against regressive policymaking, the same way conservatives have time and again stopped Republican leaders from consorting with Democrats on any measure that carries a whiff of liberalism. If and when President Clinton forges illiberal compromises with Republican leaders, Sanders will be one of the only people in Congress with a constituency wide enough to make other Democratic members consider rebelling against the leader of their party. </p><p><span>The toughest task for the Sanders movement may ultimately be the most important: finding enough talented progressive politicians to run for office, financing them well enough to compete in the money-drenched world of modern politics, and getting them elected in parts of the country that aren\u2019t already reliably progressive. For Sanders to turn his national constituency into mutable political leverage, he will need acolytes who adhere to fairly strict ideological criterion\u2014and win. The lesson of right-wing Republican politics, from Goldwater to Gingrich to the Tea Party, has been that imposing purity tests on candidates can lead to embarrassing failures (such as the candidacies of Sharron Angle, Christine O\u2019Donnell, and others), but also that fielding ideologically committed candidates can pay huge dividends, both electorally and in expanding the scope of substantive debate. (It isn\u2019t an accident that by today\u2019s standards, Ronald Reagan would be considered a moderate Republican.)</span><br></p><p>But moving the Democratic Party leftward in a similar way, far beyond the liberalism of Clinton and Obama, will be expensive, and thus require a fundraising machine that picks up where the Sanders campaign leaves off. Money is a foregone conclusion for most conservative candidates. But while Sanders famously proved that millions of people will contribute an average of $27 a pop to finance his campaign, we still don\u2019t know how extensive that largesse really is. How many of those donors have the means to support multiple candidates simultaneously, at a similar level of giving? </p><p><span>The obstacles are considerable, but it is possible to imagine Sanders breaking the mold of previous Democratic insurgents and converting the machine he\u2019s built into a movement whose influence and power nobody questions. Progressives have compiled big lists before, only to be reminded that they are just one faction among many in Democratic politics. Until Sanders came along, they weren\u2019t even a particularly formidable one. We\u2019ll know before too long if that has changed.</span><br></p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133365/bernie-sanderss-next-revolution</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133365</guid><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bernie Sanders]]></category><category><![CDATA[Democratic Primary 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Democratic Party]]></category><category><![CDATA[Progressive]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Howard Dean]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Brian Beutler]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 13:19:02 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/3df28233a90662bf81293acaee93058d7a1be951.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[And There They Died]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class=\"article-embed pull-right\"><div style=\"max-width: 300px;\"><a href=\"https://instagram.com/newrepublic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/55a3bb6ec1c86a0b5e3e609cca21ad5554d9f679.png?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b7b8ad34-b2df-496d-9b18-a40dc135a8f4&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;55a3bb6ec1c86a0b5e3e609cca21ad5554d9f679&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;height&quot;:155,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;PNG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/55a3bb6ec1c86a0b5e3e609cca21ad5554d9f679.png&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"></a></div></figure><p><span>Their deaths are invisible, counted with makeshift memorials made out of cardboard, store-bought religious candles, and laminated photographs to survive the elements.

Dylan Klebold was 17 years old when he and his friend\nEric Harris opened fire on Colorado\u2019s Columbine High School. The two boys shot\nand killed 13 people and wounded 24 before turning their guns on\nthemselves. The word \u201cColumbine\u201d no longer needs any explanation: It now\nstands in for a communal loss of innocence, and for the beginning of a series\nof public debates that still rage on about the cultural forces children grow up\nwith. In the aftermath of the shooting, Sue Klebold writes, \u201cpeople blamed\nvideo games, movies, music, bullying, access to guns, unarmed teachers, the\nabsence of prayer in schools, secular humanism, psychiatric medication. Mostly,\nthough, they blamed us.\u201d</p><p>Sue Klebold may have found herself at the center of a\nnational tragedy, but she was, first and foremost, a mother mourning the death\nof her youngest child, and trying to reconcile the memory of the boy she loved with\nthe young man who murdered his fellow students without apparent reason or\nremorse. She writes that, for her, \u201cthere was no lasting comfort in casting\nDylan as a monster\u2026 The rest of the world could explain away what he had done:\neither he was born evil\u2014a bad seed\u2014or he\u2019d been raised without moral guidance.\nI knew it wasn\u2019t nearly so simple.\u201d</p><p>Columbine was not the first school shooting in America, but\nit was the first to make Americans realize just how easily a classroom could\nbecome a killing field. It was knowledge that seemed capable of changing us\nforever. It hasn\u2019t. Two decades later, we seem to have learned very little\nabout how to prevent similar violence. The problem has grown not better, but\nworse. If Columbine held a lesson for us, then we have been unable or unwilling\nto understand it. One of the most crucial questions <i>A Mother\u2019s Reckoning </i>poses is whether the lessons we can take from\nsuch crimes are most visible to those who have known\u2014and loved\u2014their\nperpetrators.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>There are some names\u2014Bundy, Dahmer, Manson, Gacy,\nRam\u00edrez\u2014that can sell any book, no matter how poorly written or void of insight\nit may be.

It\u2019s a template that flattens the murderer into a\npersonification of evil, void of the weaknesses and idiosyncrasies that might\notherwise denote him as human. It\u2019s also an approach that seems to make\neveryone happy, up to and sometimes including the killer himself (\u201cI\u2019m the\nNight Stalker!\u201d Richard Ram\u00edrez gleefully told one of his victims, after\nreporters coined that dark honorific).

Yet if\nyou want to find <i>The Phantom Prince, </i>the\nmemoir his longtime girlfriend wrote about their relationship, you\u2019ll need to\nshell out at least $120 for a mildewed second-hand copy from 1981. The book was\nreleased by a small Seattle publisher and is now long out of print, and its\ncontents have never seeped into the groundwater of Ted Bundy mythology\u2014perhaps\nbecause they reveal him as all too human.</p><p><i>The Phantom Prince </i>is\ncredited to an author named Elizabeth Kendall. \u201cKendall\u201d is a pseudonym, chosen\nto protect the identity of a woman who was already risking a great deal by\nadmitting to a relationship with a man accused of murdering more than 30 young women. \u201cElizabeth\u201d is not. Liz, as Ted Bundy knew her, was a shy and\ninsecure 24-year-old when she moved to Seattle with her daughter in 1969. Ted,\nas Liz knew him, was a 23-year-old student destined for success. Their\nattraction was instant, both physically\u2014\u201cOh God, I hadn\u2019t remembered how gorgeous\nhe was,\u201d Liz remembers thinking when Ted woke her with a cup of coffee\u2014and emotionally.\nLiz, fresh from a divorce, wanted to feel like she and her daughter were still\na family. Ted wanted to belong to one. The first time they went to bed, Liz\nwrote, \u201cWe made love as though this would be the last time we would ever see\neach other, as if we were trying to get enough of each other to last a\nlifetime... I had never felt this close to any man before.\u201d<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span></p><p>The relationship <i>The\nPhantom Prince </i>describes is one between two vulnerable young adults who\nhungered for affection and stability. The Ted that Liz knew was a warm,\ncharming, and impulsive young man who lusted after badges of achievement\u2014jobs,\ndegrees, titles\u2014while remaining childishly reluctant to work for what he wanted,\nso long as he could secure it through other means. He watched cartoons with Liz\u2019s\ndaughter, cooked her fancy dinners, stole the luxury items he couldn\u2019t afford,\nprocrastinated on work projects, and lied about being enrolled in law school.\nLiz became a mother figure to him, and even after his trial and imprisonment in\nUtah\u2014and his subsequent escape and flight to Florida, where he committed the\nthree murders that ultimately led to his execution\u2014she was often less afraid of\nhim than for him.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>Any of the dozens of true crime writers who have weighed in\non the Bundy case in the ensuing decades would likely say this was all part of\na psychopath\u2019s master plan: that Bundy carefully cultivated a human side which he\nthen used to dupe women, including Liz, while remaining a bloodthirsty killing\nmachine just below the surface. The version of Ted Bundy that Liz\u2019s book\ndepicts is more complicated, but no less believable. He is a man who was\ncapable of being both gentle and violent, and whose greatest cruelties issued\nnot from some dark and inhuman strength, but from denial, compulsion, and\nbrokenness. \u201cI just can\u2019t seem to connect with people,\u201d he told Liz, less than\na year before his arrest. \u201cSure I can hold doors open for women and smile and\nbe charming, but when it comes to basic relationships I just don\u2019t have it.\nThere\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>Liz also yearned for Ted even as she began to suspect him of\nterrible crimes, and her honesty in expressing that impossible combination of\ndesires\u2014to both flee and comfort the man she loved\u2014suffuses <i>The Phantom Prince, </i>which was published\njust one year after Ted Bundy was sentenced to die in the electric chair. The\nbook is breathtaking in its vulnerability, and by its end, Liz still does not\nknow what to think about the man she once thought she understood.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Throughout the years her memoir describes, Liz at least had\nthe dubious luxury of a grace period: a time during which she could see the\nevidence mounting against Ted as troubling, but not necessarily damning. As the\nnews broke about his son\u2019s crimes, Lionel Dahmer had no such freedom. When his\nson Jeffrey was arrested in July of 1991, his apartment and its shocking,\nputrefying contents immediately made national headlines. \u201cDahmer\u201d\u2014like \u201cBundy\u201d\nand \u201cKlebold\u201d\u2014is a name that has come to signify evil in human form; it is a\ngood name to spit, to hurl, to whisper.

Without blaming himself for his son\u2019s\ncrimes, he endlessly revisits the cruelly hopeful calculus of mourning,\nwondering whether some chance word or action could have made a difference. <i>A Father\u2019s Story</i>\u2014which has also been out\nof print for years\u2014ends with a father\u2019s longing not just to alter the past but\nto reconnect with a son of who seems lost to the world.

It is also not a catharsis: Sue is writing not\nprimarily for herself, but for us. She has gotten through, to the extent that\nanyone could ever \u201cget through,\u201d the work of reconciling \u201cthe cherub with the\nhalo of golden hair who used to giggle while smashing kisses into my face, and\nthe man\u2014the killer\u2014on [the television] screen.\u201d She knows what she believes\nabout her son. She knows what he did, and she knows that she still loves him. She\nhas learned as much as a mother can from such a tragedy. The question, now, is\nwhat the reader will do with the knowledge she has gleaned from her personal\ntour of Hell.</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span></p><p>Yet before Sue Klebold shares this knowledge, she has to\nshow us that the boy she knew really existed. This information is not for her,\nbut for anyone who looked at images of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris\u2014or of the\nother young men who have committed similar crimes in the years since\u2014and thought\nthat those around them just <i>had to know </i>something\nwas wrong. The Dylan Klebold that Sue describes gave no sign of such potential.\nThe Dylan she shows us is a shy, affectionate child, and a thoughtful,\nresponsible adolescent who puts care into family gifts, who works hard at\nafter-school jobs, who loves eating Oreos and playing poker and watching <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000, </i>and who\nseems happily enfolded in a circle of loving family and friends.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p>In some ways he is. In others he isn\u2019t. Dylan is also a\nperfectionist whose fear of failure and humiliation arrest his efforts at\nschool, and a people pleaser who cultivates such a wall of secrecy around his\ndepression that his family does not learn of it until after his death. In one\nkeenly devastating moment, Sue Klebold reads her son\u2019s writings and learns that\nhe fantasized about suicide for a full two years before Columbine. During those\ntwo years, she tells us, she never once suspected that he might be depressed.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">The question, now, is\nwhat the reader will do with the knowledge she has gleaned from her personal\ntour of Hell.&nbsp;</aside><p><i>A Mother\u2019s Reckoning </i>is\na remarkable book not just for what it does contain, but for what it doesn\u2019t.\nThroughout, Sue Klebold traces her own slow path away from denial: her initial\ndesire to believe that Dylan had been drugged or brainwashed into taking part in\nthe shooting, her disbelief at the apparent coldness with which he shot and\nkilled his fellow students, and her longing to describe his actions as the\nresult of a \u201cmoment of madness.\u201d Even at a distance of nearly 20 years, and\neven knowing all she does now, Sue Klebold could still take shelter in denial.\nIt would be difficult to blame her if, within this book, she claimed that Eric\nHarris had coerced and abused her innocent son into joining him, or that\nreports of the callous remarks Dylan made during the shooting must have been\nfabricated, or that the Dylan who terrorized and killed helpless people was not\nthe Dylan <i>she </i>knew\u2014that he had\n\u201csnapped\u201d and become unrecognizable, no longer a boy but a killing machine,\nas some media accounts have in fact argued. She could claim that violent video\ngames were the sole culprit, or that bullying was, or that her son had been a\ncloseted psychopath who hid his true face from her for his entire life.</p><p>People have said as much, and still do. People who do not\nhave to carry the debilitating weight of this tragedy through their daily lives\nhave simplified Columbine into something simple and disposable, and Dylan into\nas simple a figure: a bloodthirsty villain or a blameless dupe. But Sue Klebold,\nin the course of both the period of her life that <i>A Mother\u2019s Reckoning </i>details and the book itself, remains utterly\ndetermined to resist easy answers. At heart, the book is not a portrait of\nDylan, but a portrait of Sue Klebold\u2019s grief, because her grief has taught her\nthat Dylan will always be, in some ways, unknowable.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Sue Klebold is now a suicide prevention activist, and\nthroughout <i>A Mother\u2019s Reckoning </i>she\nappeals to parents to learn how to recognize depression in children and\nadolescents, and to resist the belief that their own children are immune. \u201cI\nbelieve Eric went to school to kill people and didn\u2019t care if he died,\u201d an FBI\npsychologist tells Sue, \u201cwhile Dylan wanted to die and didn\u2019t care if others\ndied as well.\u201d By telling the story not just of an infamous crime but of her\nson\u2019s depression and suicide, Sue Klebold makes it impossible for the reader to\nkeep her experience at a distance.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>She is also careful not to reduce Columbine\u2014or, by\nextension, any similar tragedy\u2014to this single issue. But by focusing on her\nson\u2019s suicidal depression, she shows how such seemingly incomprehensible events\ncan be broken down to their component parts, whatever they may be.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p>It is difficult to imagine preventing a notorious crime, especially\nwhen crimes of such magnitude are so often presented to us as inevitable\ncollisions between good and evil. But suicide prevention inspires a different\nconversation altogether. It leads us to ask not \u201cWhy?\u201d but \u201cHow?\u201d\u2014and,\naccording to Sue Klebold, this is the question we should be asking. \u201cAsking\n\u2018how\u2019 instead of \u2018why\u2019 allows us to frame the descent into self-destructive\nbehavior as the process that it is,\u201d she writes. \u201cHow does someone progress\nalong a path toward hurting oneself or others? How does the brain obscure\naccess to its own tools of self-governance, self-preservation, and conscience?\n... Asking \u2018why\u2019 only makes us feel helpless. Asking \u2018how\u2019 points the way\nforward, and shows us what we must do.\u201d</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133362/memoirs-school-shooters-mother</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133362</guid><category><![CDATA[Books]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mass Shootings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Columbine]]></category><category><![CDATA[Memoir]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah Marshall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/f847eb409b1a238511e62406142268bb648d97a1.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Donald Trump\u2019s Finance Chair Is the Anti-Populist From Hell ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><span>Donald Trump\u2019s first major staff selection since securing the Republican nomination, </span><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-05/trump-names-hedge-fund-manager-as-national-finance-chairman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">national finance chairman</a><span> Steven Mnuchin, co-founded and manages the hedge fund Dune Capital.

They have venerated him throughout the Republican primary for rejecting the dirty business of pay-to-play politics, and for populist vows to protect the ordinary worker. But in selecting Mnuchin, not only has Trump submitted to the realities of presidential campaign finance; he\u2019s chosen one of the most notorious bankers in America to carry it out.</p><p>When I heard Mnuchin\u2019s name last week, I immediately remembered the front lawn of his mansion. Back in 2011, local housing activists and the Occupy movement in Los Angeles <a href=\"http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/success-breeds-success-powerful-anti-bank-protests-building-movement-energy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">camped out on that lawn</a> to save the home of Rose Mary Gudiel, a La Puente, California, resident who faced eviction after being just two weeks late on one mortgage payment. The activists threatened to move all of Gudiel\u2019s furniture into Mnuchin\u2019s $26 million Bel Air estate if the eviction wasn\u2019t stopped. Twenty police officers and a helicopter met the protesters.</p><p>Why was Mnuchin\u2019s front lawn the focal point for the protest? Because years after forming Dune Capital in 2004, Mnuchin\u2019s hedge fund purchased the <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/12/news/companies/indymac_fdic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">failed lender IndyMac</a>, one of America\u2019s largest home lenders and a leading distributor of Alt-A mortgages, a subprime hybrid which did not require borrowers to accurately state their incomes. After IndyMac failed, Dune led the investment group that purchased it from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 2009, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/20/business/fi-indymac20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">renaming it OneWest Bank</a>. Mnuchin became OneWest\u2019s principal owner and chairman.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>The purchase\u2014which happened, remember, during the height of the financial crisis\u2014was kind of a can\u2019t-lose proposition for Mnuchin and his investors. The FDIC, as part of a standard deal they made on transactions for failed banks during the financial crisis, agreed to cover all losses above the first 20 percent on loan defaults. That limited the downside risk of foreclosures, and OneWest could easily recoup its other losses with various fees. Protected by a federal backstop, OneWest <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cit-onewest-takeover-20140722-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">turned $3 billion in profits</a> from 2009 to 2014, off an initial investment of $1.65 billion. They spun $1.86 billion of that out to investors in <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/cit-to-buy-onewest-for-3-4-billion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dividend payments</a>. Meanwhile, the FDIC wound up losing $13 billion on the IndyMac failure, and will <a href=\"http://www.calreinvest.org/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMTIvMTYvMDdfMzNfNTVfMTI2X0NSQ19GRElDX0xvc3NfU2hhcmVfRmFjdF9TaGVldC5wZGYiXV0/CRC%20FDIC%20Loss%20Share%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pay an estimated $2.4 billion</a> to OneWest for its foreclosure costs.</p><p>As the servicer for many of the old IndyMac mortgages that were sold to investors, OneWest made decisions on whether to offer troubled homeowners loan modifications, or to foreclose on them. It routinely chose the latter. \u201cDuring Mnuchin\u2019s tenure, OneWest foreclosed on tens of thousands of families, with California\u2019s communities of color shouldering a disproportionate share,\u201d says Kevin Stein of the California Reinvestment Coalition, a housing advocacy organization. <a href=\"https://badbankmerger.com/maps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maps</a> provided by his organization show that, of the 36,382 OneWest foreclosures in California between 2009 and 2015, 68 percent of the foreclosures occurred in zip codes with a majority non-white population. While foreclosures <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/foreclosure-crisis-not-over-for-minorities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hurt non-white families</a> more than their white counterparts overall, these numbers are extreme.</p><p>Some of OneWest\u2019s foreclosure stories were particularly heartless. Leslie Parks of Minneapolis was negotiating with OneWest for a modification, when she came home during a blizzard in December 2009 to <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/after-2-year-foreclosure-battle-she-owns-minneapolis-home/128110078/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">find the locks changed</a>. This practice of \u201cdual tracking\u201d\u2014 negotiating with a homeowner while pursuing foreclosure\u2014violates federal servicing statutes. It took Parks two years to end the ordeal, receiving a grant to keep the home. Rose Mary Gudiel, the woman who camped out on Mnuchin\u2019s lawn, also <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44908122/ns/us_news-life/t/homeowner-taps-occupy-protest-avoid-foreclosure/#.Vy9YLlYycds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">got a loan modification</a> to save her home. But typically only the cases that reached the headlines ended happily; tens of thousands of others ended in foreclosure.<span> </span></p><p>OneWest accomplished these foreclosures through fraud. Erica Johnson-Seck, a vice president of foreclosure and bankruptcy for OneWest, explained in a <a href=\"http://4closurefraud.org/2009/11/15/full-deposition-of-the-infamous-erica-johnson-seck-re-indymac-federal-bank-fsb-plaintiff-vs-israel-a-machado-50-2008-ca-037322xxxx-mb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">July 2009 deposition</a> that she \u201crobo-signed\u201d 6,000 foreclosure-related documents per week, spending just 30 seconds on each sworn affidavit that attested to the veracity of all relevant information in the case. Johnson-Seck admitted to not reading the documents before signing them, to not knowing how the records were generated, and to not signing in the presence of a notary, all of which made the affidavits she signed false evidence in court.<span> </span></p><p>In the case where Johnson-Seck was deposed, OneWest was trying to foreclose in its own name, although it didn\u2019t own the loan. The bank executed a mortgage assignment after the foreclosure case was filed to try and cover that up. OneWest and other mortgage companies regularly executed this elaborate scheme, one of the biggest fraud scandals of the financial crisis era. In this case, the judge <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704029304575526182962738098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">threw out the foreclosure</a>, one of several homeowner victories against OneWest for wrongful foreclosure practices, some of them settled for <a href=\"https://tawebster.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/onewest-bank-pays-7-figures-in-mortgage-fraud-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">millions of dollars</a>.</p><p>But most OneWest homeowners were not so lucky, particularly seniors. OneWest had a subsidiary named Financial Freedom that specialized in reverse mortgages, the kind sold by <a href=\"https://www.onereversemortgage.com/about-us/henry-winkler/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">has-been actors</a> on late-night TV. In a reverse mortgage, homeowners aged 62 and older can extract the equity from their homes, receiving a sum of cash and deferring payments on that loan. While they\u2019re a way for seniors to acquire money, these are dangerous products, because interest and ongoing fees build up, while widows and widowers can face foreclosure when their spouses die.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\"><p>Trump as populist was always something of a pose, covering for a deep nationalism and antipathy to immigrants.

Most businesses in Xita, the Koreatown of Shenyang, capital city of China\u2019s Liaoning Province on the border with North Korea, were marked in Korean and Chinese. The streets in Xita resembled the bleak alleyways of Amsterdam\u2019s red light district. Finely made-up women, around 19 or 20 years old, stood in the doorways of the restaurants, wearing bright silk Korean <i>hanbok</i> and platform heels, Great Leader badges pinned to their chests, looking to attract passersby. These women <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/06/for-north-korean-state-waitresses-abroad-lives-of-rigor-and-temptation/239943/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wait tables, dance, and play North Korean songs</a> in nightly shows. It is widely known that the places where they work function as fronts for shadowy transactions, either illegal trade or money laundering. The women, chosen from upper-class families in Pyongyang and deployed here by their regime\u2019s secretive Bureau 39, are considered almost diplomats back home, although in truth they remind me of the maimed street children exploited by thugs to beg for cash. In Shenyang, there were several such North Korean restaurants, and one morning I walked into one to find a man called Haruto sitting with another man I had never met before. </p><aside id=\"signal-133036\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Haruto-san was a Japanese government official in his mid-forties who spoke fluent Korean. (I have changed Haruto\u2019s name to protect his identity.) I had met him by chance several years earlier in Yanji, another Chinese border town, through a North Korean defector I knew from Seoul. Haruto-san\u2019s job, he claimed, was to determine the whereabouts of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/12/north-korea-systematically-abducted-foreign-citizens-japanese-paper-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea</a> between 1977 and 1983. But the official tally was just 17 victims, and five had already been returned, so I suspected he had other responsibilities. Japan had long been accused of exploiting the issue to heighten tensions in the region so that it could embolden its military. Under the post-World War II <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/law/help/japan-constitution/article9.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pacifist constitution</a> imposed by the United States, Japan could not use military force except under a narrow, and contested, definition of self-defense. Whatever the real nature of his job, mild-mannered Haruto-san, with his black-rimmed glasses and a habit of nodding diligently, looked more like a professor than a government agent. He traveled to this corner of the Chinese border from Tokyo at least once a month. </p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\"><p>How could real relationships develop in a place where trust can lead to death and fear governs everything?&nbsp;</p></aside><p>Sitting before a steaming bowl of soup was a man whom Haruto-san introduced to me as Boss Yu. This title of \u201cBoss\u201d is a strange one; South Korean men sometimes address each other with it, similar to how Americans might use \u201cMister,\u201d but here it was a way to avoid revealing full names. Instead of saying \u201chello\u201d in greeting, Yu gestured to the waitress to bring another bowl for me. On the wall was a neon sign that read Pyongyang Dangogi-Jip, which meant the restaurant\u2019s specialty was \u201csweetmeat,\u201d the term for dog meat in North Korea. It was only eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, too early to eat, I told him\u2014although, in truth, my palate was not generous enough to include such soup. I asked for coffee instead, and the waitress brought a mug of brown, sugary instant. Haruto-san, a follower of Silver Birch spiritualism, who believed that anything with a mother should not be consumed, had only a cup of water before him. </p><p>Yu was a small man, about five-foot-six, with beady eyes, a dark complexion, and greasy hair. His heavy eyelids looked swollen, as though he\u2019d either drunk hard the night before or his food had been too salty. He appeared to be slightly older than Haruto-san but was dressed younger, in a nylon tracksuit with a Kappa logo, a shiny silver chain around his neck, and friendship bracelets on his wrist. Listening to him speak, it was hard to guess his origins: South Korean, ethnic Korean from China, ethnic Chinese from North Korea, or North Korean. Of these, only the South Korean accent is distinguishable from the others, and there have been cases of Korean-Chinese people passing themselves off as North Korean refugees to steal humanitarian aid. Despite the similarities, there is a certain something that distinguishes each one, which might be why Haruto-san told me later that while Yu had always said that he was South Korean, he wasn\u2019t entirely convinced. </p><p>When I asked Yu where he came from, he shrugged and said in rather nondescript Korean, \u201cEverywhere.\u201d He said that for a man like him, without much schooling, the world was the same anywhere, so he went wherever the winds took him\u2014Hong Kong; Thailand; Japan; and for the past few years, the Chinese towns bordering North Korea. He was a common merchant, he said, but when I asked him what he sold, he demurred. \u201cThis and that. Clothes, food, whatever makes money.\u201d The nature of his business with Haruto-san was unclear, and both were silent on the subject.</p><p>Once Yu finished his soup and sucked the marrow out of each dog bone, it was time to leave. Our destination was Dandong, three hours away, and Haruto-san had hired a car with a driver who chain-smoked the entire time, although the tobacco smoke did not seem <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34773556\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">much more toxic than the air in Shenyang</a>, which I was glad to leave behind. I was also relieved to be traveling accompanied, no matter how dubious my present companions. </p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed full-width\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/404cb67f9a64757ee7a9f2784c58aec0f2131887.jpeg?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;077c30f4-9531-4d6d-8463-2f825871b54e&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;404cb67f9a64757ee7a9f2784c58aec0f2131887&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:2756,&quot;height&quot;:1732,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/404cb67f9a64757ee7a9f2784c58aec0f2131887.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"></figure><p>Dandong had a rather nefarious reputation, shrouded in rumors of danger for those who deal with North Korea. \u201cWhat do you mean by danger?\u201d I had asked a visiting South Korean minister I met in Seoul earlier in my travels. He had lived in Dandong and helped North Korean defectors in the past. Lowering his voice as though he were used to whispering in fear, he said, \u201cPoison pen. One shot, and you are dead instantly.\u201d <i>Poison pen</i>? Who would use such a thing? But there had been reports of North Korean agents <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/25/world/asia/north-korea-assassination-weapons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">using poison needles</a> hidden inside ballpoint pens as weapons for assassination. \u201cIn Dandong, people are never who they say they are. North Korean agents are everywhere. Agents of all kinds are everywhere. You could disappear. Without a trace, with a trace, doesn\u2019t matter, no one would blink an eye.\u201d Our conversation began to sound like dialogue from a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel, which my journey at times resembled.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t doing much of anything then, just hanging around the region to fulfill the obligations of a fellowship that had given me a generous travel stipend. I was supposed to interview North Korean defectors, but having <a href=\"http://harpers.org/archive/2010/07/the-system-of-defecting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">already written extensively about them</a> in the past, I felt unable to rouse much enthusiasm for the task. So I traveled the usual escape routes from North Korea through China, which included the Mongolian and Laotian borders, as well as both coastlines of the Korean Peninsula. I kept running into nearly identical characters telling me nearly identical stories about defection. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrCQh1usdzE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vice on HBO</a>, CNN, the BBC, and South Korea\u2019s Channel A had been poking around the region, throwing money around, and a few self-proclaimed local experts had surfaced demanding ridiculous prices to broker meetings with defectors in flight, turning desperate escapes into reality TV. One South Korean expert on defections told me, \u201cAll those people are in it for the money: those TV crews following them around for some sensationalistic border crossing documentary, paying off human traffickers. South Koreans are horrible but the worst are the foreign ones because they are clueless, and their ignorance ends up costing lives.\u201d</p><p>The whole business was beginning to taste sour, and I kept moving from one border town to another until a message popped up from Haruto-san, who suggested that I join him on his next trip to the region. There was no further explanation of why he was going there, but I knew by now that it was better not to ask too many questions. Shenyang and Dandong, filled with North Korean defectors, contract workers, and government officials, are notorious hubs of sensitive information on North Korea, and I was hoping to learn something new.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Dawn broke early in Dandong, casting light on the smog-filled concrete landscape. My hotel faced the Yalu River, which forms part of the border between China and North Korea. Each room came equipped with an oversized window and a pair of binoculars. The draw for any visitor to Dandong is the view of the forbidden land. </p><p>Jutting out from the Chinese side of the river was an iron structure hanging in midair: the Broken Bridge, which was built in 1911 by Japan when it occupied Korea and this part of China. It was partially destroyed by U.S. bombers in 1950, during the Korean War, but its remnants have been kept intact by the Chinese government <a href=\"http://www.chinahighlights.com/dandong/attraction/broken-bridge-scenic-area.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">for tourism</a>. Adjacent to it was another bridge, built in 1943 during the Japanese occupation and later renamed the China-North Korea Friendship Bridge, which allowed car and rail traffic, but no pedestrians. It remains one of the few ways in and out of North Korea. </p><p>Across the narrow river, the eerily still facade of Sinuiju, a regional capital in North Korea\u2019s northwestern corner, struck me with a sinking sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. To my left was a ferris wheel and an abandoned, two-story construction site, and behind it a wall of posters, one of which read: Let\u2019s Arm Ourselves With Socialism And Absolute Watchfulness! Far to the right was an outcropping of buildings; atop one, a sign had been mounted that read Juche (the North Korean self-reliance ideology). In my decade following the trails of North Korea, I was always confronted with these images of monotone buildings and Great Leader-themed slogans. Even in Pyongyang, where I had spent nearly half a year in 2011 undercover, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Without-You-There-Is-No/dp/0307720659\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">teaching the sons of the country\u2019s elite</a> at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, I felt buried beneath the repetitions, every slogan, every building, every story of the Great Leader. Whatever I sought to understand about North Korea was always beyond my grasp; the country\u2019s inherent unknowability was a condition of its survival. And here I was in China, pointing binoculars towards the carefully manufactured sameness of North Korea, yet again hoping for some clue to a better understanding, which most likely did not exist. </p><p>The timing for my visit to Dandong was bad\u2014or good, depending on your perspective. North Korea had begun the year with <a href=\"https://csis.org/publication/north-koreas-third-nuclear-test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yet another nuclear test</a>, after the U.N. Security Council\u2019s decision to toughen sanctions against the country as a punishment for a previous ballistic missile test. North Korea then shut down the jointly operated <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-22011178\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kaesong Inter-Korean Industrial Complex</a>, which housed 123 South Korean companies and 53,000 North Korean workers who brought in $90 million per year in wages, paid directly to the North Korean regime. North Korea then announced the end of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which had been signed in 1953, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/12/world/asia/north-korea-questions.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">threatened a nuclear attack</a> against not only South Korea and Japan but the United States. Yet another American hostage had been sentenced to <a href=\"http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/02/18014886-american-gets-15-years-of-hard-labor-in-north-korea-for-hostile-acts?lite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">15 years of hard labor</a>. (He was an evangelical missionary accused of \u201chostile acts\u201d against the dprk regime.) The tensions between the two Koreas were at a high boil again, which was nothing new, and yet the intensified sanctions did not seem to affect the flourishing trade between China and North Korea; China accounts for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/world/asia/north-korea-china-sanctions-trade.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">90 percent of the country\u2019s foreign trade</a>, and Dandong handles about half of that. North Korea\u2019s largest exports\u2014coal, iron ore, and rare earth minerals\u2014flow into Dandong; imports of petroleum, garments, and machinery move the other way. <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2010/12/03-china-drug-trafficking-zhang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drugs</a> and weapons cross in both directions.\n</p><p>To kill time, I took a walk on the Broken Bridge, which drew a handful of mostly Chinese tourists. There wasn\u2019t much to do on a bridge that could not be crossed, except that it brought you a few steps closer to North Korea, and I felt oddly defeated walking back and forth. Along the Chinese side of the river, vendors sold trinkets bearing the images of Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung, as well as offering cheap rentals of makeshift <i>hanbok</i>. Groups of Chinese girls tied the apronlike dresses around themselves and posed before cameras with the view of North Korea in the background. There was something sadly humiliating about all this, to witness the beloved national garment reduced to a prop. From one of the vendors\u2019 radios blasted \u201c<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sFz9MONoSE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bangapseupnida</a></i>\u201d (\u201cWelcome\u201d), a popular and perky North Korean song:<span>&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p>Countrymen, brothers, let us hold hands,\n        <br><span>hot with feelings for the\nmotherland,<br></span><span>the unification festivities won\u2019t\nbe far away.<br></span><span>Welcome, welcome, welcome,\nwelcome.</span></p></blockquote><p>The irony of course was that theirs was the most unwelcoming land in the world, forbidden to outsiders, brother or no brother.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Haruto-san said that he was busy with meetings, so I ended up having dinner with Yu almost every night for the next two weeks, always at one of the North Korean restaurants in town. Yu said he was relieved that Haruto-san couldn\u2019t join us since his diet was too restricted. One time, he had screamed after catching a dog\u2019s muzzle floating in a soup they were sharing.&nbsp; </p><p>I had introduced myself as an American researcher, which was only partially true, but Yu seemed to consider me with more suspicion than I warranted. He had asked me at dinner at the Pyongyang Koryo restaurant what my identity was, and why I was there. Much like in Shenyang, this state-run establishment employed young North Korean female servers. They were inevitably overly flirtatious, and the food was inevitably overpriced and drenched in MSG. There are believed to be 130 such restaurants around the world, about 100 of them in China. In Yanji, the young women at one of these places are so overworked that after closing they rush over to the nightclub at a nearby hotel for a shift of musical performance and cocktail waitressing with male customers whose Chinese yuan go straight to the North Korean regime. These women are reportedly housed in a dormitory, under constant watch, although with their families back home as hostage, it would be difficult to escape. (A recent incident in which <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/08/asia/north-korea-restaurant-workers-defect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">13 North Koreans defected to South Korea</a> from a similar restaurant is an anomaly.) As the night wore on, the young women brought plastic floral bouquets to the men and urged them to come onstage, where they danced together holding hands in a daisy chain. Yu was on a first-name basis with many of the servers, who smiled at his bawdy jokes in that noncommittal way I have seen female workers in Pyongyang do with foreign men.</p><p>I repeated to Yu that I was a mere researcher, which I had hoped would make me seem harmless. There weren\u2019t many women like me hanging around the area, and on several occasions, I had been mistaken for a spy, either for the United States or South Korea. I was afraid that he would clam up if he drew such a conclusion. After a few North Korean Daedonggang beers, Yu began to talk about himself, but always with caution. His specialty, he said, was luxury Japanese goods. He owned a wholesale license in Japan and was able to obtain items at a low cost, which he then sold at retail to a Chinese buyer, who marked them up and sold them to a broker from North Korea. Only the transaction between the Chinese and North Korean was illegal. \u201cI get off scot-free,\u201d he said smugly. When I asked him what kind of goods, he said mostly diamonds, watches, and cosmetics. <a href=\"http://www.sk-ii.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-SKII-Site/default/Home-Show?&amp;cm_mmc=PPC-IP-GGL-_-SKII_Search_Brand+Awareness.Exact-_-Brand_General_Exact-_-sk%20ii_mkwid_srEbg7smN_78590811431_sk%20ii_e_c&amp;gclid=CLnlys6uwswCFVhZhgodEH0Lhw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SK II</a>, the high-end Japanese brand, was in big demand, he said. \u201cFace creams cost $200 a bottle and get sold out each time. Those wives of the party leaders are crazy about Japanese stuff and can never have enough.\u201d </p><p>I always looked for a chance to press Yu for details about his business, but when we met it was usually with one of his cronies, including a man called Boss Guk, a tall, bulky 43-year-old who claimed to be ethnic Chinese, born and raised in North Korea. One afternoon, when Guk went off to get us coffee, Yu said to me in a whisper, \u201cBe careful what you say before that guy. He\u2019s not like us. He\u2019s Chinese!\u201d That put a damper on any possibility of an open conversation, and I wondered if it was Yu\u2019s way of discouraging me from asking questions.</p><p>Yu said he had a wife and children back in Seoul although he lived mostly in Shenyang. Recently, though, he began renting an apartment in Dandong in a secret location that he used for meetings with VIPs. He cocked his head to suggest the other side of the border, meaning VIPs from North Korea. The building had multiple entrances, so one could enter and exit without being seen. One night after dinner, he invited me over to the apartment. As usual, Boss Guk came along, as did another man I had never met before. </p><p>Located at the back of an alley that reeked of fried food was a small two-bedroom apartment, bare except for a mattress on the floor and a beat-up sofa that appeared to have been found on the street. If there were several ways into the building I could not tell, but the one I used was so heavily garbage-strewn and graffiti-covered that it looked like a gateway to a dungeon rather than a residence. I hesitated for a moment before entering. It was not good, of course, for a lone female to walk into a strange apartment in a town like Dandong with a group of smugglers whom she barely knew. But nothing about this region was on the right side of safe. North Korea was murky, through and through, and exploring it had often brought me into yet murkier situations. Yu\u2019s tiny living room opened onto a kitchen area with a stove and a sink. Ignoring the sofa, I sat on the floor, while Yu brought out mugs and packets of South Korean instant coffee. Guk opened the refrigerator and took out cans of Asahi beer and a basketful of Japanese sweets. </p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-left\"><p>It was not good, of course, for a lone female to walk into a strange apartment in a town like Dandong with a group of smugglers whom she barely knew.</p></aside><p>Guk asked the third man, who sat quietly on the floor, how his travel plans to Germany were coming along, and the man said that he would be leaving in a few months. From the look of him\u2014small, gaunt, shabbily dressed, with eyes lowered\u2014it was hard to imagine that the trip was for leisure. Yu asked him about his family \u201cover there.\u201d As was the case with Guk, the man was ethnic Chinese from North Korea and still had family in the country. Because of his nationality, he was allowed to travel between China and North Korea. A trustworthy messenger was worth gold in this business, Yu later told me.</p><p>Yu and Guk chatted for a while in what seemed to be a code. There were several mentions of a \u201cgrandma\u201d and how difficult she was being. This grandma was hanging around longer than expected, and both Yu and Guk were getting increasingly anxious about it. When I asked whose grandma she was, Guk laughed and said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s our way of calling women in general, any woman past her twenties. This particular grandma is in her early forties, maybe in her late thirties, not sure, women are all the same after a certain age, and she sure is a pain in the ass.\u201d For a moment, I was afraid that he was talking about me, but soon it became apparent that this \u201cgrandma\u201d was a Korean woman who had flown in from Japan a couple of days ago, bringing with her something for sale, and rather than leaving it up to Yu to finalize the deal, she was waiting around to personally meet with the messenger from North Korea who was currently on his way over to Dandong.</p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed full-width\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/89972f9d596cff22e41cd2a220504e94596788ad.jpeg?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;0cede94b-c6e6-4dc5-bdd0-0131a96517b8&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;89972f9d596cff22e41cd2a220504e94596788ad&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:2756,&quot;height&quot;:1732,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/89972f9d596cff22e41cd2a220504e94596788ad.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"></figure><p>Yu lamented the unpredictability of his contacts. He and Guk began discussing how hard it was dealing with \u201cthem\u201d because they phoned infrequently and guaranteed no time of arrival. Even for these men, interactions with North Koreans was a test of patience. </p><p>What he was saying seemed eerily reminiscent of the current political climate. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/world/asia/north-korea.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">There had been no warning</a> when the North Korean government barred South Koreans from the Kaesong Industrial Complex; the factory owners had been quoted as saying that they had grown frustrated with such unprofessional behavior. I had also observed something similar in my relations with my North Korean students when I lived undercover in Pyongyang. The moment they seemed to open up, they inevitably retreated. It was no surprise, really. How could real relationships develop in a place where trust can lead to death and fear governs everything?\n</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>At night, the contrast was even starker. Both the city of Dandong and the Friendship Bridge were lit up like Christmas, as though the Chinese side were taunting its troubled neighbor across the river, where darkness fell, in near pitch black, as though no one lived there. Then I would wake up to face the bleak view, and a part of me wondered what I was hoping to find in this godforsaken place. Yet another part of me, an insistent voice inside, kept hanging on, hoping to gain another perspective of North Korea, which had become a siren call haunting the past decade of my obsession with it. Why Haruto-san left me alone with Yu was a mystery. Why Yu agreed to spend time with me was also odd, but he obliged, grumbling that he got stuck babysitting Haruto-san\u2019s friend. </p><p>One afternoon, Yu and I were eating Pyongyang <i><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/19/dining/19noodles.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">naengmyun</a></i>, a buckwheat noodle dish popular in both Koreas, and his phone kept ringing. He would answer only to discover that he had lost the signal. He explained that phone connections were always a problem here because North Korea broadcast noise on the same frequency as radio shortwaves to prevent unwanted foreign programs from reaching its people. When his phone rang again, he looked at it without picking up, and said that whoever was calling was frantically trying to get his hands on what he had in his backpack. He unzipped it to show me the inside filled with bundles of fresh $100 bills. \u201cThousands?\u201d I asked, and he chuckled as if pitying my na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201cMore like one hundred times that.\u201d </p><p>This was the only time Yu came to see me without Guk, and he told me his story. He was born 50 years ago in South Korea, he said, and became interested in North Korea in his youth. He had lived abroad in China and Thailand for the past two decades and supplied the South Korean government with information about North Korea for seven years. But some time during the mid-2000s, the South Korean national intelligence service brought him in for questioning, and tried to frame him as a spy. They needed a scandal to heighten the inter-Korean tension and chose to sacrifice him. He avoided arrest by threatening to expose them to his contacts in the Japanese media. Since then, he never stayed in South Korea for longer than a few days at a time. </p><p>People came to him looking for information about North Korea. Ninety percent of those were from corrupt defector aid groups that pretended to help rescue defectors but instead only pocketed aid money raised in the United States and South Korea. Then there were various governments, each offering him an average of $10,000 a month on retainer. When I asked if that was how much Haruto-san was paying him, he shook his head and mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m just a common merchant.\u201d </p><p>Yu claimed he preferred China to his native South Korea. There were no rules here, he said; it was a lawless world that gave breaks to men like him. Yet it had taken him years to find his footing in Dandong. People often had multiple alliances. They might have a link with the South Korean government, maybe Japan, maybe Russia, or maybe with the Chinese police. You never know, so you should always watch everything. Never assume anything.&nbsp; </p><p>With his apartment, he finally had an ideal setup; most deals took a lot of waiting. He once stayed in a motel in Donggang, a small port city about 20 miles southwest of Dandong, for nearly a year to recruit a contact. A large number of North Korean contract workers were sent to the Chinese factories there, and North Korean ships docked there regularly. When a ship came in, the crew came off the boat and went to a Korean store to stock up on food. Yu had courted the Korean-Chinese proprietor so that she would alert him when the crew arrived. Then he would rush over with a bag filled with cartons of Japanese cigarettes conspicuously sticking out. Not just any cigarette, but Seven Stars, which came in slim yellow packs sold only in Japan and at duty-free shops at Narita Airport. \u201cBut pay attention, this is important!\u201d Yu said impatiently, as though he were giving me a lesson on how to recruit North Korean sailors. \u201cNever approach them first\u2014let them approach you!\u201d Sure enough, after a few of these \u201cchance\u201d encounters, the captain of the ship ventured over to him, and asked where one might get hold of those Seven Stars. In order to gain his trust, Yu introduced himself as a Japanese businessman of Korean origin from Tokyo. The next time he came through, he could get the captain a few packs. They became friendly that way, and after months of bringing him cartons of Seven Stars, Yu knew that he could get the captain to do him some favors as well. </p><p>\u201cWhat favors?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Yu was vague as usual, but from the bits he said here and there, I gathered that the captain would contact a specific person in Pyongyang with a certain message. How could he be sure that this captain went to Pyongyang? \u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d he smiled. Yu made him carry a GPS so he could track him. This confirmed something Haruto-san once told me about their relationship: Yu helped him make contact with high-ranking officials in North Korea. </p><p>Then Yu, rather boastfully, began telling me he had been the first one to alert Haruto-san about <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/world/asia/kim-jong-il-is-dead.html?pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kim Jong-il\u2019s death</a> in December 2011. No one had any idea; in fact, even within North Korea, only a few people had been notified. But Yu figured out what was going on when a meeting with his North Korean contact, a high-ranking official, was abruptly canceled, and the official made a swift return home. Yu then telephoned Haruto-san, who immediately flew over from Japan to confirm, and thus it had been from his information network the Japanese government learned of Kim\u2019s death before anyone else. It was a cold winter, Yu said, as the two of them waited in Shenyang through Christmas for further news from within North Korea.</p><p>I was not sure how much of what he was telling me was true. But I was not being perfectly frank either. I did not share with him that I had been in Pyongyang on the day of Kim\u2019s death. People often asked me afterward what it was like in that moment, and I never knew how to explain or where to begin. I did indeed witness the darkness dawning on the face of every North Korean, as though they had just lost a parent or god, but my cover there had been as a teacher, and I was not allowed to leave my compound. I could only attest to what I was allowed to see, which is inevitably how one assesses one\u2019s experience of North Korea. </p><p>We met like this a few more times, with Guk accompanying Yu, over MSG-covered food. Soon I began to feel that even the water there tasted of MSG, and sometimes I wondered if MSG were the new opium for a billion Chinese. Yu always carried a backpack filled with cash bundles. Once he went off to the bathroom, leaving the backpack on the seat just as Guk stepped out for a cigarette, and I wondered if they were testing me. I still could not understand why Yu spent so much time with me, and each afternoon toward dinnertime, I worried that he might just not show up. One day, when I was told that the contents of the backpack added up to $70,000 and 900,000 Japanese Yen (roughly $8,000), I asked again what the money was for, and Yu shrugged and answered, in his cryptic way, that it wasn\u2019t for drugs but instead \u201csomething very sweet.\u201d Although he would not let me meet the grandma, a meeting between her and the messenger from North Korea finally seemed to have taken place, since she had left Dandong. To celebrate, Yu and Guk suggested a picnic.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>During the hourlong drive along the Yalu River, the radio picked up a North Korean broadcast. The program was an interview with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/31/world/asia/laos-north-korea-refugees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nine defectors who had recently been captured in Laos</a> and sent back to North Korea. The interviewer asked one of the defectors to explain how he had gotten out of the country. He answered that he had originally been kidnapped from North Korea by a South Korean Christian minister and his wife and had been held against his will in Dandong. If he failed to memorize and recite passages from the Bible he was beaten. One night, after two years of captivity, he was shoved into a car to be sold to South Korea, and it was with the solicitude of the Great Leader that he was rescued and returned home. The others repeated this story, and the interviewer said how miraculous it was that they had escaped the hell of such kidnappers. The entire time, they ranted against \u201cthat asshole bastard minister.\u201d </p><p>Yu laughed as he listened, and Guk pointed out that the program was for an international audience since defection was not a topic openly discussed within North Korea. The idea was to show the world that repatriated defectors were not executed or sent to a gulag, as was widely reported. Guk turned the radio off, and then stopped the car at a gas station and ran out to buy something. \u201cFor lunch,\u201d he said when he returned, holding up a small container of gasoline. </p><p>All around us were rolling hills, and our car veered off onto an unpaved side road, which ran downhill. We soon reached a small bridge over a dried-up riverbed full of rocks. It was a sunny afternoon, and there was a van parked there. In the shade beneath the bridge a group of men sat drinking cans of Tsingtao beer. A huge man, his head shaven and his bare chest covered in tattoos, looked up and shouted out something in Chinese. Guk waved as he opened the trunk and took out a crate. The bald man walked over, and together they carried the crate from the car and set it down in the shade. I watched them, wondering what might be inside the crate, but part of me felt afraid and did not want to know. Whatever it was, it appeared to be heavy. They gathered small stones and spread them out on the ground, then covered them with a hemp rice sack. Guk opened the crate and took out something that looked like a stone but turned out to be a clam the size of a child\u2019s fist. The crate was full of humongous clams. He stacked them vertically so that each one was propped up by stones beneath the cloth. They did this until there was a neat pile of clams over which Guk splattered gasoline; then he lit them all on fire. </p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed full-width\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/45e98a3104808c1d473218ffa3fdc906ea567b61.jpeg?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;f7008296-bb51-4473-b972-62b69e9498ec&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;45e98a3104808c1d473218ffa3fdc906ea567b61&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:2756,&quot;height&quot;:1732,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/45e98a3104808c1d473218ffa3fdc906ea567b61.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"></figure><p>\u201cNorth Korean clams roasted in a North Korean way!\u201d Yu shouted. He was seated on a rock next to the men, who were drinking silently and eating some sort of grilled meat. I asked Yu where these clams came from and who these men were, but he only said that they were Guk\u2019s friends and did not understand Korean so I should not pay them much attention. The blaze lasted only a brief while and died on its own, and Guk and the bald man brought over a pile of hot clams on a piece of cardboard. </p><p>\u201cThose guys are Chinese so they won\u2019t eat them cooked this way,\u201d Yu said, referring to our companions. Indeed, the men glanced over at the clams with curiosity but did not touch them. Guk explained that although he too is Chinese, he grew up in North Korea and used to cook clams like this with friends. Yu opened one and offered it to me, saying, \u201cIf you are researching North Korea, you better try it, since this is what they eat over there\u2014well, those who get to keep the clams they catch.\u201d </p><p>I did not see how I could refuse. Of course, it was not clear why we were nibbling on gasoline-bleeding clams under a bridge that seemed hardly a scenic spot for a picnic, surrounded by tough-looking men who could not be conversed with. The clams tasted leathery, without much flavor. I worried about some sort of cancer forming in my body with each bite. Both Yu and Guk kept exclaiming how delicious they were.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>The next morning, Yu was in the worst mood. The grandma had been stopped at Shenyang Airport and $90,000 was confiscated from her. Yu was furious since $20,000 of the cash was his, and it would take about two months of fighting with Chinese officials to get it back, minus a steep fine. The grandma had wrapped the cash in aluminum foil, which would increase the fine since it showed intent to conceal. Yu had told her never to do that, but she did not listen. I was not sure why she was carrying his share of the profit, but what was clear was that the woman was taking cash with her back to Japan, which seemed to suggest the money was a payment from North Korea for something she had sold. Yu and Guk both had to leave for Shenyang immediately to resolve the matter, but before taking off, Yu asked to speak to me in private. </p><p>\u201cYou are an amateur. Not even good enough to be an amateur!\u201d he said, meeting my eyes across the table in the lobby of my hotel. </p><p>At first I thought that he was so angry about the lost money that he had decided to take it out on me, but then I realized there must be another purpose to this sudden attitude shift. \u201cYou ask too many questions. In our world, the number one rule is not to act interested even if you are. You really should leave this game; it will only make you smaller and more pathetic the longer you stay, because you understand nothing about the players. Everyone\u2019s laughing at you. Even my guys are laughing at you.\u201d </p><p>He explained that the Chinese men under the bridge were the biggest gang members in the region, and the bald man with tattoos was so notorious that the moment he entered any restaurant, the place emptied instantly. Yu needed such men for protection. He had no time for someone like me, he said, but Haruto-san had asked him to look after his dearest friend. I knew by now that things here were said in codes, and that Yu was trying to tell me something. I was barely an acquaintance of Haruto-san, certainly not a dear friend, and Yu was a smuggler and would not be wasting time on me without a motive. It was as if he was trying to rile me up so I would finally show my hand. </p><p>\u201cYou are so mistaken if you think North Korea gives a shit about the American threat of sanctions,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat makes you Americans think that North Koreans are poor? Look, the person who came out the other day from Pyongyang is Boss Kim. She is part of the official delegation, carrying a diplomat visa, and drives a Benz and owns a high-rise pied-\u00e0-terre here in Dandong. Each time she comes out, she brings a load of cash to buy stuff for the Party leaders. Sometimes diamonds\u2014but only above one karat, costing at least a few tens of thousand dollars. Sometimes Ballantine whiskey, 30 years old\u2014but never from a duty-free shop; directly from Scotland. It costs double but they don\u2019t want anything made in some second-rate country\u2019s factories\u2014only Japanese stuff made in Japan, only French stuff made in France. Their leaders only want the top quality. The rich are richer over there since there\u2019s no labor cost, and things get done by just terrorizing people.\u201d</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\"><p>He showed me the inside filled with bundles of fresh $100 bills. \u201cThousands?\u201d I asked, and he chuckled as if pitying my na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201cMore like one hundred times that.\u201d</p></aside><p>The transaction between the grandma and Boss Kim, one from Japan and the other from North Korea, appeared to have taken place two days ago in Yu\u2019s secret apartment, after which the grandma left for Shenyang. But I had met neither of these women. I needed proof that they existed; otherwise, it was just a story. But I also knew that proof in this business came with a price tag. Yu was now tapping the table in exasperation. I could see that he had finally reached the point he had been leading up to. </p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m amazed by, though, is the fact that you have no idea. Your country has no idea. Everyone knows this except America. China knows, South Korea knows, Japan knows, but only America has no idea how North Korea works. Your country is being left seriously behind.\u201d </p><p>If this were a sales pitch, it was quite specific, and I recalled him quoting the $10,000 per month retainer. This, apparently, was the price for the United States to get back in the loop, which did not seem like such a bad deal. Except that I was not a spy, here to recruit him, as I now realized he believed. I was pondering this when he got up and said: </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a comedian I really admire in your country, and I would love his autograph because he\u2019s such a fine actor and is making all of us who know what\u2019s going on laugh constantly. He is so funny, making such bogus grand claims about the \u2018Korean problem\u2019 while doing absolutely nothing. Could you get me his autograph?\u201d He looked at me coyly and added, \u201cHis name is Barack Obama.\u201d</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>After Yu left, I stopped by Dandong\u2019s Korean Community Center to meet with the South Korean minister who had once warned me about coming here. When he heard about my time with Yu, he declared that I had narrowly escaped real danger. $90,000 is a lot of money, certainly too much for cosmetics. If the local Japanese-Korean merchant came herself to collect money and deliver, whatever it was must be small as well as significant, most likely weaponry components. Japan is known for supplying such things to North Korea, including <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-southkorea-gps-idUSKCN0X81SN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">GPS-jamming devices</a>, which could fit into a backpack. If one of Yu\u2019s men was off to Germany, it seemed likely that he was going there to acquire high-tech equipment. What reason could any of these men have for traveling to Germany for work if not to acquire something? In the world of Dandong smugglers, there are clear reasons for each destination: The U.K. suggests Rolls Royce and Rothman cigarettes. France means fine wine. Germany means high-tech parts. </p><p>As for the true identity of Yu and Guk, he had never heard of a South Korean in Dandong named Yu fitting such a description; but Guk he knew well, and he was no Chinese born in North Korea, but a Korean born in China. These men lie to convey legitimacy, he said; if you want to be in the business of selling North Korea, you have to pretend to know it better than others. </p><p>That night, my Air China flight out of Dandong was canceled, and I got stuck in a dismal motel near the airport, which resembled a rural Greyhound station. Since I spoke no Chinese, I relied on two fellow Korean-speaking passengers for updates on the flight. One of the men claimed to be Japanese, the other Chinese, both supposedly strangers to each other. The three of us ended up drinking beer while waiting. </p><p>I asked what brought them to Dandong, and why it happened that they were fluent in Korean. One pulled out his phone to show me a photograph of a painting of a mountain, very detailed and colorful. He said that he was an art dealer specializing in paintings from North Korea. The other man also used his phone to show me a photograph of what looked like ginseng root. This was, however, the much rarer <a href=\"http://www.koreatimesus.com/us-officials-crack-down-on-illegal-ginseng-harvesters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>sansam</i> root</a>, which normally grows to about five centimeters at most, but in North Korea is reputed to reach as tall as two meters and is believed to have healing properties for all manner of ailments. They sell for $10,000 a root, mostly to South Korean buyers. The next photograph was of a huge bullfrog. North Korea lacks industry, and therefore pollution, so things grow with no bounds, he said. These frogs sell for $15 each to Chinese clients, and he had a contact in North Korea who could get him an unlimited supply. \u201cHow about that, Miss America,\u201d he said, shoving the photo of the frog in my face. \u201cYou think maybe anyone in America might be interested in buying these natural North Korean Viagra?\u201d&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133036/across-broken-bridge</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133036</guid><category><![CDATA[June 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[North Korea]]></category><category><![CDATA[China]]></category><category><![CDATA[human smuggling]]></category><category><![CDATA[-homepage-top]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter-top]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Suki Kim]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/73628ffad992c76845bcdab8996edcf2c186d0ae.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Century of Conflicted, Complicated Motherhood in Art]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In Elena Ferrante\u2019s <i>Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay</i>, the narrator, a writer named\nElena Greco, has recently given birth to her first child.

Published by Rizzoli to coincide with a\nwell-received exhibition Gioni curated at Milan\u2019s Palazzo Reale last fall, the\nbook collects works by artists (male and female) who grappled with changing\ndefinitions of motherhood, tradition, and female power throughout the twentieth\ncentury. This is not a book filled with sweet, traditional depictions of\nmotherhood; like Ferrante\u2019s narrator, many of the female artists reckon with\nmotherhood as a role that could physically and mentally deter them from\ncreating art. Take, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.kunstforumwien.at/en/exhibition/kunstforum/201/meret-oppenheim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">M\u00e9ret Oppenheim</a>\u2019s 1931 <i>Votivhild (W\u00fcreengel)</i>\u2014in English, \u201cVotive picture (Strangling\nAngel)\u201d\u2014in which a woman with long, claw-like nails strangles a newborn child.\nGioni calls it \u201cthe most devastating image of the desire to escape from the\nsuffocation of tradition.\u201d&nbsp;<span>Oppenheim\nherself described the work as \u201ca sort of talisman to avoid getting pregnant so\nthat she could instead devote herself to art.\u201d&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Gioni\u2019s book</span><i>&nbsp;</i><span>looks at the ways this conflict has changed over the\npast hundred or so years, as expressed in works by modern and contemporary\nartists\u2014including Man Ray, Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman, and Catherine Opie.\nThe excellent reproductions are interspersed with essays by art historians and\ncurators that are sometimes dense and academic in tone, but on subjects\nfascinating and wide-ranging: Obscure Futurist-feminist manifestos, poems of\nlust and love, Dadaist machines, and what could be considered a queer reading\nof Duchamp fill the pages of </span><i>The Great\nMother</i><span>.</span></p><p>Some might wonder what right a man has to\ncurate an exhibit and book exploring these themes.

There is, for\ninstance, Edward Munch\u2019s 1899 lithograph \u201c<a href=\"http://www.edvardmunch.org/woman-in-three-stages.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Woman in Three Stages (Sphinx)</a>,\u201d in\nwhich three women stand in a line: The first wears a virginal white robe, the\nsecond stands frontally nude, and the third wears a somber black dress. The\nwomen represent three phases of female life\u2014virginity, sexuality and reproduction,\nand old age and death\u2014each determined by the woman\u2019s ability to reproduce. </p><p>Then there is American photographer Gertrude\nK\u00e4sebier\u2019s 1899 \u201c<a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/33.43.132/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blessed Art Thou Among Women</a>,\u201d a black and white portrait of a\nmother dressed in a long, angelic white dress with an arm around her young daughter.\nThe two stand in a hallway; behind them hangs a religious painting.

As Gioni notes, K\u00e4sebier was no straightforward traditionalist: The\nphotograph leaves out a father figure and focuses exclusively on the bond\nbetween a mother and her child, suggesting a maternal bond that subverts a\nconventional, patriarchal vision of the family.<i>&nbsp;</i></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Gioni\u2019s book and exhibition take their title\nfrom Berlin-born psychologist Erich Neumann\u2019s 1955 <i>Die Grosse Mutter</i>, or <i>The\nGreat Mother. </i>Neumann\u2019s study\u2014dedicated to his teacher, Carl Jung\u2014traced\nthe development and meaning of the \u201cGreat Mother\u201d archetype throughout time, a\nterm, Neumann writes, that refers \u201cnot to any concrete image existing in space\nand time, but to an inward image at work in the human psyche.\u201d In other words,\nthe \u201cGreat Mother\u201d is the mother figure of our myths, fantasies, and fears\u2014the woman\nwho can create, nurture, torment, or destroy us. </p><p>Many of the figures described and\nreproduced in <i>Die Grosse Mutter</i> were\ncollected by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Fr%C3%B6be-Kapteyn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olga Fr\u00f6be-Kapteyn</a>, an early-twentieth century Dutch scholar of\nEastern philosophy and Theosophy.

Take, for instance,\npainter, poet, and performer Mina Loy\u2019s 1914 polemic <i><a href=\"https://literarymovementsmanifesto.wordpress.com/text-2/mina-loy-feminist-manifesto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Feminist Manifesto</a></i>, in which the artist called for \u201cthe\nunconditional surgical destruction of virginity\u201d\u2014an extreme proposal, but one\nshe thought would free women from cultural pressures surrounding virginity, or\nwhat she called the \u201cfictitious value of woman as identified with her physical\npurity.\u201d Later, in the 1930s, German Dadaist <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Hannah-Hoch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hannah H\u00f6ch</a> would cut up images of\ntraditional male and female bodies and then collage them back together: babies\u2019\nsmiles covering men\u2019s faces on women\u2019s bodies and dancing ballerinas\u2019 legs. The\nphysical parts of a person are, in these collages, not essential to their\nidentity. </p><p>Come the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, female\nartists including Louise Bourgeois and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/ana-mendieta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ana Mendieta</a> would return to symbols of\ngoddesses and the natural world. Bodies were organically whole again, or at\nleast less fractured. For Bourgeois this meant <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/explore/collection/lb/themes/motherhood_family\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">round, bulging bronze sculptures</a>,\nand for Mendieta, \u201cearth-body sculptures,\u201d human\nsilhouette-shaped craters in the earth. The works are sensual and even seem to give\noff the smell of damp dirt.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p><i>The\nGreat Mother</i> is about the power to create: to create art, to create another\nperson, to create oneself. Often, these kinds of creation are at odds\u2014sometimes\nfor reasons similar to the conflicts between motherhood and any job: A person\ncan only have so much energy; there is only so much time in a day. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span>But Gioni\u2019s book is about another kind\nof creation, too: a new matrilineage of female artists across the\ntwentieth century. In 1980, art critic Lea Vergine curated </span><i>L\u2019altra met\u00e0 dell\u2019avanguardia</i><span> / </span><i>The\nOther Half of the Avant-Garde, 1910\u20131914</i><span>, the first Italian art show to\ngive a history of modern art from a female perspective. Unlike other surveys of\nfemale artists in the 1970s, Vergine\u2019s approach was to present the female\nartists as if they belonged in art history all along. \u201cI must say that I\nrealized\u2026that I had always treated female artists in the same way as males.\u201d</span><br></p><p><i>The\nGreat Mother </i>picks up\nthis remit, leaving personal testimony to the artworks.

But his erratic, \u201cI\u2019ll say anything\u201d persona\ncould be more of a liability than a boon in the general election. In the coming\nmonths, Hillary Clinton and her allies will do everything in their power to\npaint Trump as dangerously unhinged. They got started on Wednesday, just hours after Ted\nCruz abandoned the race and cleared the way for Trump to become the nominee, releasing\na witty, highly shareable&nbsp;<a href=\"/minutes/133305/hillary-clinton-makes-attacking-trump-look-easy\">video</a> that shows prominent Republicans like Mitt Romney calling\nhim a \u201ccon artist,\u201d \u201cphony,\u201d \u201cbully,\u201d and \u201cthe most vulgar person to ever\naspire to the presidency.\u201d</p><p>Trump needs to\nshow that he has a softer and more rational side, and he\u2019s been assuring\nsupporters\u2014and skeptical Republicans\u2014that he can, and will. But there\u2019s a\nhitch, as he well knows: The more Trump sounds like a traditional politician,\nthe more he risks losing the fervent support of people who like him because he\u2019s\nanything <i>but </i>a traditional\npolitician.</p><p>Trump is clearly\nconflicted about all this. Two weeks ago, at a rally in a Connecticut\ngymnasium, he addressed the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-im-not-going-to-blow-it-1461200705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> that he was planning to become a more decorous, disciplined\nfigure on the campaign trail. \u201cI can do presidential, folks. Believe me,\u201d Trump\n<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-says-he-doesnt-toning-down-rhetoric-amid-calls-be-n561026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">told</a> the crowd that had gathered in Waterbury. But then he\nstraightened his shoulders, gazed mockingly into the distance, and told the\ntruth: \u201cI sort of don\u2019t like toning it down.\u201d</p><p>Since then, Trump\nhas continued to ridicule his rivals on the campaign trail.&nbsp;<span>\u201cIn the case of Lyin\u2019 Ted Cruz. Lyin\u2019 Ted. Lies. Ooh, he lies. You know Ted. He brings the Bible, holds it high, puts it down, lies,\u201d</span><span>&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/trump-ted-cruz-lying-222226#ixzz47nwE7fBW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a><span>\nat a rally in Indianapolis late last month. But he&nbsp;</span><i>has</i><span> begun to tone it down in his\ncampaign ads. The television spots Trump rolled out in Indiana this past week,\nprior to the primary win that clinched his nomination, could not have been more\nconventional\u2014or, frankly, more boring.</span></p><p>The <a href=\"/political-ad-database/donald-trump-washington-is-broken/NC8yMS8xNjpXYXNoaW5ndG9uIElzIEJyb2tlbg\">first</a> shows Trump in his Manhattan office, with skyscrapers\nlooming in the background and traffic inching along on the street below. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut taxes for the middle class, negotiate new\ntrade deals, bring back jobs, save Social Security and Medicare without cuts,\nend illegal immigration, build the wall, strengthen our military, knock out\nISIS, and take care of our great veterans,\u201d Trump says as upbeat music swells\nbehind him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make America great again.\u201d</p><p>Granted,\nManhattan is an unconventional backdrop for a political ad. As I wrote several weeks\nago, politicians most often use New York City as <a href=\"/article/132499/new-york-campaign-ads-tale-two-cities\">a symbol for corporate greed and excess</a>. But otherwise, the Trump spot is straight out\nof a mainstream playbook: He\u2019s one more politician talking directly and soberly to the camera for a\nfull 30 seconds.</p><p><a href=\"/political-ad-database/donald-trump-my-dad/NC8yMS8xNjpNeSBEYWQ\">His second ad</a> presents the softer side of Trump\u2014sort\nof\u2014with his eldest son talking adoringly about his dad. \u201cGrowing up, my brother, sister, and I had to really\nknow what we were talking about before bringing him any kind of proposal,\u201d\nDonald Trump Jr. says as the commercial cuts to a photo of his father smooching one\nof his grandsons. \u201cHe may be a little less tough on his grandchildren right\nnow, but it\u2019s that toughness that I want renegotiating trade deals with China\nand Mexico. It\u2019s that toughness that I want keeping me and my family and your\nfamily safe.\u201d</p><p>These ads may go\na little way toward dispelling the notion that Trump is an egomaniacal tyrant who\nshould never be trusted with the nuclear codes. <i>Progress!</i> But they also dilute the persona Trump has built up for\nhimself\u2014as an outsider who eschews political orthodoxy and the Washington\ncartel\u2014because they employ the same tactics that conventional politicians have\nbeen using for years. &nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s easy to see\nwhy the Trump campaign is trying to steer in a \u201csafer\u201d direction. How, after\nall, does he woo the skeptical voters he\u2019ll need to beat Clinton without\nconvincing them that he can be at least reasonably \u201cpresidential\u201d? But if the\nIndiana ads signal the campaign\u2019s strategy going forward, there\u2019s a risk that\nit could backfire\u2014and not just because he may lose fervent supporters who like\nthe unhinged, non-traditional version of Trump.</p><p>Throughout the\ncampaign so far, Trump has had an almost supernatural ability to deflect\ncriticism on the campaign trail, because he could say: <i>I\u2019m a Washington outsider. Naturally, the Republican elite is going to\ngang up on me. Just ignore them. They\u2019re lying, like all politicians. </i>But the\nmore he adopts the mainstream Washington playbook in his ads\u2014and in the rest of his campaign\u2014the more he looks\nlike a political insider himself. That\u2019s when he has to watch out, because that\nwill make him just as susceptible to criticism as the average politician.</p><h2>THIS WEEK\u2019S ADS:&nbsp;</h2><figure class=\"article-embed\"><style type=\"text/css\"> .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout { border: 1px solid lightgray; position: relative; overflow: hidden; } .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout h4.interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-rubric { margin-top: 1.5em; font-size: 1em; font-weight: 500; text-transform: uppercase; } .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout h3.interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-dek { font-weight: 400; font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 0.3em; } .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout h2.interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-hed { margin-top: 0; display: inline-block; border-bottom: 2px solid white; } .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-link { display: block; overflow: hidden; background: none !important; } .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-link:hover h2 { border-bottom-color: #6ec9e7; } .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout h4.interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-rubric, .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout h3.interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-dek, .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-hed { margin-right: 15px; margin-left: 15px; } @media only screen and (min-width: 1100px) { .article-embed:not(.pull-right):not(.pull-left) .interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout img.interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-img { float: right; width: 50%; max-width: 50%; } } </style> <aside class=\"interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout\"> <a href=\"/political-ad-database\" class=\"interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-link\"> <img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/6a4b14b500b24ea23f4450ffa76a9ae748c80301.jpeg?w=600&amp;q=60\" class=\"interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-img\"> <h4 class=\"interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-rubric\">New Republic Interactive</h4> <h2 class=\"interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-hed\">2016 Campaign Ad Archive</h2> <h3 class=\"interactive-campaign-ad-db-callout-dek\">The 2016 presidential candidates and their super PACs are expected to spend billions on TV ads this election\u2014and we've compiled every single one.</h3> </a> </aside></figure><p><span>Most of the new ads that aired this week were in Indiana, as Ted Cruz mounted a last-ditch effort to stop Donald Trump before Tuesday\u2019s primary.&nbsp;</span><span>Below, we\u2019ve analyzed&nbsp;four</span><b>&nbsp;</b><span>new ads that aired this week.

And that active agenda is comprehensive.</p><p>On the current leadership security agenda, for example, is establishing peace in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36183569\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Syria</a>, ensuring stability in Europe in the face of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36197856\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Russian aggression</a>, and supporting freedom of navigation in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36057358\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">South China Sea</a>. All this is done in the name of global stability, and promoting the\u2014sometimes contested\u2014American version of <a href=\"http://www.inquisitr.com/2993568/human-rights-2015-report-released-john-kerry-says-abuse-spawns-terrorism-video/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">human rights.</a></p><p>To this could be added a multitude of economic agenda issues, like promoting trade agreements in Asia and Europe.</p><p>Washington\u2019s politicians generally regard promoting global free trade as sacrosanct, although both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have questioned that assumption in recent months, as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ7kn2-GEmM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ross Perot</a> did in 1992. But the fact is that presidents from both parties have occasionally invoked \u201c<a href=\"http://millercenter.org/president/bush/speeches/speech-5526\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">free and fair trade</a>\u201d measures\u2014code words for protectionism. Even Ronald Reagan, Republican doyen, <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ronald_Reagan_Free_Trade.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">used them</a> in textiles and cars to safeguard jobs and win votes in the 1980s.</p><p>Second, this orthodoxy accepts that America has to pay a price in blood and treasure for its global role.</p><p>That price takes several forms. There is, above all, the cost of military intervention in protecting vulnerable populations (think of the <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/8/5982421/yazidis-yezidis-iraq-crisis-bombing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yazidis</a> in Iraq) or in upholding American national security (<a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/event/Afghanistan-War\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the invasion of Afghanistan</a>).</p><p>And the same is true when it comes economic policy. America has acted as a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lenderoflastresort.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lender of last resort</a>\u201d in time of crisis. It has underwritten <a href=\"https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/chinas-new-investment-bank-premature-prophecy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the global economic system</a> with the world\u2019s two key financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, headquartered in Washington, D.C.</p><h2>The Washington playbook</h2><p>President Obama has, at times, departed from this orthodoxy, or what he recently termed \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/obama-doctrine-washington-playbook/473058/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Washington playbook</a>.\u201d </p><p>He has <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/kerry-defends-obama-syria-putin-meeting-377928\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">refused</a> to commit large-scale combat troops to the war in Syria and Iraq or to do more to protect <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-us-ukraine-20150214-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ukraine</a>. Similarly, Obama\u2019s rapprochement with Cuba and the Iranian nuclear deal have both breached the contours of routine foreign policy.</p><p>On his recent trip to Europe, Obama <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/25/remarks-president-obama-address-people-europe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">made it clear that European governments</a> need to contribute more to the cost of NATO in the spirit of the organization\u2019s agreement about burden-sharing. All presidents in recent times have asked the Europeans to spend more. But none have been as forthright.</p><p>Clinton and Obama have disagreed at times. She has suggested, for example, that America should play a more significant role in Syria <a href=\"http://cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/clinton-differs-administration-syria-no-fly-zone-arming-kurds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">by imposing a no fly zone and arming the Kurds</a>. But like Obama, <a href=\"http://correctrecord.org/hillary-clinton-smart-power-foreign-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clinton focuses more</a> on a balanced use of diplomacy, sanctions, development, and firepower than some presidential predecessors, such as George W. Bush.</p><p>Still, whatever marginal differences there are between Clinton and Obama, both have largely worked within the contours of American foreign policy orthodoxy. Their differences pale in comparison to those between Trump and Clinton.</p><h2>Tearing up the playbook</h2><p>Donald Trump wants to tear up the playbook. His worldview is a trajectory begins with assumptions more common in the world of business than of foreign policy. He wants to broker the best deal. This approach takes three forms.</p><ol><li>Like a negotiator, Trump favors mystique and keeping information \u201cclose to his chest\u201d over transparency. So he has a plan to defeat ISIS \u201c<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-isis-foreign-policy-speech-us-election-2016-a7004371.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">very, very quickly</a>\u201d through an \u201c<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-foreign-policy-speech-5-contradictions-in-the-presidential-hopefuls-plan-a7005711.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">unpredictable</a>\u201d strategy. But he is not sharing it with the rest of us because that would give away a strategic advantage.</li><li>Like any businessman (or shopper), Trump values getting the \u201cbest bang for the buck.\u201d So he will <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-isis-foreign-policy-speech-us-election-2016-a7004371.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reform the military</a> so that it is more efficient. And he will get our current clients to pay for their protection\u2014in Asia and Europe. The <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/donald-trumps-big-foreign-policy-speech-was-mess\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ultimatum is clear</a>: \u201cThe countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves\u2026We have no choice.\u201d So the illusion of \u201cburden-sharing\u201d is over. The U.S. will withdraw its military support from organizations such as NATO if not suitably rewarded, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN0XO10R\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">much to the alarm of its allies</a>. And China will have to share the load as well, and stop \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36185012\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">raping</a>\u201d the American economy.</li><li>And, finally, in the market, your collaborator can instantly become your competitor. So, engaging with countries Trump regards as our \u201cfrenemies\u201d\u2014such as Mexico or some Muslim and Arab countries\u2014as if America owes them something is over. They, like our European and Asian allies, will have to prove their worth rather than relying unconditionally on American support.</li></ol><p>Paradoxically, it is some of our competitors that will have a far better time of it.</p><p>Vladimir Putin <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/28/politics/donald-trump-russia-putin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">praised</a> Trump\u2019s recent foreign policy speech. That added to their prior mutual compliments suggests a friendship is blossoming. Trump\u2019s view of Putin is reminiscent of George W. Bush\u2019s statement in 2001 when he suggested that he looked into Putin\u2019s eyes and decided he was \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d</p><p>Former Ambassador Nicholas Burns summarized his concerns about Trump\u2019s newfound approach last week. Commenting on Trump\u2019s speech, Burns <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/analyzing-trumps-tough-talking-foreign-policy-speech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I think it\u2019s naive to think you can sit down with Vladimir Putin and negotiate the future of Europe.</p><p>President Obama and President Bush before him dealt with Putin from a position of strength. We now have sanctions against Putin because he crossed the brightest red line in international police. He invaded another country and took over its territory. There was nothing in the speech about that.</p><p>There was very little in the speech about Chinese assertiveness in East Asia. And I think, Judy, the thing that bothered me the most about this speech, the lack of humility. Donald Trump castigated 35 years of American foreign policy. That includes George H.W. Bush. It includes Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.</p></blockquote><h2>Things will get worse before they get better</h2><p>The upcoming presidential election process is likely to be as nasty as the Republican primary has been.</p><p>So, if you have had a hard time explaining the last six months to your foreign friends, the likelihood is that the next six are going to get harder.</p><p>But foreigners, from Mexico City to Moscow, appreciate what is at stake. After all, they too will bear the consequences of the choices of American voters.</p><p>The Washington playbook has its problems. Arguably it does need to be torn up. The abiding question is whether this is the way to do it.</p><p>It will be ironic if, in retrospect, history judges President Obama\u2019s deviations from the playbook as merely setting the stage for the foreign policy upheaval that followed.</p><p><img alt=\"The Conversation\" height=\"1\" src=\"//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/58715/count.gif\" width=\"1\"></p><p><i>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://theconversation.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Conversation</a>.

He seems to be a weak general election\ncandidate, but liberals conditioned to expect the worst may start to look for\nreasons why he\u2019s stronger than he appears. Certainly, Trump\u2019s victory over a\ndeep slate of Republican rivals is evidence that we would be foolish to write\nhim off too quickly. But when all is said and done, the impulse reaction is the correct\none: Donald Trump is a very poor general election candidate and a massive\nunderdog to win the keys to the White House.</p><aside id=\"signal-133322\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>A qualification should be noted at the outset.\nIt would be wrong to say that Trump is \u201cunelectable.\u201d Given the partisan\nconfiguration of the country, it is <i>possible</i>\nfor any major party candidate to win. Both parties start out with enough safe\nstates that they can win under the right conditions. It\u2019s also worth noting that Hillary Clinton\u2019s\nhigh unfavorable ratings suggest that she is a weaker candidate than Barack\nObama. Against a generic Republican candidate, she could well be at a\ndisadvantage.</p><p>So it\u2019s not literally impossible for Trump to win. Still, it\nwould be a big upset\u2014maybe not Leicester City winning the Premier League big,\nbut big. </p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\"><p>Barring economic catastrophe, a poor candidate for the Republicans is like handing an anvil to a mountain climber; they can\u2019t really afford even a modest negative impact.</p></aside><p>The fundamental problem for the Republicans is that they\u2019re\nalready at a structural disadvantage in the Electoral College. The last six\npresidential elections have resulted in four very comfortable Democratic\nvictories, a virtual tie resolved by the Supreme Court, and a narrow win by a\nwartime Republican incumbent in a decent economy\u2014and George W. Bush was still less\nthan 200,000 votes in Ohio away from a loss.&nbsp;\nThe higher turnouts of presidential elections work against the GOP, and\nchanging demographics are only making the problem worse. Barring economic\ncatastrophe, a poor candidate for the Republicans is like handing an anvil to a\nmountain climber; they can\u2019t really afford even a modest negative impact.</p><p>And the negative effects of Trump might be more than modest.\nWe can start with the fact that outside his core of supporters virtually nobody\nlikes him. Hillary Clinton is given a \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d rating <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/2/11565194/clinton-trump-unfavorable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">by\nupwards of 40 percent</a> of voters, easily breaking the previous record of a\nmajor party nominee set by Bush in 2004. But Trump blows that out of the water; he is viewed\nvery unfavorably <i>by a majority of voters</i>.\nAdmittedly, his unfavorable rating should come down as Republican-leaning\nvoters who didn\u2019t vote for him in the primary start to come around. But the\nsame will be true of Sanders-supporting Democrats when they begin to consider the prospect of a Trump inauguration. Clinton will also have a major asset in\nappealing to unenthused Democrats\u2014an <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">increasingly\npopular</a> President Obama campaigning on behalf of his former secretary of state.\nTrump has already gotten a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/05/05/george-w-bush-trump-former-presidents/83962432/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">definitive cold shoulder</a> from the last two\nRepublican presidents.</p><p>We can also at least tentatively consider head-to-head\npolls. As Princeton\u2019s Sam Wang <a href=\"http://election.princeton.edu/2016/05/01/what-do-head-to-head-general-election-polls-tell-us-about-november/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">explains</a>,\ngeneral election matchup polls start to have some predictive value as early as\nFebruary. (Every election is different, but given how long Hillary Clinton and\nDonald Trump have been public figures, these polls could, if anything, be a more reliable indicator of future results than usual.) And this is\nexcellent news for Democrats. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">average\npoll</a> gives Clinton a 6.5-point edge. Based on past historical trends, Wang\nestimates that \u201cthe probability that Trump can catch up by November is 9\npercent, and the probability that Clinton will remain ahead of Trump is 91\npercent.\u201d A one-in-ten chance of a President Trump is still a little scary, but\nDemocrats have to like those odds.</p><p>Still, while head-to-head polls have some predictive value,\nit\u2019s important to be careful about overstating their importance. After all,\nsome polls have indicated that Clinton is leading Trump in Utah. More than the\npolls, it\u2019s the electoral map that makes it difficult to see Trump prevailing.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with one state: Florida. It is enormously\ndifficult to see any path for Republican victory that doesn\u2019t include the\nSunshine State. But it is very difficult to see Trump, who is likely <a href=\"/article/132174/democrats-shouldnt-fret-high-gop-turnout\">to\nboth mobilize</a> a higher-than-usual minority turnout and fare even worse\namong such voters than Mitt Romney, winning a state that was roughly 40 percent\nAfrican-American and Hispanic as of the 2010 Census\u2014a percentage that is almost\ncertainly higher in 2016. For what it\u2019s worth, the <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/05/04/six-months-out-the-general-election-map-looks-tough-for-donald-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">early\npolling</a> shows Clinton clobbering Trump in Florida. &nbsp;</p><p>Trump\u2019s weakness with minority voters and educated\nprofessionals will also mean that he\u2019s nearly drawing dead in increasingly blue\nVirginia, and he may well be an underdog in North Carolina as well. Losing all\nthree states would essentially foreclose a Republican win.</p><p>Even assuming that Clinton merely holds Florida and Virginia,\nit\u2019s not clear how Trump can win. He would have to have unusual success in the\nupper Midwest, but this is probably Republican wishful thinking.</p><p>If Trump loses Florida and Virginia, even winning Ohio,\nWisconsin, and Pennsylvania wouldn\u2019t put him over the top. Adding Michigan would\ndo it, but contrary to some assumptions, Michigan is <i>not</i> a swing state. Obama won it in 2012 by nearly 10 points against a\nquasi-native son Republican candidate, and that was in much worse economic\ncircumstances and before Governor Rick Snyder drowned his party\u2019s brand in the\nFlint River. Trump is not going to carry it. You would also have to be an\nextremely optimistic Republican to think Trump could capture the relatively\ndiverse and urban state of Pennsylvania for the GOP for the first time since a\nmuch more moderate Republican carried it by less than two points in a landslide\nelection in 1988.&nbsp; </p><p>After 2012, many Republicans were aware that the country\u2019s\ndemographics were tilting against them in presidential elections. Nominating\nDonald Trump perversely exacerbates these problems rather than alleviating\nthem. This doesn\u2019t guarantee a win for Hillary Clinton, but it does make it\noverwhelmingly likely.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133322/dont-overthink-it-donald-trump-will-probably-lose</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133322</guid><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter-top]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Lemieux]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 15:16:49 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/c8f294ebcec66164fc291c1b5a50cdd608c9f132.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Free-Trade Consensus Is Dead]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><span>Speaking on Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman made a familiar argument. The Obama administration has used trade agreements to reshape globalization in the best way, he said. We\u2019ve put labor and environmental standards at the core of the deals, he claimed, and we\u2019ve created a level playing field for U.S. workers. </span><br></p><aside id=\"signal-133310\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Froman\u2019s timing was unfortunate. The same day, documents <a href=\"https://ttip-leaks.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">leaked by Greenpeace Netherlands</a> revealed that U.S. negotiators working on a trade deal with the European Union have actually been pressuring their trading partners to lower those same standards.</p><p><span>This distance between Froman\u2019s words and the contradictory reality</span><b> </b><span>is at the heart of the disintegration of the global trade consensus. The 2016 presidential election has focused heavily on trade agreements, and the leading basher of them is now the Republican nominee for president. We\u2019re seeing something similar on the Democratic side: You can argue that Hillary Clinton has not moved on any major issue as much as she has </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/29/how-hillary-clintons-positions-have-changed-while-running-against-bernie-sanders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">moved on trade agreements</a><span>, publicly opposing a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement she enthusiastically promoted as secretary of state. </span></p><p><span>In short, the center of gravity holding together a policy framework that prioritizes corporate dominance over democratic governance has collapsed. And this week\u2019s leak is another nail in the free-trade coffin. </span></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>The leaked documents show current negotiating positions for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a deal between the U.S. and the EU, the world\u2019s largest common market. The two sides have been locked in negotiations since 2013; the thirteenth round of talks ended last week in New York.</p><p>Like most modern trade deals, TTIP has less to do with tariffs than with so-called \u201cnon-tariff trade barriers,\u201d a euphemism for ordinary health, safety, environmental, and financial regulations that corporations want to weaken both at home and abroad. In democratic societies, the people usually decide the balance between protecting the public and satisfying commerce. But TTIP\u2019s goal is to eliminate trade barriers, even if the public prefers them, to facilitate the smooth movement of corporate capital. This prevents future governments from operating in the public interest if it harms business in any fashion.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\"><p>When defenders claim that trade agreements will increase prosperity for all instead of a few well-connected corporate interests, people no longer believe them.</p></aside><p>The EU routinely <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/ttip-texts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">makes its TTIP negotiating positions public</a>; until this leak, the U.S. positions were a secret. That this leak is so up-to-date suggests someone on the inside, unhappy with the state of the talks, decided to go public. And it\u2019s easy to understand why: In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/01/leaked-ttip-documents-cast-doubt-on-eu-us-trade-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">virtually every instance</a> in the negotiations, the U.S. has preferred less-stringent constraints on corporations to the EU\u2019s tougher stances.</p><p>The U.S. negotiators complained about the European ban on animal testing in cosmetics, calling it an \u201cirreconcilable\u201d difference that would cripple market access. They proposed pre-empting restrictions Europe maintains on genetically modified organisms, euphemistically referring to them as \u201cproducts of modern agricultural technology.\u201d They sought a dispute-mechanism process for food safety and pesticides that would outsource decision-making to a UN organization, where corporate executives often sit on the national delegations and where rulings have typically been more lax than those from the EU.</p><p>The documents also show that the U.S. wants to change the entire EU rulemaking process. In a chapter entitled \u201cRegulatory Cooperation,\u201d U.S. negotiators proposed that the EU inform American companies of planned regulations in advance, giving them an opportunity to influence the rules. They want the EU to limit regulations to those least burdensome to business, and seek out \u201calternatives to achieve the appropriate level of protection\u201d without a new rule. They would require the EU to take into account the trade effects of regulations; that means that if regulations banning a hazardous chemical would stop a corporation from selling a product containing it in the EU, the European Parliament would have to give those market considerations as much weight as safeguarding public health before approving the rule.</p><p><span>The regulatory proposal would also add layers of bureaucracy and detailed \u201cimpact assessments\u201d\u2014the kinds of cost-benefit analysis Washington habitually uses to stop regulations cold. In fact, just a few weeks ago the Obama administration </span><a href=\"/article/132510/judge-became-sheriff-wall-street\">argued against including a cost-benefit analysis</a><span> in determining whether financial institutions posed a systemic risk to the economy\u2014because it\u2019s too subjective, burdensome, and biased in favor of corporations. Now its trade negotiators want to mandate the same analysis for Europe.</span><span> </span></p><p>A \u201cscience and risk\u201d provision is even more explicit: No prohibitions on products should be implemented, the U.S. demands, without scientific proof that the products are harmful, rather than as a precautionary measure. This is a higher regulatory burden than current EU practice, and would result in overturning several of its laws.</p><p>Finally, in this agreement to remove barriers to trade, the U.S. is also threatening protectionist measures to achieve its goals. In one section, negotiators commit to authorizing exports of liquefied natural gas to the EU, a major user of that energy source. However, the <a href=\"http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2016/05/sierra-club-statement-leaked-transatlantic-trade-deal-text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sierra Club points out</a> that, in a separate note, the U.S. holds back on that promise unless it can obtain further concessions. Washington is running the same gambit on permitting imports of European cars, seeking higher quotas for its agricultural exports. </p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p><span>The TTIP leak provides more fuel for a growing movement against global trade agreements, particularly in Europe, where public sentiment</span><b> </b><span>was already </span><a href=\"https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/topics/aktuelle-meldungen/2016/april/in-deutschland-und-den-usa-waechst-die-skepsis-gegenueber-ttip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">running heavily</a><span> against the deal. Just yesterday, even after the EU\u2019s trade minister Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m called the leak insignificant, France\u2019s trade minister </span><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36191577\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">determined</a><span> that the talks were now \u201clikely to stop\u201d altogether. </span></p><p>Froman chose not to address the leak in Los Angeles on Monday. But Assistant Trade Representative<b> </b>Matthew McAlvanah did some damage control, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/world/europe/ttip-greenpeace-leak-trade-deal.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">telling <i>The New York Times</i></a> that TTIP would \u201cpreserve, not undermine, our strong consumer, health, and environmental standards.\u201d It\u2019s hard to square that with the leaked texts, which expose how officials seek to bully the EU into capitulation with a corporate-friendly agenda.</p><p>But the greater importance of the leak is the way it exposes this mismatch between America\u2019s public and private stances\u2014not just on TTIP, but on all trade deals. In public, for instance, officials claim the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) raises labor standards; in private, the agreement <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/01/tpp-mexico-labor-rights/426501/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">does not force Mexico</a> to commit to such improvements. In public, Froman said Monday that we cannot allow China to write the rules for global trade; in private, the U.S. is <a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/job-killing-trade-deal-you%E2%80%99ve-never-heard-china-bilateral-investment-treaty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">actively negotiating</a> a bilateral investment treaty with the Chinese, collaborating with them in writing those rules. And in public, Froman warns about the cost of delay and the geopolitical risk of inaction\u2014but he quietly acknowledged on Monday that \u201ctrade plays a relatively small role in our economy.\u201d The meager benefits come at the expense of disallowing countries to operate in the interests of their citizens.</p><p>I\u2019ll acknowledge a certain amount of demagoguery about trade, particularly from the Republican nominee, who wants to supplant bullying other countries on behalf of business with bullying them on behalf of Donald Trump. But there\u2019s no question that economic anxieties across the political spectrum have been channeled into trade policy, and even once-supportive economists like <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/a-protectionist-moment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paul Krugman</a> have grown more skeptical that you can compensate the workers who lose out to global competition. Ham-handed defenses of the trade agenda from those who conceal their true aims don\u2019t help the case.</p><p>While some free traders don\u2019t believe in the sincerity of Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/full-interview-hillary-clinton-trade-pact-doubts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">public stance</a> against TPP (perhaps because she\u2019s said nothing about TTIP), and hope her election would signal a return to the<b> </b>status quo, I tend to think the bipartisan shift on trade reflects the popular will. What\u2019s changed is that when defenders claim that trade agreements will increase prosperity for all instead of a few well-connected corporate interests, people no longer believe them. And they have nobody to blame but themselves.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133310/free-trade-consensus-dead</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133310</guid><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Trade]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[David Dayen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 14:16:03 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/37b136fad5dc937844509a279e307491ac165691.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Flaws of Do-Gooder Food Ratings   ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows you should be watching what you eat. But how exactly do\nyou watch the people who grew and packaged it? How do you trust that the food\nyou buy meets the ever-growing list of requisites for a right-minded shopper?\nNot just the right kind of fats <a href=\"http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/ideally-many-grams-fat-should-consume-daily-5501.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">in the right proportion</a> but also low sodium,\norganic, GMO-free, with no added sugars or<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelhennessey/2012/08/27/living-in-color-the-potential-dangers-of-artificial-dyes/#11d46ecc3213\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> artificial colors </a>or whatever has\nbeen high on your nutritional priorities lately.

Once you start, it\u2019s hard to stop. How to keep track\nof everything you want in the way your food is produced? Check the backs of\nfood boxes and cans and you\u2019ll encounter a fairly limitless mystery of symbols\nand marks and scores (<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/grocery-labels-for-do-gooders-1432893602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">around 350 potential certifications</a>, according to one\nestimate). It\u2019s exhausting just to think about. </p><aside id=\"signal-133024\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>HowGood, a company that wants to put seals of approval on supermarket\nshelves all across the land, tries to do that work for you. It <a href=\"https://howgood.com/#!/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">evaluates\nproducts </a>by 70 \u201cindicators,\u201d or criteria, that have very little to do with\nnutrition and everything it can think of to do with sustainability, fairness,\nfood justice, and environmental and worker safety. It covers more than 170,000\nproducts so far, using data from hundreds of publicly available sources and\nalso from seven researchers working in a purple barn in upstate New York, who\npick up the phone to ask manufacturers questions they can\u2019t find the answers to\non the web. </p><p>It has an app, yes. Everybody has an app. But nobody uses apps to scan\ncodes to see what went into a product on a shelf. Companies like to make\n<a href=\"http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Manufacturers/Label-Insight-SmartLabel-is-not-just-about-QR-codes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">promises of transparency with bar codes and QR codes</a>, knowing full well that\nconstantly rushed consumers are almost certain not to bother to train a phone\ncamera on a code, hold still to snap a picture, and wait for the results to\nshow up. (Food manufacturers who don\u2019t want GMO labeling say they\u2019ll put all\nthe information anyone could want in codes: <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/labels-for-gmo-foods-are-a-bad-idea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why distract consumers </a>with yet one\nmore piece of complicated information on a label? Let them find the scanner app\non their phone and figure out how it works.)</p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed figure-active\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/29c3b385a5870120cd986fd87bb803e3406217db.jpeg?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;271b641b-18f3-4d18-984d-8edfb35e05cd&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;29c3b385a5870120cd986fd87bb803e3406217db&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;height&quot;:1200,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/29c3b385a5870120cd986fd87bb803e3406217db.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"><figcaption><span class=\"credit\">Justyna Stasik</span></figcaption></figure><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Cynical or not, the unlikelihood of consumers using apps and the\ndifficulty of making money from them explains why there are few well-known\nrivals to HowGood on the market. Perhaps the best-known, <a href=\"http://www.shopwell.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ShopWell</a>, is mostly\nfor helping with diet choices (\u201ca personal nutritionist in your pocket!\u201d the\niTunes downloads page claims). Naomi Starkman, a founder and the\neditor-in-chief of the invaluable web site Civil Eats, has been spending the\nacademic year as a John S. Knight fellow at Stanford, researching whether\nmillennials who call themselves food\u2014focused actually use their phones while\nshopping. The results of her early research? They don\u2019t. But they don\u2019t trust\ncurrent labels or most of those 350 symbols, either. \u201cThey feel overwhelmed by the amount of information coming\nat them,\u201d she said, \u201cand often&nbsp; make very\nsubjective, emotional decisions around food, many of which are moment-to-moment\nand mercurial and not connected to online guides, apps, ratings, or\ntechnology.\u201d </p><p>This leaves would-be raters in a tough spot. A kind of old-fashioned\nspot, in fact. HowGood earns revenue not on its app\u2014it doesn\u2019t even try\u2014but\n<a href=\"http://upstart.bizjournals.com/money/loot/2014/09/17/howgood-food-ranking-app-scores-2m-from-vcs.html?page=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">on fees from supermarkets</a> that place its rating symbols right on the shelves,\nto help guide shoppers making those mercurial, moment-to-moment decisions. A\nquick answer about the way the company treats animals and the people who raise\nthem and the land they\u2019re raised on. Sounds simple, no? </p><p>Of course it isn\u2019t. When I first visited the two brothers who founded\nHowGood, Alexander and Arthur Gillett, nearly three years ago, they brought me\nto the one store in New York City that used their labels, a then brand-new\nsupermarket in Long Island City called <a href=\"http://foodcellarandco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foodcellar &amp; Co</a>. I liked the idea of\nseals of approval below products, especially when I could compare like with\nlike. But the system has serious limits: The three round seals, featuring drawn\nbouquets of flowers and grains, say \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cgreat,\u201d and \u201cbest.\u201d No \u201cbad,\u201d\n\u201ceven worse,\u201d or \u201cdownright lousy.\u201d The absence of a seal below a product could\nmean that it simply wasn\u2019t rated\u2014or that it was, and it was found wanting.</p><p>Why the good cheer and speechlessness? Supermarkets don\u2019t want to\ndiscourage sales of anything they put on shelves. This is what stops any\nratings with teeth from getting on labels: After the British government succeeded\nin placing a <a href=\"http://www.foodnavigator.com/Policy/Commission-opens-proceedings-against-UK-s-traffic-light-label\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">front-of-pack stoplight system</a>, with red, yellow, and green for\ncalories, sugar, saturated fat, and salt, the European Commission tried to end\nit. Manufacturers are glad to call out certain nutritional criteria in\nthumbnail symbols on the front of packages\u2014but <a href=\"http://sustainability.tufts.edu/decoding-food-labels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">only if the news is good</a>, and\nnever when it is bad. Even <a href=\"http://www.hannaford.com/content.jsp?pageName=GuidingStars&amp;leftNavArea=HealthLeftNav\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guiding Stars</a>, the best supermarket-product-rating\nsystem I\u2019ve seen, at the New England stores of <a href=\"http://www.hannaford.com/content.jsp?pageName=GuidingStars&amp;leftNavArea=HealthLeftNav\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Hannaford chain</a>, only has\nrankings of \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cbetter,\u201d and \u201cbest\u201d for \u201cnutritional value.\u201d The\nsupermarket business may be vast\u2014even a relatively modest 150-store chain,\nAlexander Gillett recently told me, has a turnover of $3 billion a year\u2014but it\n<a href=\"http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/profit-margin-supermarket-17711.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">operates on a 1 percent margin</a>. So the many, many certifiers trying to get toeholds\nin chains face a steep uphill climb. Only gutsy health departments, like those\nin<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/nyregion/28inspect.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> New York City</a> and Los Angeles, dare require bad grades to be posted in\nrestaurant windows, and that\u2019s by law.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Thus when I recently visited HowGood\u2019s sunny, fourth-floor walk-up\noffices in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn the labels still weren\u2019t in any\nmore New York City stores. Progress had been tenfold in the years since my\nvisit\u2014almost 200 stores, compared to the 20 when I first visited. But the\noverall number is small, and the stores aren\u2019t in the places you\u2019d expect them\u2014Boston,\nsay, or San Francisco. A big blue map of the U.S. showed pinned triangular\nflags where HowGood had landed a store, with Alaska cutely painted high above\nthe map and Hawaii alone on a side wall. It was very, very spotty\u2014huge swaths\nof the Northeast and middle of the country unpinned, and little flags in Texas,\nfor instance, where HowGood is in trial periods with two 150-store chains. Why\ndid they never get into, say, Whole Foods, the most obvious place for their\nsystem? HowGood did have a meeting at the chain\u2019s Austin headquarters,\nAlexander told me. But Whole Foods decided to implement its own evaluation\ncriteria\u2014logical for a company with its own purchasing avenues, but leaving\ncustomers at the mercy of the criteria the store picks, much like the investors\nwho try to find corporate social responsibility ratings in a sea of entirely\nself-reported results.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\"><p>Why distract consumers\nwith yet one more&nbsp;piece of complicated information on a label?&nbsp;</p></aside><p>Still, the brothers are persevering. They have raised over $2 million in\nseven fundraising rounds, plus initial seed money and their own investment, and\nthe staff now totals 21. Sales lures include the first three months free, a\npromised increase in sales of 4 percent per purchase\u2014a big claim, and as much\nas a 36 percent increase for \u201cbest\u201d rated products. Those are sales\ncannibalized from other products in the store, Alexander Gillett admits; but\nthe average \u201cbest\u201d comes at a premium, which helps explain the claimed overall\n4 percent sales boost. HowGood rankings, its sales team says, will help stores\nsee the 72 percent buy-in of consumers who said in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i>\nsurvey that they would spend more for \u201cbetter for the world products.\u201d These\nare increased sales that stores won\u2019t see, the pitch continues, unless\nconsumers have the tools to figure out which products really are better for the\nworld.</p><p>Like Starkman\u2019s millennials, I have no plans to whip out my cell phone in\na store to see whether I can feel virtuous about buying one thing over another.\nSo I\u2019m taken with the idea of HowGood, as partial as its labels will be at any\nparticipating market, and like the idea of objective criteria, or at least\nevaluations from a third party. But until the brothers make more headway, the\nlikeliest solution will be to find community markets whose owners you trust to\nstock products they believe in\u2014stores like the cult Bi-Rite, in San Francisco,\nor the godfather of them all, Zingerman\u2019s, in Ann Arbor. And these are in fact\nmembers of a group of markets assembled by Sarah Weiner, originator of the <a href=\"http://www.goodfoodawards.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Good\nFood Awards</a>, which promote products that meet a list of criteria that\u2019s smaller\nthan yet similar to HowGood\u2019s\u2014but with a clear emphasis on flavor, which\nHowGood sidesteps. So far, the group of stores numbers just 17, Weiner told me,\nand stores must be 51 percent owned by families, individuals, or workers. She\nplans to limit the number to 30. It\u2019s stores like these that will be easiest\u2014if\nnot cheapest\u2014for the food-conscious millennials Starkman and others are\nscrutinizing, where the roof constitutes an umbrella of virtue. I\u2019ll most enjoy\nfeeling virtuous by supporting the people who run and work in the store, and\nknowing they\u2019re treated well\u2014the invisible label that matters most to me.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133024/flaws-do-gooder-food-ratings</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133024</guid><category><![CDATA[Magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[June 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[food]]></category><category><![CDATA[Columns]]></category><category><![CDATA[Edible Life]]></category><category><![CDATA[-homepage-top]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Corby  Kummer]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/cf720a64c9d455928e6b35bb4c099ba0b88c932f.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Primary Concerns Episode 12: Andrew Sullivan Says Trump Will Ruin Us.

That law, British economist Aaron Reeves and his colleagues <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hec.3336/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> in <i>Health Economics</i>, substantially improved the mental health of low-wage earners \u201cby reducing financial strain in low-wage workers.\u201d</p><p>There is a frequent policy debate about whether it is better to improve the health of the poor by <a href=\"http://economics.mit.edu/files/10580\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">providing them with better access to treatment or by giving them more money</a>. Everyone deserves access to a decent minimum of care, of course.<b> </b>But being at the bottom of the economic ladder is a <a href=\"https://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2010/v71n09/v71n0909.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">big mental health risk factor</a>, a finding that has been <a href=\"http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/157/2/98.full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">replicated in many studies</a>. Getting a wage increase helps workers cope with <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.143938\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">life stresses that promote the risk of depression</a> and other mental health disorders.<span> </span></p><p>The British study used data from the <a href=\"https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/bhps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">British Household Panel Survey</a>, a sample of U.K. families who are interviewed annually about their well-being and livelihoods\u2014including a <a href=\"http://www.gl-assessment.co.uk/products/general-health-questionnaire-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mental health questionnaire</a> that measured whether they experienced levels of symptoms consistent with having a psychiatric disorder. The researchers compared workers who received higher wages because of the minimum-wage law to two comparison groups. One group included low-wage workers who should have gotten an increase but did not because their employers didn\u2019t comply with the law. The other group included workers who did not get a wage increase because they were paid just above the minimum wage threshold. For each group, the researchers estimated the difference between their mental health before the law came into effect in 1999 and their mental health after.<span> </span></p><p>If getting higher wages is good for you, then the change in the mental health of workers who received higher wages ought to be greater than the change in the two groups of comparison workers who did not. The researchers found that workers who got higher wages because of the minimum wage law also experienced an improvement in their mental health, both in absolute terms and relative to the comparison groups. Importantly, the effect of the wage increase was about as large as taking <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14974002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">an anti-depressant medication</a>.</p><p>There are reasons to worry about Reeves\u2019s data. The most important concern is that it was not a true experiment, because workers could not be randomly selected to either get a wage increase or not. So it\u2019s possible that the improvement in the mental health of workers who got a raise had some other cause. However, a recent randomized experiment produced similar results. In the <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1212321\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oregon Health Insurance Experiment</a>, uninsured Portland residents were able to enter a lottery, and the winners could apply for insurance through Medicaid. The primary benefits of insurance are financial: Getting Medicaid reduces both the out of pocket cost of health care and the risk of incurring unpayable medical bills. Not surprisingly, recipients who got Medicaid reported reduced financial strain. They also reported improved self-reported mental health and were less likely to be identified as depressed.</p><p>It\u2019s always been harder for Americans to get mental health care than physical health care. In most communities there are not enough mental health care providers to meet the demands for services. Many psychiatric medications are expensive. Health insurance often provides inadequate coverage for mental health care. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3359059/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Some of these problems</a> were addressed in the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 and the Affordable Care Act, <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/About-NAMI/Publications-Reports/Public-Policy-Reports/A-Long-Road-Ahead/2015-ALongRoadAhead.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">but significant problems remain</a>.</p><p>We need to be realistic about the limits of what we can achieve if we only work on the mental health treatment system. Delivering anti-depressants and psychotherapy to the many people who need them is much harder than it looks. Training and hiring more mental health specialists won\u2019t mean that all the people who need care will get it. Like every other specialized clinician, most mental health providers do not serve the urban or rural poor. Newly minted psychiatrists are far more likely to open practices in Manhattan than in East Baltimore, or <a href=\"http://www.openmedicine.ca/article/view/624.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">in Toronto than in Thunder Bay</a>. Moreover, low-income patients find it difficult to make therapy appointments, fill prescriptions, or consistently take medications. Increasing the resources for mental health care is essential, but it will only dent the problem.<span> </span></p><p>Therefore, we need not just better treatment but also preventive mental health care: public policies that reduce the number of people who become mentally ill. Cholera was defeated in the industrialized world by clean drinking water, not antibiotics. Similarly, we need to develop strategies for attacking the social determinants of mental health problems.</p><p>The finding that you can reduce mental health problems by increasing the minimum wage is important because raising the wage is easier than redesigning the mental health treatment system. Getting mental health services into poor communities and getting poor people to access them are largely unsolved problems. How to pass and enforce a minimum wage law is well-understood.</p><p>Moreover, increasing the minimum wage provides an immediate preventive benefit to a large number of highly stressed people. See again the British example. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/01/number-of-uk-workers-on-minimum-wage-expected-to-double-by-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">minimum wage applied to only 2 percent of British workers in 1999</a>, but since then the wage has been increased so that it now benefits 5 percent, and under the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2ae61f24-f2a9-11e5-aff5-19b4e253664a.html#axzz46CnyF8HH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Living Wage</a> policy it will benefit more than 10 percent (3.2 million workers) in 2020. In effect, raising the minimum wage may be like putting antidepressants in the water pipes serving millions of low-wage workers.</p><p>The debate about increasing the minimum wage usually focuses on <a href=\"http://www.nelp.org/content/uploads/Minimum-Wage-Basics-Business-Effects.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the clear economic gains</a> for low-wage workers and the potential costs to business owners. Some policy analysts <a href=\"http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2015/december/effects-of-minimum-wage-on-employment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">worry</a>, for example, that it may cause businesses to close or make it harder for the unemployed to find jobs. But if the findings of the British minimum wage study are accurate, and can be applied to the American system, then it provides yet another compelling moral argument for ensuring that everyone earns a living wage.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133302/improve-mental-health-america-raise-minimum-wage</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133302</guid><category><![CDATA[Minimum Wage]]></category><category><![CDATA[Economics]]></category><category><![CDATA[mental health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health Care]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bill Gardner]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 15:09:09 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/782663f4f3d9952d74f698911ba0a4f342734cc8.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[You Must\nRemember This]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class=\"article-embed image-embed pull-right\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/5890f2c1fba8f52800e0553de5aceffe323b9c2c.jpeg?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;79180a0a-24f1-4d25-a04e-bfa76ae7de3a&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;5890f2c1fba8f52800e0553de5aceffe323b9c2c&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1800,&quot;height&quot;:2100,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/5890f2c1fba8f52800e0553de5aceffe323b9c2c.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"><figcaption><span class=\"caption-text\">Photograph by Adrian Skenderovic from the series \u201cMummies\u201d.</span></figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"\">The duty to remember\u2014especially to remember victims lost to political evil\u2014has become one of the most commanding mantras of our culture. Yet it is astonishing how recently this imperative became so authoritative. Kings have raised monuments to their own alleged greatness for millennia, but commemoration of the dead of the wars of nations reached its apogee only in the early twentieth century with the end of World War I and now-familiar invocations of the heroism and self-sacrifice of soldiers for the sake of the nation\u2019s political fortunes.</span><span><br></span></p><aside id=\"signal-133017\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>In a more recent shift, only some decades after World War II did people conclude that if nations keep causing wars, it is better to identify with the innocent victims of the political contention, or with their mangled bodies and ruined psyches, than with the combatants. World War II was initially memorialized the way modern people had memorialized wars before: by consecrating a cult of heroes. Until the 1980s very few memorials to the events, and indeed no histories of them, alluded to the innocents who had found themselves in the way of the clash of nations, or to the Jews who were the obsessive quarry of one of them. Now it would be obtuse to think about World War II without placing the persecution and victimhood of the Holocaust at its moral center.</p><p>This new age of honoring the innocent goes along with another shift toward dwelling on physical and psychic injury. In an illuminating <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/11/08/getting-over-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">article in <i>The</i> <i>New Yorker</i></a> in 2004, Malcolm Gladwell recalled that in the 1950s, Sloan Wilson\u2019s novel <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Man-Gray-Flannel-Suit/dp/1568582463\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a></i> dramatized the story of a man who witnesses horrific events as an American soldier in World War II but comes home as if nothing had happened. Even though the protagonist of the novel had himself engaged in horrendous brutality, Gladwell observed, for him \u201cthe final truth of the war, and he had greeted it with relief, greeted it eagerly, [was] the simple fact that it was incomprehensible and had to be forgotten. Things just happen.\u201d Indeed, Gladwell concluded from this one survivor\u2019s response: \u201cThey happen and they happen again, and anybody who tries to make sense out of it goes out of his mind.\u201d</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-left\">Something drastic had happened: It became publicly meaningful to dwell on wounds and \u201ctrauma.\u201d </aside><p>This nonchalant response to violence now seems almost unintelligible\u2014a fact Gladwell illustrated by comparing Wilson\u2019s book to Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lake-Woods-Tim-OBrien/dp/061870986X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">In the Lake of the Woods</a></i>, a novel from 40 years later, in which a Vietnam war veteran is haunted by memories and disabled by regrets. Something drastic had happened: At some point a few decades ago, it became publicly meaningful to dwell on wounds and \u201ctrauma.\u201d A new type of memory had taken hold. Testimonies were recorded, monuments erected, museums built, and curricula updated.</p><p>In his new book <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Praise-Forgetting-Historical-Memory-Ironies/dp/0300182791\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">In Praise of Forgetting: Historical Memory and Its Ironies</a></i>, David Rieff doesn\u2019t explain why this happened, but he doubts that it is entirely a good thing. As his title implies, he wants to undercut the imperative of remembering and to counsel the uses of forgetting. Some of his arguments reflect a pessimism in the technical sense\u2014if nothing matters it is hardly worth remembering it\u2014but most turn on the point that memorializing evil may compound it, for it is those who cherish their own wounds who are likeliest to inflict new ones on others. A journalist who has frequented global hotspots and an analyst of humanitarian policy (as well as curator of the collected and posthumous writings of his mother, Susan Sontag), Rieff advances his argument in spare prose, with implacable tenacity, and vast knowledge. Yet to reckon with whether to forget or to remember, it may be necessary to figure out why we began to place so much emphasis on victims and injuries.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Rieff begins with a cynical wisdom that may prove too much, and he constantly returns to it, showing how deep a streak of pessimism runs in his thinking. Like all individuals, Rieff says, all states and civilizations will die sooner or later, and preserving memory is hardly desirable right now if it is not possible in the long run. From the affirmation in Ecclesiastes that memory provides no immunity from the shipwreck of time to Percy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s portrait in \u201c<a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/resources/learning/core-poems/detail/46565\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ozymandias</a>\u201d of a sneering king\u2019s ambition to eternal dominion reduced to broken statuary, oblivion wins over preservation in the end. In Rieff\u2019s words: \u201cSooner or later every human accomplishment, like every human being, will be forgotten.\u201d And if so, why not speed up the process?</p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed pull-small pull-right\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/d5b8b222d5a3b6739cf321359e79887e8db3317c.tiff?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;a5dccce7-e823-433f-bbf3-165a1e2ce796&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;d5b8b222d5a3b6739cf321359e79887e8db3317c&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1687,&quot;height&quot;:2545,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;TIFF&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/d5b8b222d5a3b6739cf321359e79887e8db3317c.tiff&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"><figcaption><span class=\"caption-text\">IN PRAISE OF FORGETTING: HISTORICAL MEMORY AND ITS IRONIES by David Rieff </span><span class=\"credit\">Yale University Press, 160 pp., $25</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rieff\u2019s first argument for forgetting, therefore, is that the most successful memorialization merely postpones its own failure by a bit. \u201cGame, set, and match to Shelley,\u201d Rieff remarks\u2014and he could have added that Shelley was playing small ball. After all, our sun will go out in five billion years, and\u2014since perhaps the heroes of a latter-day <i>Interstellar</i> will successfully transplant the species\u2014one day the universe might contract back in a big crunch and cancel itself out. What of all our grand plans then? As philosopher Samuel Scheffler has shown in his wonderful <i><a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/death-and-the-afterlife-9780199982509?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Death and the Afterlife</a></i>, the prospect of our personal demise does not reduce existence to insignificance, but the extinction of the species\u2014and by extension, of the universe\u2014certainly might.</p><p>The relevance of these morbid thoughts to the question of whether to cherish the memory of humanity\u2019s fallen heroes or murdered victims, however, is dubious for the reasons Rieff himself acknowledges: \u201cWe have no other practical choice than to try to live our lives and contribute to our societies as if Ecclesiastes were wrong. \u2026 Remembrance is emphatically not meaningless except in the cognitively and probably ethically useless framework of eternity.\u201d As philosophers since the ancients have known, it is helpful to put our exaggerated self-regard and our passionate overinvestments in trivialities in their place by minimizing their significance. But there is no way to live a personal or collective life from the perspective of the eventual oblivion of everything. In his enormous act of self-memorialization in the pages of <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>, Marcel Proust\u2019s narrator is certainly not above Rieff\u2019s insight into inevitable obsolescence. \u201cNo doubt my books too, like my fleshly being, would in the end one day die,\u201d he reflects. \u201cWe accept the thought that in ten years we ourselves, in a hundred years our books, will have ceased to exist. Eternal duration is promised no more to men\u2019s works than to men.\u201d Even so, he writes his masterpiece.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">His central argument is that memory of national honor, far from affording reconciliation, is as likely to exacerbate historical violence.</aside><p>Rieff extends his indictment by dwelling repeatedly on the distortions\u2014if not outright falsehoods\u2014of memory, contrasting it with history. As a great sage once noted, memories may be beautiful, and yet the likelihood is that time has rewritten every line. After excursions into contemporary Australian and Irish commemoration of a lost past that never was, Rieff cites the example of the Scottish kilt, which supposedly preserves immemorial tradition but actually dates from the modern age. But his central and most convincing argument is that memory either of national honor or innocent death, far from affording reconciliation, is as likely\u2014if not more likely\u2014to exacerbate historical violence in the very act of canonizing it. If that were true, it would indeed wreak havoc with our default assumption that the dead and suffering demand our persistent cognizance.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Rieff\u2019s penchant for morbidity is his most fascinating moral stance, but it is when he puts it on hold and consents to argue with the rest of us about shorter-term outcomes that he is even more compelling. And he is self-evidently right that remembering one\u2019s nation\u2019s heroes or innocent victims often amounts to \u201cpalliating the culture of grievance\u201d and thus gathering kindling for new historical fires. \u201cFar too often collective historical memory ... has led to war rather than peace, to rancor and ressentiment (which increasingly appears to be the defining emotion of our age) rather than reconciliation, and to the determination to exact revenge rather than commit to the hard work of forgiveness,\u201d Rieff wisely observes. Yet at most this proves the need for a politics that isolates cases when memory promotes peace and prompts understanding rather than stokes war and irritates relationships.</p><p>Rieff powerfully cites his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Bosnia-Failure-David-Rieff/dp/0684819031\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">experience as a reporter in the Bosnian wars of the 1990s</a> as evidence that memory mostly functions to awaken slumbering enmity and boost its intensity. After the universalist ideology of the Cold War era departed, Yugoslavs remembered their long-ago particularity in epic, folktale, and song, and suddenly \u201cancient ethnic hatreds\u201d became the watchword of the region\u2014though their basis in real history was flimsy. Even today, for all the counterprogramming (including international criminal courts throwing the book at genocidal killers), the region remains marked by the effects of ethnic autonomy and cleansing driven by \u201cmemory.\u201d</p><p>It is also true that we have learned since the 1990s that the intervention of self-appointed humanists, driven by memories of just how grim the clash of peoples can become, often makes things worse rather than better. After the ur-experience of the Holocaust, the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda taught the calamity of \u201cstanding idly by.\u201d But intervention, most recently in Libya in defense of the civilians of Benghazi, has proved almost as calamitous. Responding to the memory of the Holocaust by saving strangers from slaughter, however honorable in itself, has given the phrase \u201cnever again\u201d a new meaning. \u201cEnough,\u201d President Obama reportedly told his U.N. ambassador, Samantha Power, recently in the face of her entreaties to help Syrians facing expulsion and extinction. Power\u2019s celebrated book <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Problem-Hell-America-Age-Genocide/dp/0465061516\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cA Problem from Hell\u201d: America and the Age of Genocide</a> </i>had criticized America\u2019s historical failure to stop genocide around the world, as if intervention would come from heaven. In an immortal comment, Obama registered the limits of the memorialization of horror in the face of our proven capacity to do little more than worsen it: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">I\u2019ve already read your book.</a>\u201d</p><aside class=\"pullquote figure-active pull-left\">We have learned since the 1990s that the intervention of self-appointed humanists often makes things worse rather than better.</aside><p>Yet to say that memory is inevitably counterproductive is obviously to go too far. For this very reason, Rieff understands that most of his own short book has to be directed against optimists. They not only claim that life itself matters in spite of its inevitable individual and collective end, but also that there is an \u201cethics\u201d that explains how to save the beneficent uses of memory from its baleful abuses. In particular, Rieff grapples with Israeli philosopher Avishai Margalit and Bulgarian-French moralist Tzvetan Todorov, both of whom have outlined this seemingly reasonable program. </p><p>Their visions are utopian, Rieff responds; they understate the risk of the pain that memory causes, while overstating the likelihood that memory will promote good ends. Margalit, for example, <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674013780\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">has counseled the collective preservation</a> of the memory of great crimes like the Holocaust on the cosmopolitan grounds that they also remind a global audience what kind of world to build to prevent their repetition. For Rieff, Margalit is engaged in a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d Contemporary beliefs in the powers of memory to abet reconciliation of onetime enemies and prevent future massacres, Rieff judges, make \u201cthe Renaissance alchemists who believed they could turn base metals into gold seem almost modest by comparison.\u201d Probably so, but surely the consequence is not blanket forgetting either. That memory is not a miracle cure does not mean that the waters of blessed Lethe, the river in Hades that cleansed worthy people of their troubling pasts, should be bottled for the living. </p><p>At times, Rieff flirts with Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s radical position that memory\u2014especially memory driven by resentment\u2014is harmful to our vitality, and that it is more manful not simply to enjoy the inevitable violence of human life but also to forget any troublesome memories that might impede the next round. (For Nietzsche, it is the \u201cmark of strong, complete natures\u201d to embrace \u201cthe power to forget.\u201d) It is not clear how Rieff, who witnessed the Bosnian slaughterhouse, and who has spent his career reflecting on that very un-Nietzschean project of contemporary humanitarian aid, can in the end do more than warn that memory does not unfailingly help, and sometimes hurts. But it all depends on the circumstances. </p><p>Rieff\u2019s contrarian assault on memory turns out, then, to be distinctly moderate and to deal with likely results rather than hard and fast rules. For example, Rieff is very clear that he wants wrongdoers of historical crimes to be brought to justice where possible\u2014\u201cI am not prescribing moral Alzheimer\u2019s here,\u201d he acknowledges\u2014only he wants to show how ludicrous it is to insist on premising peace on such accountability and demanding expiation and reconciliation every time. He therefore wonders whether \u201cforgetting without the preamble of forgiveness or the promise of justice has a value,\u201d and whether \u201ca decent measure of communal forgetting is actually the sine qua non of a peaceful and decent society.\u201d Sometimes, sometimes not. At best, however, he raises a possibility that shifts the burden onto those who demand remembrance to take care to promote better rather than worse outcomes.</p><p>I recently served on a committee that resolved to remove the seal of Harvard Law School, which honored a slaveholder, a fact that only became widely known recently when it was publicized by student activists. A colleague on the committee dissented and argued for keeping the seal in order to make an uncomfortable reminder of slavery omnipresent. No one in the majority had the temerity to recommend forgetting that crime; rather, the committee concluded that there is not one proper way\u2014let alone one guaranteed method\u2014to provoke people to confront the tainted origins of so many of our institutions. Rieff includes a sobering reminder that for a long time American memory cherished the Confederate South\u2019s \u201clost cause\u201d and incited new violence, but it would be remarkable to conclude from this example that people should strive to forget the whole sordid episode rather than to debate with one another about how to remember it most justifiably.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Where Rieff is most thought-provoking in the end is in intuiting a monumental change in our culture, and sounding the alarm about where this change has been leading. Rieff has not worked out how an inspiring politics would make use of the past and keep faith with its victims. Yet <i>In Praise of Forgetting </i>matters because it demands more clarity about why after World War II the memory of national victory gave way to the memory of humanity\u2019s wounds, and why this form of dwelling on the past somehow became so peremptory\u2014in many quarters, a kind of implacable orthodoxy. For, quite apart from the sins of escapist nostalgia and self-involved narcissism it has often wrought, the deep worry is that what Rieff calls \u201cthe memory industry\u201d has also taken up the cultural space our more willingly forgetful ancestors made for forging a common future.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">The deep worry is that \u201cthe memory industry\u201d has taken up the cultural space our ancestors made for forging a common future.</aside><p>One of Rieff\u2019s regrets about memory is that it is too political, serving narrow agendas: \u201cThe takeover of history by memory,\u201d he intones, \u201cis also the takeover of history by politics.\u201d Memories of the past, neutral though they may seem, \u201clegitimiz[e] a particular worldview and political and social agenda.\u201d But he also voices the worry that the universalist arguments for collective memory have been \u201cin their essence profoundly anti- or at least post-political in orientation.\u201d While parochial groups appeal to the past to lend credence to their case for present advantage, cosmopolitan memories of great crimes like the Holocaust have been mobilized precisely to transcend the endless conflicts of states, nations, and peoples. As inspiring as this dream has been, Rieff rightly concludes it is not politically contentious and realistic enough to get much done.</p><p>Arguably the best response to this situation is to recommend not more sweet forgetting, but more politically effective memory than our age of victimhood has known. After the dead are dead, their memory matters for the sake of our campaigns for justice: to inspire them in the first place or to give them strength. That memory serves conservatives and nationalists does not mean their progressive and cosmopolitan opponents should relinquish the field of struggle. But perhaps they will need to learn to focus less on the crimes of the past and more on the unfulfilled hopes of our ancestors for a just world\u2014hopes of which our age of memory all too frequently loses track in its very effort to honor their deaths. </p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133017/must-remember-war-memorials-david-rieff</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133017</guid><category><![CDATA[Books]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[June 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Review]]></category><category><![CDATA[History]]></category><category><![CDATA[Memory]]></category><category><![CDATA[memorial]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><category><![CDATA[-homepage-lower]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Samuel Moyn]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/8fc140ed3fd7d24aa5819efe895032507b131c51.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[When All Men Were Created Separate, But Equal]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><span>Racial\nsegregation, we are often told, has its roots in the Jim Crow South.

The 1896 </span><i>Plessy\n</i>v.<i> Ferguson </i><span>decision sanctioned these \u201cseparate but equal\u201d laws, and if\nnorthern liberals bore any responsibility, it was in so easily accepting them.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><aside id=\"signal-133243\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>If\nonly history were so simple. In his brilliant and provocative new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bind-Apart-Enlightened-Americans-Segregation/dp/0465018416/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461877010&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Bind+Us+Apart%3A+How+Enlightened+Americans+Invented+Racial+Segregation%2C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Bind\nUs Apart: How Enlightened Americans Invented Racial Segregation</i></a>, Cambridge historian Nicholas Guyatt demonstrates\nthat the roots of \u201cseparate but equal\u201d reach much further back than\nReconstruction America\u2014they were present at the nation\u2019s founding. The logic of\nsegregation, he argues, was in large part created by antislavery, enlightenment-era\nwhite liberals in the north and the south during the first decades of the\nRepublic. During this period, the nation\u2019s most learned, liberal minds\u2014including\nJohn Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson, as well as equally\nprogressive next generation figures such as John Quincy Adams\u2014embraced segregationist\npolicies based on Enlightenment ideals.<span>&nbsp;<br></span></p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed pull-small pull-right\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/7364b2368b77ea621fb6b16647dbda781d0eeb1b.jpeg?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;e9db81e9-70bf-41c4-a99a-91c98bb8f30b&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;7364b2368b77ea621fb6b16647dbda781d0eeb1b&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1875,&quot;height&quot;:2850,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/7364b2368b77ea621fb6b16647dbda781d0eeb1b.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"><figcaption><span class=\"caption-text\">BIND US APART: HOW ENLIGHTENED AMERICANS INVENTED RACIAL SEGREGATION, by Nicholas Guyatt</span><span class=\"credit\">Basic Books, 419 pp., $29</span></figcaption></figure><p>Central\nto these policies was the notion that all human races shared a common origin.\nThe Enlightenment\u2019s leading scientific thinkers had, during the latter\neighteenth century, begun to lay they foundations for modern notions of race.\nFew had a larger influence than the French natural philosopher the <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Georges-Louis-Leclerc-comte-de-Buffon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comte de\nBuffon</a>, perhaps the most revered naturalist before Charles Darwin. Beginning in\nthe mid-eighteenth century, Buffon argued that all human beings were part of\nthe same species and that any physical differences that emerged were the result\nof the natural environment and social circumstances. Hot climates could explain\ndarker skin colors, for instance, and social structures\u2014like forms of\ngovernment and systems of labor, including slavery\u2014might lead certain groups to\nbecome \u201cdegraded.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Even\nwhen other Enlightenment naturalists, like the creator of the modern taxonomic\nsystem, Carl Linneaus, began to place these groups into different racial categories,\nalmost no serious thinker questioned whether all groups were part of the same species. In true Enlightenment fashion, they insisted\nthat any perceived racial deficiencies could be overcome, mainly through a\nchange in the natural environment and an improvement in social conditions. Drawing upon these principles, enlightened white\nAmericans could argue that if blacks appeared less intelligent or more morally\ndepraved than whites\u2014a point nearly all of them conceded\u2014it was largely the\nresult of slavery. Deprived of the rudiments of civilization\u2014education,\nChristianity, freedom\u2014blacks became \u201cdegraded into a perpetual bondage,\u201d as\nFranklin wrote in 1790. Give blacks freedom, educate and convert them, the\nthinking went, and all their alleged deficiencies would disappear.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Slaveholders\nand settlers who suggested otherwise, that African and Native Americans were\ninnately inferior or irreversibly degraded, risked the opprobrium of the leading\nliberal minds. And yet, Guyatt argues,\nit was the liberal-minded founders, not their less enlightened adversaries, who\nlaid the foundation for the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d mindset. He sees the\nideology\u2019s origins not in the late-nineteenth century\u2019s Jim Crow laws, but in\ntheir largely forgotten early-nineteenth century equivalents: the attempts to\n<a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Colonization-Society\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">recolonize freed slaves</a> back to Africa and to resettle Native Americans along\nthe western frontier.&nbsp;</p><p>Liberal\nleaders hatched both ideas in the 1780s, and the following generation of\nprogressive minds began putting them into action in the 1820s. Guyatt stresses\nthat black colonization and native resettlement were resolutely <i>not </i>based on the presumption of African\nand Native Americans\u2019 innate inferiority, but on the idea that if both groups\nwere removed from the \u201cdegrading\u201d effects of white society, they could realize\ntheir full potential. In the end, he writes, colonization and resettlement provided\na \u201clife raft for liberal whites, who were caught between the unambiguous promises\nof 1776\u201d\u2014that is, the Declaration of Independence\u2019s assertion that \u201call men\nwere created equal\u201d\u2014\u201cand the practical difficulties of creating a mixed-race\nrepublic.\u201d&nbsp;</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p><span>The\nhistories of African American colonization and native resettlement tend to be\ntreated as footnotes to early American history. But Guyatt uncovers their\nsurprising purchase among America\u2019s most prominent leaders, all the way up to\nAbraham Lincoln, despite the policies themselves being practical failures. Rarely\nare colonization and resettlement studied together, however, and rarely are\nthey cast as anything but duplicitous ploys concocted by racist whites utterly\nopposed to either group\u2019s equality. But at the turn of the nineteenth century,\nit was enlightened white liberals who largely pushed the idea of black\ncolonization and native resettlement, and that they did so out of a genuine\nbelief that African and Native Americans could become the equal of whites.</span></p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">It was enlightened white liberals who largely pushed the idea of black colonization and native resettlement.</aside><p>The\nidea of colonizing freed slaves voluntarily, either by returning them to Africa\nor resettling them on the western frontier, emerged simultaneously with the\nantislavery movement in the 1780s. Thomas Jefferson understood the conundrum\nfaced by reform-minded slaveholders, as he was himself at once intellectually\nopposed to slavery yet fearful of emancipation\u2019s consequences: \u201cWe have the\nwolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go.\u201d<b> </b>In subsequent decades he was joined by\na raft of less contentious leaders who history has tended to treat as\nbenighted, benevolent souls. <a href=\"https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/edward-coles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edward Coles</a>, a young, idealistic Virginian who had\nserved as secretary to President James Madison, moved to the Illinois Territory\nin 1819, freeing his 18 slaves when he arrived, but when white residents filed\na lawsuit against him for doing so, he quickly became a champion of\ncolonization. Coles told his former slaves, who refused to emigrate, that their\nhard work \u201cconfirm[ed] my opinions of the unity and equality of man.\u201d Yet he\ncontinued, until his death in 1868, to be an outspoken leader of the\ncolonization movement, which had established Liberia as a colony for freed\nslaves in 1821. Abraham Lincoln greatly admired Coles, meeting with him in\n1861, and, in his famous debates against Stephen Douglas three years earlier, had\nsaid that he preferred to \u201cfree all the slaves, and send them to Liberia.\u201d Free\nblack leaders themselves entertained the idea until the mid-1810s, when they\nrealized that few blacks were interested. But white antislavery leaders continued\nto push voluntary colonization as a way to appease slaveholders, who insisted\nthat freeing their slaves without resettling them would invite a race war.</p><p>Meanwhile,\nnorthern states struggled to integrate their small free black populations freed\nduring the revolution\u2014by 1804 all of them had emancipation laws on the books. Yet\nwhile they congratulated themselves on their benevolence, the northern states were\nalso among the first to segregate whites from blacks. Massachusetts made interracial\nmarriage illegal in 1786; Pennsylvania, home to the early republic\u2019s largest\nfree black community, <a href=\"http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/pa-heritage/african-americans-civil-rights-pennsylvania.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">technically allowed black citizenship</a>, but de facto\ndiscrimination effectively barred them from participating in its central rights:\nowning property, serving on juries, and voting. Nationally, Guyatt explains, the\nfederal government tended \u201cto either restrict black rights or to fudge the\nquestion of citizenship.\u201d</p><p>In\nthis context, colonization went from being a marginal idea in the 1780s to a\ncentral plank of the white antislavery platform in the 1820s. In 1816, national\nantislavery leaders formed the exclusively white <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Colonization-Society\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Colonization Society</a>\nin an effort to answer the question that befuddled northerners as much southerners:\nWhat to do with blacks <i>after</i> slavery?\nPerhaps most provocatively, Guyatt argues that even the more radical white\nantislavery leaders that emerged in the 1830s provided fodder for colonization by\nexpressing their revulsion at intermarriage, then called amalgamation. Though radical\nantislavery leaders largely rejected colonization, in publicly voicing their\ndisdain for intermarriage, they proved that even they were unwilling to accept\none possible consequence of emancipation. In 1833, <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Lydia-Maria-Child\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lydia Maria Child</a>, an early\nmember of William Lloyd Garrison\u2019s new <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p1561.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">radical movement</a>, denounced slaveholders\u2019\nargument that they were in effect endorsing intermarriage: Such a claim was\n\u201cperfectly ridiculous and unfounded,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNo abolitionist considers\nsuch a thing desirable.\u201d</p><p>Guyatt\ncan at times overstate his case. He shows, after all, that Garrison and his\nallies worked hard, and successfully, to overturn Massachusetts\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/anti-amalgamation-law-passed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">anti-amalgamation\nlaw</a> in 1843. Guyatt dismisses this effort as \u201csymbolic,\u201d arguing that radical\nantislavery leaders saw the law as a \u201clegal embarrassment\u201d rather than an\nindication of their approval of interracial marriage. Perhaps, but he tends to equate\ndisapproval of intermarriage with disapproval of an interracial society, which\nis a questionable assumption. Moreover, Guyatt underplays the extent to which\nracial prejudice guided British antislavery opinion, suggesting that the\n\u201cseparate but equal\u201d mindset had uniquely American origins. Yet, as Guyatt notes,\n<a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/place/Sierra-Leone/Sports-and-recreation#toc55344\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sierra Leone</a>, the British antislavery colony established in 1787, provided the\ntemplate for Liberia. He argues that\nBritish abolitionists justified Sierra Leone\u2019s creation mainly in economic\nterms, to prove that a free labor African colony could be as profitable as\nslave-based Caribbean ones. While technically true, this overshadows the way\nSierra Leone also served to mask British society\u2019s inability to integrate its\nown free black population. To argue that racial integration was as much a\nproblem for Britain as it was for the United States is not to discount the\ndepths of America\u2019s racial divide; it is to gesture toward the magnitude of the\nproblem.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Many\nof the same white liberals who backed colonization promoted Native American removal.\n<a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Jedidiah-Morse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jedidiah Morse</a>, a Connecticut missionary who recruited African Americans to\nresettle in Sierra Leone in 1815, could be found four years later lobbying Congress\nto set up a western territory for Native Americans. Like most early liberal\nadvocates of resettlement, Morse believed that providing natives with a\nseparate territory would save them from the negative influences of white\nsociety: for too long, he argued, land-hungry settlers did nothing but provoke\nviolence on the frontier, plying natives with guns and liquor rather than, as\noriginally hoped, teaching them the benefits of \u201ccivilization.\u201d &nbsp;</p><p>One\nmain difference distinguishing native resettlement from black colonization,\nGuyatt argues, was that white liberals originally embraced intermarriage between\nnatives and whites. Beginning in the 1790s, federal officials <a href=\"http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/cdewp/85-26.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">promoted\nnative-white intermarriages</a> as a means to civilize natives, ease westward\nexpansion, and ultimately absorb natives into the new nation. Again, it was Jefferson\nwho best articulated this hope: In 1808, he told a delegation of Delaware and\nMohican leaders visiting Washington: \u201cYou will mix with us by marriage, your\nblood run in our veins, and will spread with us over this great island.\u201d</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\">These liberal efforts failed in large part because they denied Native and African Americans any say in their own future.</aside><p>But\nNative Americans were no less skeptical of liberal reform efforts than African\nAmericans. As a result, earlier plans for native integration gave way to a\nfull-on push for resettlement, especially after the War of 1812. During the war, Ohio Valley nations, led by\nthe Shawnee leader <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Tecumseh-Shawnee-chief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tecumseh</a>, allied with the British in an attempt to stave off\nfurther westward expansion. When U.S. forces killed Tecumseh in 1813, the dream\nof integration died with him, and white reformers began to see resettlement as\nthe only way to prevent their further annihilation. Reformers like Morse\ngenuinely believed that voluntarily resettling eastern nations in a separate\nwestern territory would pave the way for both their survival and, as he wrote\nin an influential 1822 report, the \u201cenjoyment of the privileges of citizens.\u201d\nBut when the Cherokees, among the largest remaining nations east of the\nMississippi, refused to voluntarily resettle, less enlightened officials turned\nto force. By 1838, the Andrew Jackson\u2019s successor Martin Van Buren had ordered the military to expel 10,000 Cherokees from the southeast in what\nbecame known as the Trail of Tears.</p><p>The\ndifferences between native removal and black colonization have tended to\nobscure their deeper congruities. Guyatt poignantly captures the parallels not\nonly by showing that many liberal advocates of native resettlement also\nendorsed black colonization, but also by teasing out the subtler dynamics\nunifying both histories. Both these liberal efforts failed in large part\nbecause they denied Native and African Americans any say in their own future,\nand instead strove to appease a wary white majority. When many whites proved\nunwilling to fully accept either group, liberal reformers could blame the problem\nof integration on less enlightened whites, using a \u201cseparate but equal\u201d justification\nto obscure their own unexamined prejudices.</p><p>After\nall, Guyatt reminds us that liberal reformers accepted that African and Native\nAmericans were \u201c<i>currently </i>inferior to\nwhites.\u201d Still, they insisted that their inferiority was reversible and did so\nto counter more blatant racist ideas premised on innate inferiority and used to\njustify the enslavement of blacks and violence against natives. To ignore the\ndifferences between enlightened white racial ideas and the balder bigotries\nthey tried to defeat is to ignore the depth and breadth of our troubled racial\nhistory. Our racial divides persist today in part because we have left unchecked\na version of our history that traces the origins of our racism to either the\nbigotry of white southerners or the baser instincts of crude white settlers. By\ndemonstrating that segregationist ideas began at the founding, were sanctioned\nby well-intentioned white liberals, and had spread across the nation, Guyatt has\nwritten a remarkable history that matches the gravity of the problem.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133243/men-created-separate-equal</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133243</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Books]]></category><category><![CDATA[American Revolution]]></category><category><![CDATA[Slavery]]></category><category><![CDATA[Native Americans]]></category><category><![CDATA[segregation]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Eric Herschthal]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/aba9e83724c4efbc50673d216767f65acde2f205.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grierson &amp; Leitch Episode 15: <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, <i>Keanu</i>, and a Summer Movie Preview ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Marvel superheroes abound on this week\u2019s episode of the podcast.

The former still wouldn\u2019t give him the delegate lead, though, and current polling is hardly predictive of who is more electable in November.</span></p><p>In truth, Sanders has a better argument for the staying in the race, one that was <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-delegate-quit-222503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">made by Clinton and her followers in 2008</a>: When you have a mass movement, you owe it to your supporters to fight as long as possible\u2014to fight, in the words of Bill Clinton, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5atSIlRfdo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">until the last dog dies</a>.\u201d As Howard Wolfson, Clinton\u2019s onetime communications director,<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-delegate-quit-222503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> told Politico</a> about the 2008 race, \u201cYour head told you the math didn\u2019t add up, but your heart said, we\u2019re continuing to win states, we\u2019re continuing to draw big crowds, and it\u2019s very hard to walk away from a contest when you have millions of supporters who are clearly still determined to help you get elected.\u201d</p><p>The fact that<span> </span><span>S</span><span>anders, this late in the race, can draw a majority of voters in Indiana means his revolution has yet to run its course.

The delegates he continues to rack up will give him a greater voice in the convention and allow his supporters to shape the party platform.</span></p><p>The counter-argument is that by continuing to fight, Sanders will weaken Hillary Clinton and make a President Donald Trump more likely.

The aftermath of President Obama\u2019s reelection was, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/10294226/immigration-cruz-rubio-amnesty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">in Cruz\u2019s telling</a>, a time for choosing, and Marco Rubio disgracefully chose amnesty. More recently, Cruz described Tuesday night\u2019s Indiana primary as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tedcruzpage/posts/10154104561202464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">time for choosing</a>,\u201d suggesting that those who chose Trump over him would be welcoming the darkness. </p><p>Cruz\u2019s plea worked about as well on his own behalf as Reagan\u2019s did on Goldwater\u2019s. Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">demolished Cruz</a> in Indiana, leaving no doubt that he will win the Republican presidential primary on the first ballot in Cleveland two months from now. News networks called the race for Trump the moment polls closed in Indiana, and an hour-and-a-half later, Cruz <a href=\"/minutes/133277/ted-cruz-out-donald-trump-presumptive-nominee\">ended his campaign</a>.</p><p>He delivered his concession speech with an eye toward the future of conservatism\u2014a movement he offered to lead\u2014but was silent on the near-term, and conspicuously omitted two words: Donald Trump.</p><p>That means a time for choosing is now, fittingly, upon Cruz\u2014along with a whole array of conservatives who have either vowed to oppose Trump\u2019s candidacy through November, or who\u2019ve implied in their critiques that Trump is unfit for office. Their decisions will help determine what the Republican Party looks like after Trump, and whether the conservative movement comes out of the 2016 election diminished or extinct. And nobody\u2019s choice will matter more than Cruz\u2019s.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Cruz has never been explicitly in league with the #NeverTrump camp.

A month earlier, Cruz had <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/cruz-trump-tax-returns-may-include-bombshell-mafia-ties-n527521\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">intimated</a> that Trump might be reluctant to release his tax returns because they\u2019d reveal his \u201cbusiness dealings with the mob, with the mafia.\u201d And for weeks now, he has claimed, rather desperately, that Trump is essentially no different than Hillary Clinton\u2014\u201c<a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2016/05/03/watch-ted-cruz-lists-5-ways-trump-just-like-hillary-clinton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Behind the Donald Trump mask is Hillary Clinton</a>\u201d\u2014raising the question of what difference it makes whether Republicans back Trump, Clinton, or nobody.</p><p>On Tuesday, as Indiana Republicans were going to the polls, Cruz prefaced a comprehensive attack on Trump by effectively admitting that his own previous Trump comments were either disingenuous (for instance: \u201c@realDonaldTrump is terrific\u201d), or that he had been pulling his punches in his critiques. <span>\u201cI\u2019m going to do something I haven\u2019t done for the entire campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump.\u201d </span></p><figure class=\"article-embed\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/SASpMI_8QjE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></figure><p>This was likely the first tirade in the modern history of American political combat to address a rival\u2019s supposed \u201cbattles with venereal disease.\u201d Cruz delivered it knowing it would be his last word on Trump before ceding the nomination to him. He also knows that at some point in the next several weeks, he will have to choose between his conservative values and his partisan obligation to help someone he just called \u201camoral\u201d and a \u201cpathological liar\u201d become the president of the United States. </p><p>Other conservatives have paved the walk of shame for Cruz, should he decide to fall into line. Weeks after calling Trump a con man, and saying the thought of supporting Trump in the general election was \u201cgetting harder every day,\u201d Rubio said Trump\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/rubio-trumps-performance-has-improved-significantly/article/2002199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">performance has improved significantly</a>,\u201d and suggested he will help unite the party if Trump wins the GOP nomination.</p><p>But Cruz\u2019s shame would be greater still. Cruz has gone out of his way to say that he withheld his true assessment of Trump until the ultimate moment for choosing. That assessment is more unsparing than any Republican\u2019s criticism of Hillary Clinton, let alone of Trump himself. And as a leader of the conservative movement, Cruz\u2019s loyalties are more divided than just about any of his fellow partisans\u2019.<br></p><p>Cruz\u2019s options are uniquely terrible. His best bet may be to escape the public eye until November, in the hope of saying, <i>I told you so</i>.</p><p>If Cruz decides to lead a conservative splinter party, or a loyal-but-vocal Republican opposition, it\u2019ll allow the Trump faction to spin up a stabbed-in-the-back story about why the GOP nominee lost in November, and thus make<b> </b>uniting a single post-Trump party of the American right impossible.<b> <br></b></p><p><span>In any case, as #NeverTrump morphs into #EventuallyTrump, the power and prestige of the existing conservative movement will drain away, along with the logic and allure of leading an anti-Trump resistance</span><span>.</span></p><p>That will make it tempting for Cruz to cozy up to Trump. But if he does, he would take everything that he claimed distinguished him from the Republican establishment and flush it down the toilet. By what consistent principle can a man who shut the government down in hopeless protest of Obamacare turn around and endorse someone who\u2019s supposedly <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/03/politics/ted-cruz-steve-lonegan-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hillary Clinton with a penis</a><span>?</span></p><p>Cruz has, throughout his brief political career, shown an amazing facility for building himself up at the expense of other Republicans. His following remains real, and probably large enough that if Trump weren\u2019t practically destined to lose the general election anyhow, he could deny Trump the presidency all on his own simply by refusing to back him. </p><p>If anyone has the blind ambition required to oppose his own party\u2019s presidential nominee, hoping it will pay professional dividends in the future, it is Cruz. Conservative intellectuals have been by-and-large suspicious of Cruz\u2019s tactics and motives all along, precisely because of that overwhelming ambition. But to the extent that they take their Trump opposition seriously, Cruz has perversely become their best hope for enduring influence over politics. And if Cruz eventually makes his peace with Trump, then movement conservatism will be well and truly dead.</p><p><i>For more on the 2016 elections, take a listen to our podcast, </i>Primary Concerns<i>, hosted by Brian Beutler:</i></p><figure class=\"article-embed\"><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"//w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/261269583%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-z7vIt&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></figure>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133266/ted-cruzs-time-choosing</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133266</guid><category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ted Cruz]]></category><category><![CDATA[Marco Rubio]]></category><category><![CDATA[Republican Primary 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ronald Reagan]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Brian Beutler]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 02:05:32 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/5c411f1b8295eb6ab1b94fbe6d25c0201fc66577.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The New Face of India Is the Anti-Gandhi]]></title><description><![CDATA[<hr class=\"section-break\"><p>In September 2014, at Madison Square Garden in New York, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/nyregion/at-madison-square-garden-chants-cheers-and-roars-for-modi.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">addressed</a> a crowd of nearly 20,000 people. It was a <a href=\"http://time.com/3442490/india-narendra-modi-madison-square-garden/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold-out spectacle</a> worthy of a lush Bollywood production, with dancers warming up the audience and giant screens flashing portraits of Modi in the style of Shepard Fairey\u2019s 2008 Barack Obama \u201cHope\u201d posters.

He <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/09/28/live-blog-indias-narendra-modi-speaks-at-madison-square-garden/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">spoke</a> of its special prowess in information technology and the particular role played by Indian-Americans in this. He spoke of India\u2019s youthful population, with 65 percent of its billion-plus people under 35; of Make in India, a program that encapsulated his plans to transform the country into a manufacturing powerhouse along the lines of China; and the ways in which his humble origins and meteoric political ascent served as an example of what might be possible in India today.</p><p>This address was followed by many <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/09/narendra-modi-the-divisive-manipulator-who-charmed-the-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">similar ones</a> around the world, but it was the first to establish on a global stage an idea that had been doing the rounds, in India, in the Indian diaspora, and among Western nations keen to carry out business in India: Modi and India were versions of each other, doppelgangers marching through the world and conveying a new era. Even Barack Obama <a href=\"http://time.com/3823155/narendra-modi-2015-time-100/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">made the comparison</a>, writing in <i>Time</i>\u2019s annual list of the hundred most influential people in the world: \u201cAs a boy, Narendra Modi helped his father sell tea to support their family. Today, he\u2019s the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy, and his life story\u2014from poverty to prime minister\u2014<span>reflects the dynamism and potential of India\u2019s rise.\u201d</span></p><p>Dynamism, potential, rise: These are the states of being captured by the entwinement of India and Modi. In the minds of India\u2019s elite, and in that of an admiring, supportive West, India has been <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/a-richer-future-for-india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rising</a> for a while, ever since it fully embraced Western capitalism in the early 1990s. Modi\u2019s Madison Square Garden appearance was but an expression of that ascendance, from slumdogs into millionaires. But Modi was also in New York because of something that accompanies the rising India narrative: the perplexing reality that having been rising for so long, India is still not risen.</p><p>In the past 15 years, the top 1 percent of earners in India have <a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Money/VL5yuBxydKzZHMetfC97HL/Richest-1-own-53-of-Indias-wealth.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">increased their share</a> of the country\u2019s wealth from 36.8 percent to 53 percent, with the top 10 percent owning 76.3 percent, and yet India remains a stunningly <a href=\"http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/country/home/tags/india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">poor country</a>, riven with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2012/12/29/india-rape-victim-dies-sexual-violence-proble/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">violence</a> and brutal <a href=\"http://asiasociety.org/education/indian-society-and-ways-living\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hierarchies</a>, held together with shoddy <a href=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2011/09/04/2003512399\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">infrastructure</a>, and marked by the ravages of lopsided growth, <a href=\"http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/02/23/india-air-pollution-is-now-worse-than-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pollution</a>, and climate change. Modi at Madison Square Garden, then, stood for the promise that India\u2019s rise would finally be completed, the summit reached. It had not yet been achieved, but he would change that. He would change it because he was an outsider, a man of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/05/16/312815932/narendra-modi-from-humble-start-to-indias-likely-prime-minister\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">humble origins</a>, leading a political party\u2014the Hindu right <a href=\"http://www.bjp.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> (BJP)\u2014that had a few months earlier been given a clear electoral majority, the first time for any Indian party in <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/after-30-yrs-of-coalition-unfamiliarity-of-one-party-rule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">30 years</a>. He was at Madison Square Garden to mark this triumph, and to declare himself the new Indian icon for a new Indian century. </p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\"><p>Adulation and violence, sanctimoniousness and abuse, are never far from Modi and his supporters.</p></aside><p>Modi referred, naturally, to the icon he had supplanted, the one from a previous century. Stumbling over Gandhi\u2019s first name, calling him \u201cMohanlal\u201d instead of \u201cMohandas,\u201d Modi <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gandhi-was-an-nri-like-you-pm-narendra-modi-at-madison-square-garden-672247\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">compared</a> Gandhi to the members of his audience, as a person who had lived abroad as a diaspora Indian before returning to India. Modi\u2019s Gandhi, however, had nothing to do with anticolonial politics, mysticism, or nonviolence. Those had been left behind with the old India, as demonstrated by some of Modi\u2019s supporters outside the venue. Gathered in large numbers, they <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/world/asia/indian-anchors-scuffle-in-new-york-draws-supporters-and-critics.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">heckled and jeered</a> at the Indian television anchor <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/anchor/rajdeep-sardesai/1/411950.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rajdeep Sardesai</a> for being part of what they saw as the liberal wing of the Indian media, which is ill-disposed toward Modi. To Sardesai\u2019s attempts to ask them questions, they responded with shouts of \u201cModi, Modi, Modi.\u201d When he retorted, \u201cDid Mr. Modi tell you to behave badly? Did America tell you to behave badly?\u201d a <a href=\"http://www.india.com/news/india/most-definitive-rajdeep-sardesai-video-released-detailed-analysis-to-find-the-aggressor-at-madison-square-garden-174981/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">brawl ensued</a>, some of the men chanting, \u201c<i><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5780570\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vande Mataram</a>,\u201d</i> or \u201cPraise Mother India,\u201d while others shouted, \u201cMotherfucker.\u201d </p><p>This episode could be seen as an aberration, but the combination of adulation and violence, sanctimoniousness and abuse, is never far from Modi and those who support him. It is, in fact, the essence of his appeal. He is a representative Indian not merely because he signifies potential, outsider status, and an Indian form of DIY upward mobility, but also because he embodies violent sectarian and authoritarian tendencies: so much a modern man belonging to the new century that he has dispensed with the pacifism associated with Gandhi.</p><p>One could see that in the jostling bodies and shouting faces gathered around the Indian television anchor. At work, these clean-cut, middle-class Indian men in their saffron t-shirts displaying Modi\u2019s face probably exuded deference and respectability, at least toward those they associated with power and wealth. But gathered in numbers, with their puffed-up chests and clenched fists, they replicated what they admired most about Modi\u2014a kind of unmoored nihilism that dresses itself in religious colors and acts through violence, that is ruthlessly authoritarian in the face of diversity and dissent, and that imprints the brute force of its majoritarianism wherever it is in power.</p><p>During his speech, Modi told the crowd the <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-speaks-at-madison-square-garden-highlights-672256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">story</a> of an interpreter in Taiwan who had asked him if India was a land of black magic, with snakes and snake charmers. This drew nervous laughter from the men and women in their professional clothes. The story was in a familiar genre, that of the Indian humiliated abroad, and can be found even in Gandhi\u2019s accounts of colonialism and racism when traveling to the West. For Gandhi and his contemporaries (and in fact for all colonized, marginalized cultures), that experience of humiliation had led sometimes to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34265882\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a kind of nativism</a>\u2014a reaffirmation of the superior values of one\u2019s humiliated society\u2014but it had also provoked an anticolonialism that was internationalist in spirit, identifying with other marginalized groups.</p><p>But Modi was speaking for a new India and to a new India, one obsessed with completing its rise as an economic power. Neither the speaker nor the crowd acknowledged that snake charming in India is an occupation based on caste, and that they were far removed from such livelihoods. They were simply angry, afraid, and humiliated that their Indianness could be tainted by such associations, and it is not hard to empathize with that sense of being patronized. But where the anticolonial, Gandhi-inspired Indian might have worn the snake-charmer tag as a badge of pride, the new, Modi Indian merely wanted it destroyed. The new Indian instinctively understood the point of Modi\u2019s anecdote, which was that it was set in Taiwan, not a Western country, but still ahead of India in terms of modernity.</p><p>\u201cOur country has become very devalued,\u201d Modi <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-speaks-at-madison-square-garden-highlights-672256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a>. Cheers resounded through the stadium, the well-dressed professionals at Madison Square Garden united in their common sense of humiliation. Modi waited for the cheers to die down. Then he said, \u201cOur ancestors used to play with snakes. We play with the <i>mouse</i>.\u201d The applause this time was deafening. In the twist of a metaphor, Modi had restored the honor of the nation and of all those present. India was not a nation of snake charmers but of high-tech mouse managers. And Modi understood this, because he too was an Indian driven by rage and humiliation, a newcomer to the system and a latecomer to modernity, a leader who would transform India into a land of Silicon Valley white magic, but who would retain its authentic Hindu core. </p><p>Listening to the crowd finishing off his call-and-response of \u201c<i>Bharat Mata Ki </i>\u2026 ,\u201d he said, \u201cClose both your fists and say it with full strength.\u201d The crowd rose, fists clenched, shouting out the promise of triumph, of victory: \u201c<i>Bharat Mata Ki Jai!</i>\u201d</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>In 1893, more than a century before Modi appeared at Madison Square Garden, a Hindu preacher called <a href=\"http://isha.sadhguru.org/blog/sadhguru/masters-words/stories-swami-vivekananda-life-inspired/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vivekananda</a> arrived in Chicago. The popular version of the story, as told in India, describes him as a solitary, charismatic figure dressed in saffron robes and turban as he faced the harsh cold and desiccated materialism of the West. The more prosaic, if still dramatic, truth is that Vivekananda had come to attend the <a href=\"https://www.parliamentofreligions.org/parliament/chicago-1893\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">World\u2019s Parliament of Religions</a>, a sideshow to that year\u2019s World\u2019s Fair.

After India became independent in 1947, Nathuram Godse, a former member of the RSS, assassinated Gandhi for being too conciliatory toward Muslims and Pakistan. The RSS was <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=KfexkkZbJ7AC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=RSS+was+banned+briefly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V13snthvZR&amp;sig=o75ZMhDOuJKy1I7QDuiNH6Sf08A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyhNCT9ZDMAhUFaz4KHWGXB3EQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">banned</a> briefly, but this was a blip in its steady expansion from its base in the Western state of Maharashtra into neighboring Gujarat, Modi\u2019s home state, and beyond. </p><p>The RSS was known for its secretive, cultlike tendencies; it kept no written fundraising records, and produced a constitution only in 1949 as a <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/written-constitution-was-indeed-a-precondition/article5237953.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">condition</a> for the lifting of its ban. It <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-forgotten-promise-of-1949/article5211026.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">stayed away</a> from anticolonial politics under the British and maintained a distance from electoral politics in the decades following independence. It focused, instead, on the ideal of an upper-caste Hindu society within an unabashedly upper-caste, patriarchal Hindu nation. It recruited boys between the ages of six and 18, using doctrinaire lectures and a routine of paramilitary drills to mold their Hindu \u201cRace Spirit,\u201d while its adult members were <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=e9_bsysRUdQC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">unleashed</a> as shock troops in riots against Muslims. It maintained links with Hindu-right political parties and Congress leaders favorably inclined to its sectarian idea of India, but avoided direct involvement in parliamentary politics, calling itself a social organization rather than a political one. </p><p>This was the organization\u2014disciplined, secretive, tainted by its association with Gandhi\u2019s assassination and its role in sectarian riots\u2014that Modi <a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned-narendra-modi-profile/3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">joined</a> in 1958 as an eight-year-old in the provincial Gujarati town of Vadnagar. He was the third of six children, from a family that <a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned-narendra-modi-profile/3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ran a tea shop</a> at the railway station to supplement its income from pressing and selling cooking oil. Leaving home as a teenager, Modi wandered the country, possibly to escape living with the wife who had been chosen for him in an arranged marriage at an early age\u2014ironically, just the sort of social practice defended by the Hindu right, despite legislative attempts to make marriage and divorce more equitable, especially for Hindu women\u2014and from whom he remains estranged. He returned after a couple of years to the Gujarati city of Ahmedabad, where he briefly ran a tea stall before joining the RSS full-time. Modi soon completed the RSS\u2019s one-month officer-training program and became a <i><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ecFgAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT206&amp;lpg=PT206&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pracharak</a>,</i> or organizer.</p><p>One can see the attractions of the RSS for a young man like Modi, filled with ambition and intelligence but without much education or opportunity. Its warrior-monk structure would offer upward mobility and power even as its cultish ideology stoked a sense of humiliation about the place of India in the world, and of Hindus within India. Decades later, when Modi wrote a book entitled <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.in/Jyotipunj-Narendra-Modi/dp/8173156956\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jyotipunj</a></i> (Beams of light) about the people he admired most, his list would consist exclusively of RSS members, <a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/modi-golwalkar-part-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foremost among them</a> the Hitler-loving Golwalkar. Modi rose rapidly through the ranks of this organization, one not dissimilar\u2014in its paranoia, violence, and sense of victimization\u2014to the Ku Klux Klan. There were always questions about his egocentricism, such as his tendency to wear a beard rather than the look encouraged by the RSS\u2014military mustache or clean-shaven\u2014and his tendency to upstage his rivals, but he was an efficient organizer in an outfit that needed these skills as it became more directly involved in influencing electoral politics.</p><p>The RSS had always maintained a loose affiliation with Hindu political parties. As the BJP emerged in the 1980s as the primary political party of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/05/economist-explains-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Hindu right</a>, led by men who were also members of the RSS, that relationship grew stronger, until the BJP, the RSS, and a range of other Hindu-right organizations formed what in India is called the <i>Sangh parivar,</i> or \u201c<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/05/economist-explains-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sangh Family</a>.\u201d The BJP\u2019s task has been to provide the political face of the <i>Sangh parivar</i>, while the RSS remains its shadowy soul. </p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed full-width\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/836c0eb21c24ddbba4457b5a69d2238e8e2f0045.jpeg?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;08f03015-4468-445b-aa15-3a4c26afc5bb&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;836c0eb21c24ddbba4457b5a69d2238e8e2f0045&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:4985,&quot;height&quot;:3323,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/836c0eb21c24ddbba4457b5a69d2238e8e2f0045.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"><figcaption><span class=\"caption-text\">Modi, at the G-20 summit in Australia in 2014, has taken his place among the world\u2019s leaders. </span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Mark Nolan/Getty </span></figcaption></figure><p>The Hindu right, especially the BJP, grew in influence as the Congress, India\u2019s main political party, weakened. By the 1980s, the Congress, dominated by the Nehru-Gandhi family, had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/16/what-next-india-pankaj-mishra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">begun to dabble</a> in sectarian politics and Hindu nationalism. When Indira Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh separatists in 1984, senior Congress <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2610663/Sting-operation-says-police-let-1984-rioters-run-free.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">leaders</a>, joined by RSS members, directed a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/08/world/sikhs-kill-14-hindus-after-executions-in-india.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pogrom</a> against the Sikh minority that resulted in the death of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/29/india-no-justice-1984-anti-sikh-bloodshed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2,700 people</a>, according to official estimates. Rajiv Gandhi, the next prime minister, took his mother\u2019s sectarian politics further while also beginning India\u2019s tilt toward the United States and toward information technology and a market-driven economy. This process would create a new Indian elite that was both aggressive and insecure about its place in the market economy, something it compensated for by reconfiguring itself as narrowly Hindu.</p><p>The BJP profited from these trends, using the RSS philosophy of <i>Hindutva</i> (Hindu-ness) plus <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=XAO3i_gS61wC&amp;pg=PA333&amp;lpg=PA333&amp;dq=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the slogan</a>, \u201cSay with pride that we\u2019re Hindus,\u201d to go from two seats in the national parliament in 1984 to 85 in 1989, beginning <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ptlBlpV9ZdQC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a steady rise</a> that, after a brief dip in 2004 and 2009, culminated in 282 seats, or 51.9 percent of the total, in the 2014 elections that made Modi prime minister. </p><p>There were significant opportunities for Modi as the Hindu right expanded its sectarian politics. The first, and most pivotal, campaign of the Hindu right involved a movement in 1990 to rebuild a temple to Rama, the mythological hero of the <i>Ramayana</i>, on the disputed site of the Babri Masjid, a sixteenth-century mosque in Ayodhya, in northern India. The BJP leader at the time, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/bic-picture-temple-rerun-tracing-bjps-ram-rath-yatra-25-years-later/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">L.K. Advani</a>, rode a Toyota truck modified into a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/16/what-next-india-pankaj-mishra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chariot</a>\u201d around the country to rally Hindus to the cause, starting his journey at Somnath in Gujarat, where a temple had been destroyed in the eleventh century by a Central Asian Muslim invader, and <a href=\"http://www.bjp.org/leadership/shri-lk-advani/yatras/?u=ram-rath-yatra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">traveling</a> towards Babri Masjid. </p><p>Modi was RSS general secretary at the time, a position that entailed directing the BJP from behind the scenes, making sure that it was following the RSS\u2019s agenda. He organized the opening segment of the tour, and old photographs show him standing next to Advani on the chariot. In a sign of things to come, the temple campaign went global, shored up by other members of the <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/the-ram-temple-drama/article797089.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sangh Family</a>, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or <a href=\"https://www.vhp-america.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Hindu Council</a>, which focuses much of its energies on the Indian diaspora in the West. Hindus around the world were asked to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=mFzmCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">donate bricks</a> to build the temple to Ram. Bricks, some made of gold, arrived from abroad as well as from hundreds of villages and towns in India, and although Advani\u2019s tour ended when he was <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UpK7oyb0kvkC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">arrested</a> for inciting violence, the mobilization continued. On December 6, 1992, Babri Masjid was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/6/newsid_3712000/3712777.stm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">leveled</a> by a Hindu-right mob, setting off a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11435240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">spiral of violence</a> that resulted in the death of around 2,000 people. </p><p>The violence of the Ayodhya campaign, the crudeness of depictions of Muslims as brutal invaders, the deft use of political spectacle, and the targeting of all this toward a new Indian elite both ambitious and insecure, were trends that Modi would embrace and develop. In 1995, he <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9roVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14&amp;lpg=PT14&amp;dq=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">became</a> BJP national secretary and moved to Delhi, just as India began its conversion to a full-fledged market economy and embarked on a period of economic growth that would benefit the urban elites enormously. The market, the nation, and Hindutva converged as the <a href=\"http://www.elections.in/parliamentary-constituencies/1998-election-results.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BJP won the elections in 1998</a>, the new government carrying out a <a href=\"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaShakti.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">series of nuclear tests</a> to celebrate the victory. A year later, it fought a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/south_asia/2002/india_pakistan/timeline/1999.stm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">brief war</a> with Pakistan. The nuclear tests and the war were promoted hysterically by media outlets that were consumed eagerly by a growing urban elite, drawing in even liberal Indians who might have been uneasy about the Ayodhya campaign but who liked the way this new India asserted itself on the global stage. </p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>In October 2001, Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat by the BJP leadership in Delhi. It was the <a href=\"http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1821/18210310.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">first time</a> an RSS <i>pracharak</i> had become chief executive of an Indian state. The impact was apparent soon afterward. In February 2002, 59 Hindus returning from the tenth-anniversary celebration of the destruction of Babri Masjid <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4180885.stm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">died in a fire</a> that broke out in a train compartment. Investigations would later point to the fire originating inside the carriage, perhaps from a malfunctioning cooking-gas cylinder, but the Hindu right accused Muslims of storming the train and setting it on fire. Modi flew to the site. Orders were given for the corpses to be brought to Ahmedabad in a convoy of trucks. The corpses were then <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/06/world/asia/modi-gujarat-riots-timeline.html?_r=1#/#time287_8190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">displayed</a> in the open on the hospital grounds, apparently for the purpose of postmortem examinations, as agitated crowds watched the grisly spectacle. </p><p>A retaliatory campaign of extermination by Hindu mobs against Muslims began hours later and lasted for more than two months, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/06/world/asia/modi-gujarat-riots-timeline.html?_r=0#/#time287_8192\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">resulting</a> in the death of more than 1,000 people and the displacement of 150,000. Women and girls were raped before being mutilated and set on fire. Homes, shops, restaurants, and mosques were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/27/international/asia/27INDI.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">looted and burned</a>. The attackers, reportedly guided by <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/india/gujarat.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">computer printouts</a> that listed the addresses of Muslim families, were on many occasions aided by the police or led by legislators in Modi\u2019s government. Many of the killers were identified as belonging to various Hindu right organizations. \u201cEighteen people from my family died,\u201d a survivor of the onslaught said in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2002/04/30/we-have-no-orders-save-you/state-participation-and-complicity-communal-violence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">We Have No Orders to Save You</a>,\u201d a 2002 report from Human Rights Watch. \u201cAll the women died. My brother, my three sons, one girl, my wife\u2019s mother, they all died. My boys were aged ten, eight, and six. My girl was twelve years old. The bodies were piled up. I recognized them from parts of their clothes used for identification.\u201d </p><p>Even by the macabre standards of mass murder in India, there was something unusually disturbing about the Gujarat massacres. They had taken place in a relatively prosperous state, among people given to trade and business, rather than in a less-developed part of the country where a link might be made between deprivation and rage. But this connection in Gujarat, between economic prosperity and primal, sectarian violence, became one of the defining aspects of Modi\u2019s image, in India and among the diaspora, one reaffirming the other, the pride of wealth meeting the pride of identity. </p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-left\"><p>Modi\u2019s Gandhi had nothing to do with anticolonialism or nonviolence. Those had been left behind with the old India.</p></aside><p>In the aftermath of the massacres, Modi demonstrated <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/27/international/asia/27INDI.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">not a shred of remorse or regret</a>. In fact, he decided early on to turn questions about the massacres and his role in them into an attack on Gujarat, and on India, especially when the Bush administration decided, in 2005, to <a href=\"http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/sca/rls/rm/2005/43701.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">deny Modi a diplomatic visa</a> and revoked his tourist/business visa for the \u201cparticularly severe violations of religious freedom\u201d that had taken place under him. </p><p>In 2007, when asked by Karan Thapar, the host of a show on the Indian television channel CNN-IBN, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you say that you regret the killings that happened? Why can\u2019t you say maybe the government should have done more to protect Muslims?\u201d Modi <a href=\"http://www.telegraphindia.com/1071021/asp/nation/story_8458254.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">walked out</a> of the interview. In 2013, as he was emerging as a prime ministerial candidate, Modi responded to a similar question with a convoluted analogy. \u201cIf someone else is driving, and we are sitting in the back seat, and even then if a small <i>kutte ka baccha</i> comes under the wheel, do we feel pain or not? We do.\u201d <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2013/07/12/interview-with-bjp-leader-narendra-modi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reuters</a> translated <i>kutte ka baccha</i> as \u201cpuppy,\u201d which, while technically accurate, missed the point: <i>Kutte ka baccha</i>, or \u201cprogeny of a dog,\u201d is an <a href=\"http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130713/jsp/frontpage/story_17112818.jsp#.VxFSp85Xbds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">insult</a>. </p><p>Modi also began to say that he had been given \u201c<a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2013/07/12/interview-with-bjp-leader-narendra-modi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a clean chit</a>\u201d about his role in the massacres by a team appointed by the Indian Supreme Court. His legions of supporters modified this statement, endlessly <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-celebrates-clean-chit-to-modi/article5504750.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">repeating</a> that the Supreme Court had cleared him of any culpability in relation to the massacres. Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya, economists at Columbia University, wrote to <i><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/letters/21592586-narendra-modi-california-cuba-dominican-republic-patents-academic-publishing \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Economist</a></i> asserting this, arguing that what the magazine had earlier called a \u201cpogrom\u201d was really a riot and that a quarter of those killed were Hindus. In some ways, this response is almost as disturbing as what happened during the massacres themselves. Modi\u2019s supporters were willing to ignore the question of responsibility for the sake of what they saw as the higher priority of a new India, now a superpower respected by the West. Large sections of the liberal Indian intelligentsia, writers and opinion makers, have chosen to remain silent. And then there are those who approve of Modi, knowing that he has been able to address all of new India\u2019s fantasies and fears in a way not achieved by any other comparable leader, taking it to great heights as an emerging capitalist power, asserting its place in the world, and unleashing its dark, nihilistic violence on marginalized people.</p><p>As for Modi\u2019s \u201cclean chit,\u201d the devil is in the details. Modi, who is supposed to have been absolved by the Supreme Court, has never actually been tried by it. The Supreme Court was <a href=\"http://www.cjponline.org/zakia/Zakia%20CJP%20SLP%201088%20of%202008%20final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">petitioned</a> in 2008 by Citizens for Peace and Justice (CPJ), an advocacy group seeking justice for the victims of the massacres. Led by Teesta Setalvad, a Gujarati activist, the CPJ expressed its fear that the judicial process in Gujarat was compromised, in response to which the Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gujarat-riots-case-special-investigation-team-refuses-to-share-report-with-petitioners-573897\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">appointed</a> a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into a select number of cases. In 2009, the court also asked the SIT to <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/timeline-zakia-jafri-vs-modi-in-2002-gujarat-riots-case/story-QDDWYZwlGgn3we3RsATthP.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigate</a> a petition against Modi related to his involvement in the massacres, which was initiated by Zakia Jafri, whose husband, Ehsan Jafri, a Congress politician, was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-18031124\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">killed</a> during them; she had previously approached the Gujarat police and the Gujarat High Court to no avail. </p><p>The SIT\u2019s final report in 2012 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/world/asia/india-opposition-leader-will-not-be-charged-over-riots.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=32B2DC9BF55F6C3BF0CAB15FD40C69D5&amp;gwt=pay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">concluded</a> that there was not enough evidence to prosecute Modi. But, as the journalist Hartosh Singh Bal (my close friend and former colleague) pointed out in <i><a href=\"http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/nation/will-we-ever-know-the-truth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open</a></i>, a current affairs magazine, those conclusions differed dramatically from the evidence in the report itself. One is left with the impression that the SIT was eager to find a lack of evidence no matter how much evidence actually existed. Maybe the SIT was right to be cautious.

He called for the cross-examination of Sanjiv Bhatt, a Gujarat police officer who had earlier stated that he was present at a meeting during which Modi directed the police to allow Hindus to vent their rage. </p><p>The overall tendency of Modi\u2019s government was, as Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/tag/gujarat-riots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">described</a> in its report, one of \u201csubverting justice, protecting perpetrators, and intimidating those promoting accountability.\u201d Government officials seen as loyal to Modi, and under whose watch some of the worst killings took place, were <a href=\"http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/meet-the-23-cops-who-embody-gujarat-s-carrot-and-stick-policy-1440404009.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rewarded</a> with promotions and cushy posts. Those who provided evidence that raised questions about his role in the massacres found themselves subject to disciplinary measures, legal prosecution, threats, and scandals. </p><p>Three police officers who gave the National Commission for Minorities a transcript of a public speech delivered by Modi seven months after the massacres, in which he called camps set up for displaced Muslims \u201cbaby-producing centers,\u201d were summarily <a href=\"http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/sep/18guj2.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">transferred</a>. R.B. Sreekumar, a senior police officer who testified to a commission set up by the Gujarat government to investigate the train fire and the massacres, which was headed initially by a single retired judge considered to be a Modi loyalist, was <a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/naroda-patiya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">denied promotion</a> and charged by the government with giving out \u201cclassified information.\u201d He had <a href=\"http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/nation/will-we-ever-know-the-truth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">recorded</a> a session during which a senior Modi official had coached him about how he should answer questions, including \u201ctell[ing] the commission that no better steps could be taken\u201d in terms of preventing the violence. Rahul Sharma, a police officer who gave the commission phone records allegedly proving that killers involved in the massacres had regularly been in touch with politicians and police officers, was <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gujarat-riots-whistleblower-cop-rahul-sharma-chargesheeted-by-modi-govt-464466\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">charged</a> by the Gujarat government with violating the state\u2019s Official Secrets Act. Haren Pandya, a minister in the Gujarat government who became a bitter rival of Modi\u2019s, and who testified in secret to an independent fact-finding panel about the riots, was <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-ats-arrest-man-in-connection-with-2003-jihadi-conspiracy-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">murdered</a> in March 2003, after he was publicly identified as a whistle-blower and forced to resign his ministerial post. A dozen men, supposedly Islamist terrorists, were arrested for Pandya\u2019s murder; all of them were <a href=\"http://www.rediff.com/news/report/haren-pandya-murder-case-shut-but-mystery-unsolved/20111017.htm \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquitted</a> eight years later. Pandya\u2019s father maintained that Modi had orchestrated the killing.</p><p>In contrast, those who were indicted and sentenced to imprisonment for taking part in the massacres seemed to have a benevolent, gentle state looking out for their well-being. Maya Kodnani, an RSS member and BJP legislator, named by Modi as the Gujarat Minister for Women and Child Development in 2007, was in 2012 <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bail-for-maya-kodnani-former-modi-minister-jailed-for-2002-gujarat-riots-540782\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sentenced</a> to 28 years in prison for leading a mob that killed 95 people, including 32 women and 33 children. In 2014, she was let out on <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gujarat-high-court-grants-bail-suspends-sentence-of-maya-kodnani/article6264567.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">furlough</a> due to poor health, and she has since been spotted taking <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/selfie-of-ex-minister-maya-kodnani-jailed-for-2002-riots-sparks-anger-1246693\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">selfies</a> at a yoga retreat on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. Babu Bajrangi, a leader in the Bajrang Dal, a militant faction, who was also convicted for his role in the Gujarat massacres, <a href=\"http://www.tehelka.com/2007/11/to-get-me-out-on-bail-narendrabhai-changed-judges-thrice/?singlepage=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">told</a> the investigative magazine <i>Tehelka</i> in 2007 that Modi was \u201ca real man\u201d who had changed judges on his behalf on a number of occasions to get him out of jail.

The number of girls born in Gujarat compared to boys <a href=\"http://countryoffice.unfpa.org/india/drive/MissingGirlsBrochure_LowResPDF.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">remains low</a>, suggesting a continued bias for male children in a country known for its grotesquely patriarchal norms; and yet the state is in the forefront of providing <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/gujarat-a-hub-of-rent-a-womb-industry-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">surrogate mothers</a> for wealthy Western populations. </p><p>Much was made of Modi\u2019s decision in 2008 to allow the Indian automobile manufacturer Tata to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-10-08/india-modi-wins-as-gujarat-gets-tatas-nano-plantbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">open</a> a car factory in Gujarat, in particular after an attempt to do so in the traditionally left-leaning state of West Bengal had resulted in a violent farmers\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/22/tata.nano\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">uprising</a>.

A new city on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, constructed by architects brought in from Shanghai and touted, in 2012, as \u201cthe largest urbanization project in Indian history,\u201d turned out, three years later, as <i><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-india-a-gift-waiting-to-be-opened-1438075981\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Wall Street Journal</a> </i>reported, to consist of mostly empty office buildings. </p><p>In an Independence Day speech last August, Modi modified his \u201cMake in India\u201d slogan to a more contemporary \u201c<a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Politics/1lKoE0HjYzjdtb4D5ezzNJ/Startup-India-Standup-India-Modi-tells-nation-in-ID-spee.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Startup India</a>.\u201d But there was little about the wealth created under Modi that had to do with technological innovation. It depended instead on heedless resource extraction, crony capitalism, and competition for outsourcing work handed out by the West, all of which has been visible in India for decades. In Modi\u2019s case, this was exemplified by his <a href=\"http://www.dailyo.in/politics/how-modi-has-placed-his-old-friends-adani-and-torrent-on-the-high-table/story/1/1566.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">closeness</a> to the Gujarati billionaire Gautam Adani, who had come swiftly to Modi\u2019s defense when the latter was criticized for the 2002 massacres. In November 2014, Adani accompanied Modi to the G-20 summit in Australia, a country in which he hoped to dig one of the largest, and most controversial, coal mines in the world. Although a series of international banks refused to fund the project, voicing concerns about its environmental impact, Adani nevertheless received <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/state-bank-of-india-to-provide-up-to-1-bn-loan-for-adani-australia-coal-mine-698662\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a massive loan</a> from the State Bank of India. </p><p>The shortcomings of the Gujarat model are not particular to the state but to India as a whole. The difference is that Gujarat\u2019s supposed economic achievement helped distinguish Modi from other political leaders in India trying much the same things. So Gujarat was a success, even as India was something of a failure to the Indian elite supporting Modi\u2014a paradox that was resolved by making him prime minister.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>How, with the violent scandal and the political failure, to account for Modi\u2019s rise? The narrative of a growing India fed into it, stoked by the Indian elite and a Western media untrained to see nuances beyond the success of global capitalism in the aftermath of the cold war. The outsourcing of Western IT and office services played into it, as did the granting of visas to Indians to work in the West. Even the rise of a security state targeting Muslims found deep echoes in the West. The killing of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 came less than a year after the attacks of September 11, 2001, which meant that the old animosities of the Hindu right towards Muslims, Islam, and Pakistan found fertile ground in a United States whose wars abroad, in Afghanistan and then in Iraq, featured the same enemies. India was an ally in the marketplace and in the war against Islamism, and was a contrast to both the overly religious, anti-Western militancy that would consume Pakistan and the godless manipulators of market capitalism in China.</p><p>For many in the Indian diaspora, and for their upper-tier elite relatives back in India, the endless cover stories, op-ed articles, books, and films <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/16/what-next-india-pankaj-mishra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">praising the new India</a>\u2014even as Islam, Muslims, and Pakistan were regularly criticized as failed systems incompatible with modernity\u2014meant a kind of double bonus for their self-image, confirming their arrival as the white man\u2019s favorite kind of Indian. Thomas Friedman became a best-selling author and a hero to Indians with his account of rising India in <i><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/magazine/its-a-flat-world-after-all.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The World Is Flat</a></i>. It was a long way from Henry Kissinger\u2019s <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4640773.stm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">comments</a> in the 1970s that Indians were \u201cbastards\u201d and Indira Gandhi a \u201cbitch.\u201d All of this had been achieved not through Gandhian anticolonialism or the mystical self-abnegation associated with India by the counterculture in 1960s America, but through the materialist terms acceptable in contemporary America: money, long hours, and power.</p><p>The model minority status of the Indian diaspora in the United States was an uneasy one. It depended on an uncritical identification with the American ethos of success through work and competition, as well as with its counterpart, what Toni Morrison has <a href=\"http://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Morrison-On-the-Backs-of-Blacks.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">called</a> the \u201cmost enduring and efficient rite of passage into American culture: negative appraisals of the native-born black population.\u201d It meant attacks on the ideas of the <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-view/modi-government-one-year-of-dismantling-the-welfare-state/story-QTxNQWLK0bEDxMnwZl7vTO.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">welfare state</a>, of affirmative action, of impoverished and incarcerated minorities\u2014a method transferable back home through Modi and the Hindu right\u2019s assault on minorities and the poor and contemporary India\u2019s valorization of wealth maximization and conspicuous consumption. But the truth remained that India was not America, and the gilded elite of the former toasted their lifestyles in a context of far greater poverty, surrounded by <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/02/asia/india-poor-census-secc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hundreds of millions</a> of the dispossessed\u2014potentially militant and far too great in numbers to be housed in the prisons and reservations favored by America. The status quo remained fragile, easily disrupted, and it required not just a party or a program\u2014the BJP\u2019s rival, the Congress, favored the same kind of economics and national security state\u2014but a strong man like Modi who could grasp the present in both fists, as he had done in Gujarat. The West, with its selective talk of human rights, was an uncertain ally in this respect, desirable for its power but also resented for its superior status. Its approval, suddenly granted, could also be taken away, denied as easily as the visa refused to Modi in 2005.</p><p>Modi, at the time, was <a href=\"http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005-03-20/news/27471291_1_aahoa-convention-indian-american-hoteliers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">planning</a> to attend a U.S. trade convention of Asian-American hotel owners. With 700,000 Gujaratis living in the United States, probably the largest Indian group in the country, the State Department was well aware of the sensitivities involved. A <a href=\"http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/sca/rls/rm/2005/43701.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">press release about his visa denial</a> noted \u201cthe great respect the United States has for the many successful Gujaratis who live and work in the United States and the thousands who are issued visas to the United States each month.\u201d Yet Gujarati support (and it is worth reiterating that many Gujaratis have resisted Modi\u2019s sectarian agenda at great cost to themselves) formed only one strand in Modi\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/narendra-modi-india-overseas-diaspora-united-states\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">valorization</a> among Indians of Hindu origin in the diaspora, regardless of their ethnicity. Indians from minority faiths (Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians), and those belonging to progressive groups, kept a critical distance from Modi. These groups were instrumental in <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303380004579520041301275638\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pressuring</a> the United States into denying him a visa, and they later attempted to serve him with a <a href=\"http://www.americanjusticecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Modi_Summons__Complaint1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">legal summons</a> for genocide during his triumphal visit to Madison Square Garden. </p><p>For many in the Indian diaspora, however, the denial of Modi\u2019s visa highlighted the double standards of the West, especially since the Bush administration was hardly a benign power when it came to Muslims. It also confirmed the diaspora\u2019s suspicion of liberal factions in America, the media, universities, and the human rights sector, which they believed were out to humiliate Indians and Hindus by pointing out their deficiencies. The most visceral manifestation of these attitudes came in the writings and talks produced by <a href=\"http://infinityfoundation.com/people.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rajiv Malhotra</a>, an Indian based in New Jersey who fulminated against the conspiracy directed at Hindu India by Western academics in Western universities. Like Modi, he saw himself as a mouse manager taken for a snake charmer, a victim of those identified as enemies of Hindus by the RSS from its very inception\u2014Muslims, leftists, and the West. Malhotra, <a href=\"http://scroll.in/article/740814/plagiarism-row-how-rajiv-malhotra-became-the-ayn-rand-of-internet-hindutva\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">described</a> by the Indian journalist Shoaib Daniyal as the \u201cAyn Rand of internet Hindutva,\u201d was an early exponent of the inverted postcolonial doggerel common among Modi and his supporters. He <a href=\"http://infinityfoundation.com/index.shtml#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">spoke</a> of the \u201cEurocentric framework\u201d of Western academics writing about an \u201cindigenous non-Western civilization,\u201d while still himself uttering breathtaking essentialisms about white women, India\u2019s oppressed castes, African Americans, and \u201cAbrahamic religions.\u201d Long influential among the Indian diaspora in the United States, Malhotra had to wait for Modi to become prime minister to achieve full respectability in India.

He liked his Indian-American experts for the global aura they gave him and for the way they burnished his reputation as the Indian icon of the new century, committed to running India in a way it had never been run before. So, while the Indian diaspora\u2019s main fixation in the United States was a kind of cultural war\u2014attempts to <a href=\"http://www.equip.org/article/have-your-textbooks-been-saffronized/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">change</a> references to Hinduism in school textbooks, smear campaigns against <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/12/scholars-who-study-hinduism-and-india-face-hostile-climate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Western scholars of Hinduism</a>, and the introduction at universities of <a href=\"http://www.dcfusa.org/ http://www.dcfusa.org/about-us/initiatives/initiative-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">programs and chairs in Hinduism</a> that would be taught by individuals with questionable scholarly credentials but possessing the vital attribute of belonging to the faith\u2014in India it would focus on bringing about Modi\u2019s victory in the national elections.</p><p>Modi\u2019s electoral campaign, described as India\u2019s first \u201c<a href=\"http://nottspolitics.org/2014/05/21/modi-fying-india-a-presidential-campaign-and-the-challenge-of-parliamentary-governance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">presidential</a>\u201d campaign, was carried out along American lines with the focus as much on Modi as on his party. Lance Price, a former BBC journalist turned spin doctor for Tony Blair, was brought in to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/fc246402-c64e-11e4-9bf4-00144feab7de.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">write the story of the election</a>; Andy Marino, an unknown British writer, was given full access to Modi for an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Narendra-Modi-Political-Andy-Marino-ebook/dp/B00JJHGGAI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">atrociously written hagiography</a> that defended him on everything, <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/I-am-sad-about-Gujarat-riots-but-have-no-guilt-Narendra-Modi-in-biography/articleshow/32675740.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">including</a> the Gujarat massacres. The campaign also featured the direct imprint of the Indian-American diaspora, including a purportedly nonpartisan group called <a href=\"http://indiancag.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Citizens for Accountable Governance</a> (CAG). With members drawn from the alumni of Columbia and Brown, and former employees of JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, the CAG provided <a href=\"http://qz.com/220329/this-little-known-non-profit-was-the-secret-of-modi-campaigns-razor-sharp-execution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">data analysis</a> and slick marketing tools for the campaign, with <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/an-indian-politician-is-using-holographic-avatars-to-speak-to-more-voters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">holograms</a> of Modi beamed, like some kind of Sith lord, into distant Indian villages.</p><p>Yet beneath the modern, entrepreneurial campaign, there remained the minority baiting, the majoritarian aggressiveness, the riots, the intimidation, and the abuse. Among the crowds in India, Modi, having first softened them up with populist language that stood in direct contradiction to his business-friendly ethos in the boardrooms and conference centers of the West, poured out his usual sectarian invective, referring to himself as a <i>sevak\u2014</i>a religious devotee. In the eastern part of India, <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/modi-assam-muslims-immigrant-congress-idINKBN0DK0B020140504\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">just days after</a> more than 30 Muslims had been killed in riots targeting them for their supposed origins in neighboring Bangladesh, Modi, hands full of theatrical gestures, voice punctuated by dramatic pauses, spoke of how after the elections and his victory, Bangladeshis in India would have to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm44noronNs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pack up their bags and leave</a>. </p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-left\"><p>Modi\u2019s electoral campaign was carried out along American lines, with the focus on him as much as his party.</p></aside><p>It was done with expertise, with subtlety, and always with an awareness of the business-friendly image being promoted abroad.

Three months after he took over, riots broke out between Hindus and Muslims, the majority of the dead and the displaced being Muslims. Shah made sure, in a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-election-religion-idUSBREA3704J20140408\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">subsequent speech</a> in April 2014, to accuse Muslims of raping and killing Hindus and talked of the elections as an opportunity to teach a lesson to the perpetrators of evil. The Election Commission of India, which <a href=\"http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/faq/faq_mcc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">prohibits</a> appealing to voters on sectarian grounds, briefly <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/uk-india-election-shah-idINKBN0D402Y20140418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">banned</a> Shah from campaigning, but Modi\u2019s election drive proceeded without a hitch.</p><p>As Modi went about his business, <a href=\"http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-bombay-hc-allows-dropping-of-pm-modi-s-name-as-respondent-in-a-pil-2103694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wielding swords</a> at rallies and berating <a href=\"http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/letters/the-meaning-of-secularism-in-india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201csecularism,\u201d</a> the word used in India to emphasize its constitutional principle of equal rights for all religious beliefs, his devotees in India and the United States went about their mob business on the internet and in the media and social media.

Teenagers <a href=\"http://www.mid-day.com/articles/narendra-modi-tattoos-a-hit-among-gujarats-youngsters/235588\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tattooed images of Modi</a> on their bodies, and he was lauded as the country\u2019s most eligible bachelor. The fact that he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/04/10/why-did-narendra-modi-keep-his-wife-secret-for-almost-50-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">was in fact married</a>, to a woman with whom he had never lived, who has never been given financial support\u2014and who, after Modi became prime minister, would be <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-passport-for-narendra-modis-wife-as-she-has-no-marriage-certificate/article7855384.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">denied a passport</a> because she possessed no marriage certificate\u2014was largely forgotten, or drowned out with abuse and threats.<span> </span></p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>In <a href=\"http://www.india-seminar.com/2002/513/513%20ashis%20nandy.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">an essay</a> a few months after the Gujarat massacres, Ashis Nandy, a clinical psychologist and one of India\u2019s best-known public intellectuals, recalled how he had interviewed Modi in the early \u201990s, when he was \u201ca nobody, a small-time RSS <i>pracharak </i>trying to make it as a small-time BJP functionary.\u201d Nandy wrote, \u201cIt was a long, rambling interview, but it left me in no doubt that here was a classic, clinical case of a fascist. I never use the term \u2018fascist\u2019 as a term of abuse; to me it is a diagnostic category.\u201d Modi, Nandy wrote:</p><blockquote><p>met virtually all the criteria that psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, and psychologists had set up after years of empirical work on the authoritarian personality. He had the same mix of puritanical rigidity, narrowing of emotional life, massive use of the ego defense of projection, denial, and fear of his own passions combined with fantasies of violence\u2014all set within the matrix of clear paranoid and obsessive personality traits. I still remember the cool, measured tone in which he elaborated a theory of cosmic conspiracy against India that painted every Muslim as a suspected traitor and a potential terrorist. </p></blockquote><p>Nandy soon found himself the subject of <a href=\"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/93148/F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a criminal case</a> lodged by the Gujarat police. It accused him, of all things, of disturbing the harmonious relationship between religious communities. In a way, it proved Nandy\u2019s point about the authoritarian personality who attempts to silence all dissent while expressing no doubts at all about his own actions and beliefs. Vinod Jose, in a meticulously researched <a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned-narendra-modi-profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">profile published in 2012</a> in <i>Caravan</i> magazine (I am a contributing editor to <i>Caravan</i>), had noted how Modi made others apologize, turning criticism into entrepreneurial opportunity. In February 2003, two Indian industrialists, at an event with Modi, commented on the Gujarat violence; Modi engineered a written apology from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the trade association that had organized the event. \u201cWe, in the CII, are very sorry for the hurt and pain you have felt,\u201d the letter stated, adding that it regretted \u201cvery much the misunderstanding that has developed since the sixth of February, the day of our meeting in New Delhi.\u201d </p><p>For those who have not apologized, and who have continued to stand up to Modi, different measures have been applied: legal intimidation, government pressure, social abuse, scurrilous gossip, police cases, and mob violence. Setalvad, one of Modi\u2019s staunchest opponents, found her residence in Mumbai <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/world/asia/teesta-setalvad-modi-india.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">raided last July</a> by the Central Bureau of Investigation, a federal agency, even as the Gujarat government attempted to have her arrested for financial fraud. The Ford Foundation, which has funded some of the projects carried out by Setalvad\u2019s organization, <a href=\"https://philanthropy.com/article/Indian-Government-Seeks/229361\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">discovered itself</a> in the crosshairs of both the federal government and the state of Gujarat, the latter accusing the foundation, in a repeat of the charges against Nandy, of \u201cabetting communal disharmony.\u201d</p><p>With <a href=\"http://time.com/4104020/india-bihar-elections-bjp-narendra-modi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a defeat</a> in November\u2019s state elections for Bihar, in the eastern part of the country, Modi\u2019s new India has amped up its sectarian Hindu nationalism, unleashing an astonishing degree of violence against all those who might not subscribe to this worldview, training its rhetoric and weaponry against anyone who might be identified as \u201canti-national,\u201d which includes all those critical of Modi, the Hindu right, and Indian nationalism. In January 2015, immigration officials prevented a Greenpeace India staffer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/12/greenpeace-india-campaigner-prevented-from-travelling-to-the-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">from boarding a flight to London</a>, where she was scheduled to speak to British members of parliament about <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/mahan-story-%E2%80%94-it-takes-village-20140826\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the environmental risk of a proposed mine</a> in Madhya Pradesh, in central India, co-owned by a company listed on the London stock exchange. The government also identified Greenpeace India as working against the national interest, canceling its license to receive funds from outside India. Later that year, the writer Arundhati Roy was <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/arundhati-roy-gets-contempt-notice-from-bombay-high-court/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">issued a criminal contempt notice</a> by a Nagpur court, for <a href=\"http://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/professor-pow/294265\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">an article she published</a> in <i>Outlook</i> magazine about G.N. Saibaba, a disabled political dissident confined to a wheelchair, who had been awaiting trial for a year. Roy argued Saibaba should not be prevented from getting bail if Bajrangi and Kodnani, convicted for their role in the 2002 massacres, could, and if Amit Shah, once charged with ordering extrajudicial executions, functioned with impunity as president of the BJP \u201cand the right-hand man of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\u201d </p><p>Shortly afterward, Rohith Vemula, a 26-year-old Ph.D. student at the University of Hyderabad who was a Dalit, the most oppressed of India\u2019s castes, <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2016/01/rohith-vemula-dalit-scholar-hanged-protest-160131120758202.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">committed suicide</a>. Vemula had protested the BJP student wing\u2019s forcible disruption of the screening of a documentary on riots provoked by the BJP as part of Modi\u2019s prime ministerial campaign, and had been targeted by the Hindu right. Described as anti-national by two ministers in Modi\u2019s cabinet, and barred by authorities at the University of Hyderabad from entering its hostels and public spaces, a practice reminiscent of the ostracization of Dalits by upper-caste Hindus, he hanged himself.</p><p>In February, Kanhaiya Kumar, a student leader at Jawaharlal Nehru University, a public university in Delhi portrayed as an elite left bastion by the Hindu right, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/17/india-kanhaiya-kumar-watershed-freedom-intolerance-bjp-hindu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">arrested by the Delhi police </a>on the orders of a BJP minister <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35560518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">for sedition</a>. During two of Kumar\u2019s court appearances, lawyers (or men who claimed to be lawyers) <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/politics/kanhaiya-kumar-bail-plea-comes-up-today-goon-lawyers-caught-on-video-celebrating-patiala-house-assault-2638058.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">assaulted students and faculty </a>who had come to show their solidarity with Kumar. For good measure, they also beat up journalists who attempted to record the violence.</p><p>As in the 2002 massacres and their aftermath, the degree of violence under Modi\u2019s rule differs depending on the target. In the case of Mohammad Akhlaq, a Muslim man lynched in September on the suspicion of eating beef, it was a mob at the door <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34398433\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">with swords and pistols</a>. When a group of writers returned the national awards they had received in protest of the Modi government\u2019s sectarianism, a Bollywood actor <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/anupam-khers-march-for-india-today-against-intolerance-protests-1241047\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">led a march</a> against these writers for having \u201churt the spirit of India,\u201d ending with a much-publicized meeting with Modi. </p><p>Against this backdrop, with violence piling up almost faster than can be recorded, Modi has functioned as a talking mask. Despite his ubiquity on social media, with two Twitter feeds, one personal and one official, and despite being constantly photographed in expensive clothes\u2014he wore a reportedly <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Where-did-PMs-pinstripe-suit-fabric-come-from/articleshow/46049437.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$16,000 suit</a> made on Savile Row when meeting Obama in Delhi last January, a gift to him from a businessman, which was auctioned off later\u2014he is perhaps the most closed-off head of state India has seen. He rarely gives interviews to the media, and never to journalists who might be critical of him. But he is always making pronouncements, sometimes <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/indian-telecom-regulator-bans-facebooks-free-internet-for-the-poor/2016/02/08/561fc6a7-e87d-429d-ab62-7cdec43f60ae_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">providing free internet for rural India</a> with the assistance of Mark Zuckerberg, sometimes solving climate change for the world in a Twitter conversation with @potus, tweeting an endless stream of banalities.</p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed full-width\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/8a98bad8192d4397f26c80f5701c58548173e3c1.jpeg?w=800\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;9e39b7f7-3c7c-45ca-b85c-49a2ef7acc40&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;8a98bad8192d4397f26c80f5701c58548173e3c1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:3000,&quot;height&quot;:1952,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;JPEG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/8a98bad8192d4397f26c80f5701c58548173e3c1.jpeg&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"800\"><figcaption><span class=\"caption-text\">A makeshift barricade erected by Muslims in Gujarat to protect against Hindu attackers during the 2002 rioting.</span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Ami Vitale/Getty</span></figcaption></figure><p>His performance is a banal kind of greatness, calibrated finely over a decade, even as behind and around him violence moves in ranks that make it hard to tell the difference between the mob and the police. Yet the authoritarian personality of Modi would be without impact, without significance, if it did not resonate with the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/11/diasporas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">millions</a> of authoritarian personalities among the professionalized classes in India and the diaspora, in Silicon Valley, and New Jersey, and Mumbai, and Delhi, among those who have risen so suddenly as to be suffering from vertigo, who feel liberated from all meaningful knowledge, whether from the past or the present, and who feel enslaved by their liberation. While they harness their souls to the standards of professional, material, Westernized success, to the air conditioning that Modi mocks when on the campaign trail, their insecurity and humiliation about the West makes them extract sustenance from Modi\u2019s utterances about Hindus having invented plastic surgery. </p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\"><p>Modi engineered a vigilante-police state, one in which the righteous were punished and perpetrators rewarded.</p></aside><p>Modi cannot be held solely responsible for such rage and despair, even if he amplifies it. His supporters, at home and in the West, the West itself, which chooses to ignore the violence in India, and a complaisant liberal intelligentsia, concerned more with its career prospects than with standing up to Modi, have to share the responsibility. There is also much continuity between Modi\u2019s India and what preceded it, including the way in which the Congress stood aside during the 2002 massacres and their aftermath, selectively exploiting the culpability of Modi and his government but never genuinely interested in justice; nurturing Hindu majoritarianism under the guise of nationalism; promoting the enrichment of a select few.</p><p>From this hollowed-out form of success, bereft of love, spirituality, and justice, meaning can only emerge from banality and hatred. Modi\u2019s contradictions and lies channel the confusions of his supporters perfectly. In a manner reminiscent of the vanguards of China\u2019s Cultural Revolution or the nativists flocking to Donald Trump, they accuse the old elites of holding back the nation and the culture from true greatness. They attack those responsible for the ruined past, the uncertain future, and the endless present. They assail the \u201canti-nationals\u201d who stand in their way, beating and molesting people while shouting, \u201c<i><a href=\"http://thewire.in/2016/02/16/defending-bharat-mata-with-kicks-and-punches-21692/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bharat Mata Ki Jai.</a></i>\u201d They demand people say it to prove they are not traitors, emboldened by a meeting of the BJP in March, led by Modi, that declared a refusal to use the slogan as <a href=\"http://thewire.in/2016/03/22/experts-decry-bjp-for-getting-constitution-wrong-on-bharat-mata-issue-25516/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tantamount to disrespecting the Indian constitution</a>. They hammer, with swords and guns and smartphones and double-digit growth, at the doors of the beef-eaters, the environmentalists, the university students, the feminists, the Dalits, the leftists, the dissenting writers, the skeptics, the \u201canti-nationals\u201d\u2014anyone who will not declare, both fists clenched, \u201c<i>Bharat Mata Ki Jai!</i>\u201d They have a rage that must burn itself out, and all that stands between them and the ashes of their rage is the astonishing, amazing phenomenon of a world that can still produce, from the crushed bottom layers of Indian society, people who, with every bit of the dignity and courage they can muster, resist the lure of their silent, lonely, aloof, admired, and unloved leader. </p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133014/new-face-india-anti-gandhi</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133014</guid><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[June 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Narendra Modi]]></category><category><![CDATA[-homepage-bottom2]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Siddhartha Deb]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/3d526bf77dde7d77e0ecf013a7e82d30f82f34be.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Going With the Wind]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I have to thank Miss Rosa Hutchinson of the Macmillan Company for a series of press releases that is more impressive than any published review of the season\u2019s best seller:</p><blockquote><p>June 19\u2014<i>Gone with the Wind,</i> the forthcoming novel of the real South in the sixties and seventies, by Margaret Mitchell of Atlanta, is having a record-breaking advance sale. Already\u2014two weeks before publication\u2014this Macmillan novel has piled up the largest advance sale of any book of recent years. It is the choice of the Book of the Month Club for July.</p><p><span>Ellen Glasgow is enthusiastic about it. She writes: \u201cThe book is absorbing. It is a fearless portrayal, romantic yet not sentimental, of a lost tradition and a way of life. I hope it will be widely read and appreciated.\u201d </span></p><p>June 29\u2014A fifth large printing of Margaret Mitchell\u2019s first novel, <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, has been ordered, although the book is just out this week. The book may be out of stock at Macmillan\u2019s for a few days, but booksellers throughout the country will have copies available. </p><p>July 13\u2014A sixth printing of <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, by Margaret Mitchell, making a total of 140,000 to date, is being rushed through the press and will be ready this week, so that all current orders can be taken care of. </p><p>July 15\u2014Motion-picture rights in Margaret Mitchell\u2019s novel, <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, have been sold to Selznick International Pictures, Inc. The price is believed to be the highest ever given for a first novel. </p><p>July 20\u2014176,000 copies of Margaret Mitchell\u2019s novel, <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, have now been printed by Macmillan in an attempt to cope with the steady inrush of orders. The demand for the book certainly reflects credit on the taste of the American reading public, for <i>Gone with the Wind</i> has been likened by various prominent critics to the work of Thackeray, Galsworthy, Tolstoy, Undset, Hardy, Trollope, and Dickens\u2014and to <i>The Three Musketeers</i>. </p><p>July 23\u2014What is believed to be a record in recent years has been established by Margaret Mitchell\u2019s <i>Gone with the Wind</i>. Although it has been published only one month, printings already total 201,000 copies.</p><p><span>In the first three days of this week alone, Macmillan shipped out on booksellers\u2019 reorders 16,468 copies. </span></p><p>July 24.\u2014The Macmillan Company reports that orders booked yesterday for Margaret Mitchell\u2019s <i>Gone with the Wind</i> totaled 10,753. </p><p>Early in August\u2014<i>Gone with the Wind</i>, by Margaret Mitchell\u2014nationwide best seller in fiction lists \u2014has as one of its chief characters Melanie Wilkes. Miss Mitchell writes Macmillan\u2019s that many people seem to be troubled as to the correct pronunciation of Melanie, some giving it the accent on the second syllable and with a long \u201ca.\u201d The correct pronunciation puts the accent on the first syllable. </p><p><i>Gone with the Wind</i> is now going into its ninth printing, bringing the total number of copies to 236,000. </p><p>August 17\u2014The sales department of The Macmillan Company is mathematically minded. It has figured out some interesting facts about <i>Gone with </i><i>the Wind, </i>the best seller by Margaret Mitchell. It appears that if all the copies of <i>Gone with the Wind </i>that have been printed were piled on top of each other the stack would be 50 times as high as the Empire State Building in New York City.

Obviously Miss Mitchell\u2019s first novel meets the specialized demands of the book-buying public (as distinguished from the larger and less prosperous public that borrows its books from the library). It is written from the woman\u2019s point of view, and most book buyers are women. It flatters people who like to think of themselves as aristocrats, and this amiable weakness is more than usually common among the patrons of bookstores. Moreover, it is very long, and people who pay $3 for a novel like to think that they are getting their money\u2019s worth, are getting entertainment that will carry them through the idle moments of a whole fortnight. But beyond all this, an essential reason for its popularity lies in the big yet comfortably familiar theme that Miss Mitchell has chosen. </p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\"><i>Gone with the Wind</i> is an encyclopedia of the plantation legend.</aside><p><i>Gone with the Wind</i> is an encyclopedia of the plantation legend. Other novelists by the hundreds have helped to shape this legend, but each of them has presented only part of it. Miss Mitchell repeats it as a whole, with all its episodes and all its characters and all its stage settings\u2014the big white-columned house sleeping under its trees among the cotton fields; the band of faithful retainers, including two that quaintly resemble Aunt Jemima and Old Black Joe; the white-haired massa bathing in mint juleps; the heroine with her seventeen-inch waist and the high-spirited twins who come courting her in the magnolia-colored moonlight, with the darkies singing under the hill\u2014then the War between the States, sir, and the twins riding off on their fiery chargers, and the lovely ladies staying behind to nurse the wounded, and Sherman\u2019s march (now the damyankees are looting the mansion and one of them threatens to violate its high-bred mistress, but she clutches the rusty trigger of an old horse pistol and it goes off bang in his ugly face)\u2014then the black days of Reconstruction, the callousness of the Carpetbaggers, the scalawaggishness of the Scalawags, the knightliness of the Ku KIux Klansmen, who frighten Negroes away from the polls, thus making Georgia safe for democracy and virtuous womanhood and Our Gene Talmadge\u2014it is all here, every last bale of cotton and bushel of moonlight, every last full measure of Southern <span>female devotion working its lilywhite fingers uncomplainingly to the lilywhite bone.</span></p><p>But even though the legend is false in part and silly in part and vicious in its general effect on Southern life today, still it retains its appeal to fundamental emotions. Miss Mitchell lends new strength to the legend by telling it as if it had never been told before, and also by mixing a good share of realism with the romance. She writes with a splendid recklessness, blundering into big scenes that a more experienced novelist would hesitate to handle for fear of being compared unfavorably with Dickens or Dostoevsky. Miss Mitchell is afraid of no comparison and no emotion\u2014she makes us weep at a deathbed (and really weep), exult at a sudden rescue and grit our teeth at the crimes of our relatives the damyankees. I would never, never say that she has written a great novel, but in the midst of triteness and sentimentality her book has a simple-minded courage that suggests the great novelists of the past. No wonder it is going like the wind.</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133244/going-wind</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133244</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Books]]></category><category><![CDATA[Gone with the Wind]]></category><category><![CDATA[From the Archives]]></category><category><![CDATA[-homepage-suppress]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malcolm Cowley]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 15:41:32 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/90603488b6b361f20b93082239201ff8c35523e0.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[For Public Figures, Being Black and \u201cBeing Black\u201d Are Two Different Things]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This spring, over 2,000 Washington insiders, journalists, and Hollywood elite filtered into the ballroom of the Washington Hilton to attend the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association annual dinner.</p><aside id=\"signal-133240\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>The first comedian to perform for the group was Mark Russell <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-correspondents-dinner/story?id=38396958\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">in 1983</a>.

He also highlighted a type of tension that all African-Americans\u2014including President Obama\u2014can relate to: that being black and \u201cbeing black\u201d are two different things.</p><h2>Navigating tricky terrain</h2><p>Afterwards, Wilmore pounded his chest and pointed at the president.

Since ascending to the presidency, Obama has rarely been seen connecting with his black constituents this way. After all, as president, he\u2019s supposed to represent all of America. Regrettably, that has tended to mean defaulting to the white majority.</p><h2>Being president while black</h2><p>Every now and then, however, we\u2019ll see President Obama being black.

But Boehner\u2019s remarks have a wider significance than being just another example of how Cruz manages to tick off virtually every human being he comes into contact with. In Boehner\u2019s words we see the fatal flaw of Cruz\u2019s last-ditch strategy to wrest the Republican presidential nomination away from the presumptive winner, Donald Trump\u2014and the fatal calculation that the GOP establishment has made in deciding to live with Trump. </p><aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\" id=\"signal-133218\"></aside><p>Cruz\u2019s end-game plan, which could come <a href=\"/minutes/133235/today-day-ted-cruz-calls-quits\">crashing down</a> in today\u2019s Indiana primary, was based on an awareness that elite Republicans like Boehner hate him, but also on a faith that they would conclude he\u2019s the lesser evil. The powers-that-be would hold their noses, endorse him, and then rally behind him in a contested convention in Cleveland. In effect, Cruz has been gambling that the #NeverTrump sentiment expressed on Twitter would coalesce behind him in real life. But it\u2019s now clear that #NeverTrump is a hollow slogan. For better or worse, the bulk of<b> </b>Republican Party leaders have indicated that they won\u2019t risk a backlash from Trump supporters, who make up a large plurality of primary voters, by joining Cruz\u2019s ranks. </p><p>Cruz has six senators endorsing him. That\u2019s better than John Kasich\u2019s two endorsements and Trump\u2019s one. But the simple fact is that more than 80 percent of the 54 sitting Republican senators have so far decided not to endorse anyone. This doesn\u2019t matter to Trump, who is doing fine without endorsements, but it is lethal to Cruz\u2019s bid to be the standard-bearer of anti-Trumpism.</p><p>In the same on-stage interview in which Boehner compared Cruz to Satan, he also said he was \u201ctexting buddies\u201d with Trump. The flip-side of Cruz\u2019s personal unpopularity is Trump\u2019s relative friendliness with power brokers, and not just in the Republican Party. If Cruz is seen as an inflexible ideologue, Trump is regarded among the powerful as flexible and pragmatic.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\"><p>To use the language of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Trump is Chaotic Evil and Cruz is Lawful Evil.</p></aside><p>Trump has hobnobbed with politicians of both major parties for decades, of course, and it\u2019s not uncommon for them to say, as Howard Dean did on the <i>New Republic</i>\u2019s <a href=\"/article/132638/primary-concerns-episode-9-divide-flounder\">Primary Concerns podcast</a>, that Trump\u2019s inflammatory political rhetoric is just an act. \u201cI actually think Trump is somewhat of a moderate,\u201d Dean said. \u201cIf I had to choose between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, and my choices were limited, I\u2019d vote for Donald Trump.\u201d What\u2019s true for Dean as a Democrat appears to be true for many Republicans like Boehner\u2014enough so that Cruz won\u2019t get the last-minute rally of support he needs. </p><p>Further, Republicans unhappy with the two frontrunners might console themselves with the thought that Trump is likely a passing evil, whereas Cruz could prove a more lasting one. Trump has a personality cult that might disintegrate if he loses in the general; Cruz is the leader of a GOP faction that will continue to try and grapple for power. Cruz as nominee would be in a position to put his stamp on the party so that it is much more aligned with his far-right views. Trump shows little interest in having such a legacy.</p><p>The Republican elites\u2019 view of Trump as the lesser evil rests, then, on a real calculation\u2014and it\u2019s clearly affecting the race. Cruz is likely to lose tonight in Indiana, which will set the stage for Trump to get the 1,237 delegates needed to forestall a contested election. Still, the fact that Republican leaders are willing to accept Trump as doing less damage doesn\u2019t mean their judgment is right.</p><p>In truth, Trump and Cruz shouldn\u2019t be talked about as lesser or greater evils, but as different types of evil. To use the language of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Trump is Chaotic Evil and Cruz is Lawful Evil. (Jeb Bush\u2019s comment that Trump is the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-bush-donald-trump_us_5670c651e4b0dfd4bcbfdff8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chaos candidate</a>\u201d rings true). Cruz is the Grand Inquisitor, whose goal is to inflict the law without mercy. Trump is the Joker, someone who flouts the law with merry impunity. </p><p>For a political party, a \u201cchaos candidate\u201d is surely more dangerous than a lawful Lucifer. Cruz is an extreme-right version of a typical Republican politician, but he maintains the party\u2019s tradition going back to Goldwater of coding his appeals to bigotry in dog-whistle language. Trump\u2019s whole modus operandi is to flout conventional \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d by not using code. He turns subtext into text, and makes the latent blatant. And that has made Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/21/the-last-presidential-candidate-who-was-as-unpopular-as-donald-trump-david-duke/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the most unpopular presidential aspirant</a> since the 1920s. </p><p>If he becomes the party nominee, Trump is likely to drag the GOP down with him\u2014partly because <span>Republican candidates won\u2019t even be able to make a plausible case that they don\u2019t belong to the party of racism and misogyny. </span><span>While powerful white men like Boehner might find Trump personally charming, most of the country disagrees.</span></p><p>By deciding that it\u2019s not worth fighting Trump just to end up with Cruz, elite Republicans are making a grievous error. Cruz might be \u201cLucifer in the flesh,\u201d but Trump promises to be something worse. After all, Lucifer at least had some charm and guile, while in Trump\u2019s version, chaotic evil comes across to most people as pure ugliness. </p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133218/case-lucifer</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133218</guid><category><![CDATA[Election 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ted Cruz]]></category><category><![CDATA[Republican Primary 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Republican Party]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter-top]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jeet Heer]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 14:00:13 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/27fbe883c349ef4d9a1668e02e1227f8e6ffd670.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Myth of the Limousine Liberal]]></title><description><![CDATA[<aside id=\"signal-133013\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p><span>Since the\nlate nineteenth century, the United States has been blessed with two major\nreligious ethics. Protestantism valued rapid economic growth and Social\nDarwinist individualism but, after all the money had been made, also left us\nwith disinterested public service and generous philanthropy.

The clash between these two ways of looking at\nthe world explains much of modern American political experience. Catholics\njoined unions, supported public displays of religion, voted for urban political\nmachines, defended their ethnic heritage, and sent their children to parochial\nschools.

Lindsay is\nremembered for his riot-quelling walk through Harlem.

American history is filled with\nthe language of right-wing populists poking fun at or stirring resentment\ntoward upper-class liberals: The rich were, depending on the demagogue,\ndiplomats in striped pants (Joe McCarthy); drinkers of \u201cmartinis with their\nlittle fingers up in the air\u201d (George Wallace); a new professional class\n(Trotskyite-influenced neo-conservatives); and, surely the all-time champion,\n\u201cthe Harvard and Yale boys sent to teach our pigs birth control\u201d (North Dakota\npopulist William Lemke). But \u201climousine liberal\u201d has one big advantage over its\ncompetitors. Hypocrisy is the charge the right loves to make against the left. \u201cLimousine\nliberalism\u201d distilled the charge into a two-word slogan: These were the folks\nwho insisted on private schools for their children and public schools for\neveryone else\u2019s, or\u2014think of Al Gore\u2014who lived in vast, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/GlobalWarming/story?id=2906888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">energy-guzzling\nmansions</a> while proclaiming the evils of global warming.&nbsp; </p><p>Fraser\nprovides a brisk and entertaining history of limousine liberalism in all its\nlinguistic manifestations, and his book is worth reading for that alone.\nIndeed, his analysis, if anything, is <i>too</i> prescient: Although Fraser was\nable to include a few words about Donald Trump in his introduction and at the\nend, we can be certain that the Developer of All Developers will rely on his\nquite vivid imagination to add <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">new terms to the vocabulary of right-wing\npopulism</a> as he continues his campaign for president. The question of how\ncertain rich and powerful people escape responsibility for their conduct by\nshifting the blame for whatever goes wrong to an odd alliance between those\nwith considerable social status and those with close to none is endlessly\nfascinating.

Ought we, on the other hand, to admire those who lead the attack\non the privileged because of their populism or chastise them for their racism?\nFraser finds these questions difficult to answer, at least unambiguously.

Fraser therefore sees much that is\npositive among the Archie Bunkers in the land. \u201cFor insular working-class\nworlds under duress, where ethnic and neighborhood ties still held, where the\nchurch, the union hall, and the tavern still anchored everyday life but felt\nthemselves under siege, this put-down of their putative superiors was welcome\nrecompense. It functioned as a kind of stylized gesture of resistance, and in\nthat way was not so very different from the performance of symbolic politics by\nidentity groups on the left.\u201d Whatever else you might say about these\nreactionaries, Fraser insists, they were never comfortable with the\ncountry-club elite. The same could not be said about the New Leftist students,\nrebels against their prosperous parents but strikingly like them in their\ncondescension and disdain\u2014and soon about to take up their golf memberships. </p><p>Indeed,\nFraser sounds remarkably like the neo-conservatives, with all their\nfulminations about the evils of the new class, when he writes about New Left\nactivists. \u201cThey didn\u2019t summer in the Hamptons or make truly strategic\ndecisions for corporate America,\u201d as he puts it, but they did possess \u201ca\nmeritocratic worldview and a dismissive repugnance for all those inhibitions\nand vestigial institutions standing in the way of individual self-empowerment\nand self-gratification and self-realization.\u201d No wonder inner-city ethnic\nminorities look to the authorities to restore law and order. They understand\nthat left-wing radicals are the enemies of everything they cherish. In Fraser\u2019s\nworld, <a href=\"/article/63477/mrs-america\">Phyllis Schlafly comes in for measured praise</a>, but not those supporting\nthe Equal Rights Amendment. The latter \u201cwere simultaneously zealots for state\nintervention and extreme individualists who had no room in their lives for that\nintermediate zone of life where family and Holy Scripture prescribed social\ndiscipline and duty.\u201d That, in case you were wondering, is Fraser talking, not\nSchlafly.</p><p>When\nChristopher Lasch <a href=\"/article/74550/jeremiah-american-style-0\">expressed sentiments such as these</a> in the 1970s, I viewed\nthem as necessary tonics for a left that had indeed lost touch with real\npeople. Reading Fraser\u2019s restatement of the same critique a few decades later,\nit all sounds rather trite. For one thing, the rich in recent years have reverted\nto simply being rich: From my observations and indeed, at one point, Fraser\u2019s\nas well, there are far more conservatives being driven around in limos these\ndays than liberals. George Soros, the <a href=\"https://philanthropy.com/article/No-48-George-Soros/153641\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">financier of so many liberal causes</a>, is\nno longer typical of Manhattan wealth; far more representative is the\nhedge-fund manager Paul Singer, who supports gay rights but is otherwise\nRepublican from top to toe. At a time when income inequality has reached\nscandalous levels, rarer are the privileged with a social conscience. They are\nmaking too much money to give any away, at least while they are alive enough to\ntend to their art collections.</p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\">Whatever damage limousine liberalism may have done, Uber\nconservatism is far more dangerous.</aside><p>Even more\nnoticeably, the silent majority is now quite loud and the forgotten American\nprofiled weekly. Fraser makes extensive use of \u201clittle man,\u201d the term\npopularized by the <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Fallada\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">German novelist Hans Fallada</a> just as Hitler was coming to\npower. The first American little men attracted to right-wing populists such as\nFather Coughlin and Huey Long can perhaps be forgiven: Reactionary attacks on\nclass privilege at that time were relatively new and untested. But blaming the\ncondition of the downtrodden on those far below them has lost its freshness.\nTrump voters wail about their marginalization yet routinely obtain more from\nthe political process than nearly all of the groups seeking favor from\nWashington; we will know when the influence of the white working class has\nwaned at precisely the point when gun control legislation passes Congress.\nThese are Americans who no longer require a fig leaf. They blame minorities and\nimmigrants for their anger and are proud of it. Not for them the political\ncorrectness that, outside their fervid minds, is actually a demonstration of\nrespect for others. Whatever damage limousine liberalism may have done, Uber\nconservatism is far more dangerous.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Fraser\nwrites, with Marx lingering in mind, as if working-class voters, despite their\nlow horizons, will someday see the truth and recognize what oppresses them. But\nmaybe Trump supporters already feel they know the truth and, in choosing Trump,\nhave chosen the man who most closely thinks like they do. There is no credible\nway to explain away or justify white male support for Donald Trump. Call his\nenthusiasts <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/272497-cruz-trump-supporters-are-low-information-voters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">low-information voters</a>, if you wish, or find reasons for their\nanger in corporate downsizing, but the truth is that these people are, like the\npolitician who attracts them, motivated by bigotry. A century-long history of\ndemonizing limousine liberals, by whatever name they are called, suggests that\ncertain Americans are likely to support the demagogue every time; if they\nsometimes take positions similar to those on the left, such as opposition to\nfree trade, it is only when their bigotry conveniently lines up alongside their\nprogressivism. </p><p>Nor should\nit appear somehow odd that people of privilege support liberalism even if\nliberal legislation would tax them heavily or reduce their overall wealth.\nLiberalism, not conservatism, is the default political ideology of those whose\nancestors made fortunes decades ago; tolerance and empathy require historical\nmemory and appreciation to germinate. If Ted Cruz is right that \u201cthe Fortune\n500 is running shamelessly to endorse the radical gay marriage agenda over\nreligious liberty,\u201d then good for the Fortune 500. I would take them over the\nrelentlessly middle-class members of the North Carolina legislature, which\nseems excessively preoccupied with restroom usage, any day. The accusation that\nlimousine liberals look down their noses at ordinary Americans pales before the\nfact that right-wing conservatives want to rub so many noses in the dirt. </p><p>Steve\nFraser, like many on the left, tends to attack the rich and sympathize with the\npoor almost reflexively. Although I share those sentiments, I question whether\nthe best way to create a more egalitarian society is for the left to continue\nto lodge its hopes with the less well-off, only to be disappointed when they do\nnot act as leftists expect them to do. (The most current example is the failure\nof <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/why-black-voters-dont-feel-the-bern-213707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">African American and Hispanic voters to support in greater numbers the more\nleft-wing candidate, Bernie Sanders</a>, in the 2016 Democratic primaries.) It\nseems to me that when one party in a two-party system is under the sway of the\nfanatical and the fantasists, the other party should seek as broad a coalition\nas possible. That will not happen when writers like Steve Fraser call wealthy\ndo-gooders \u201cinsufferably smug and holier than thou\u201d or \u201cspoiled narcissists,\u201d\nlet alone a whole m\u00e9lange of similar epithets. I like my liberals where I can find\nthem, and if some of them, although increasingly fewer, are found in limos, I\ncan live with that.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133013/myth-limousine-liberal</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133013</guid><category><![CDATA[Books]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[June 2016]]></category><category><![CDATA[Review]]></category><category><![CDATA[Liberalism]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><category><![CDATA[-homepage-lower]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alan Wolfe]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/741ea3f80717b8d137468a7254f6385f1b7eb72a.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bots Will Tear Us Apart]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><span>Bots are the new apps. Or at least that was </span><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-microsoft-future-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the message</a><span> from tech giant Microsoft, at their recent developer conference in San Francisco. There, the company suggested that bots, automated bits of software that can understand queries and instructions phrased in everyday language\u2014everything from ordering a pizza to analyzing a database for sales trends\u2014are the next frontier in computing. To that end, Microsoft also announced a toolkit to allow others to build their own bots, simplifying the sophisticated computing necessary to, say, have a customer service issue resolved by an automated bot rather than a person. According to company CEO Satya Nadella, bots may represent as big a technical leap as graphical user interfaces or apps on smartphones.</span><br></p><aside id=\"signal-133220\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>Whether that\u2019s true remains to be seen. Facebook, however, is <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/19/all-your-bots-are-belong-to-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">throwing its considerable weight</a> behind bots in Messenger; 20 million people in China are <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/33/attraction/your-next-new-best-friend-might-be-a-robot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">already chatting with</a> Xiaoice, a bot developed by Microsoft. (On Weibo, the popular Chinese micro-blogging service, it\u2019s currently ranked the service\u2019s most influential user.) Slack is <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/12/slack-is-investing-80-million-in-slack-bot-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">investing $80 million</a> into bots for its own popular chat app, while everyone from startup studio <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/11/betaworks-botcamp-wants-to-give-10-chatbot-startups-100k/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Betaworks</a> to former Engadget editor-in-chief Ryan Block is involved in creating or funding bot startups. It\u2019s clear that we\u2019re about to hear a lot about them. </p><p>Bots promise convenience. They\u2019ll be found in chat apps, where we\u2019ll talk to them as we do with our friends, and they\u2019ll be there when we need help, like a modern <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clippy</a>\u2014but for everything. They\u2019ll be more sophisticated, though, and far more useful. Today we expect a lot more from our digital assistants: not just rote answers, but intelligent responses\u2014though at the moment the <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/12/11416472/facebook-messenger-ai-bots-slow-f8-conference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">actual efficacy</a> of bots seems to be middling at best. </p><p>Our desire for them to get better, however, remains. Bots are supposed to make things like scheduling appointments or booking flights as simple as asking the question. We want them to be Siri on steroids, to make everyday tasks automatic. The ultimate aim, though\u2014at least according to Microsoft\u2019s Nadella\u2014is to produce a kind of \u201cambient intelligence.\u201d Think less a series of automated tools, and more like a smart, constantly available assistant. We want to ask our bots, \u201cWhat is good around here?\u201d or, \u201cHow should I organize my day?\u201d and get useful answers. Imagine being able to ask your Netflix bot to \u201cshow me a sad movie I would like\u201d or request Amazon\u2019s Alexa to \u201cplay the perfect song for a sunny morning.\u201d </p><p>More than anything, bots promise us a release from the contemporary tyranny of choice. While many would of course cringe at the idea of outsourcing taste to an algorithm\u2014not to mention the worries about privacy, or the way algorithms can <a href=\"http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-algorithm-and-the-watchtower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">enforce their own authority on the world</a>\u2014the allure is nonetheless clear: In a world of infinite choice, our bots could free us from freedom.</p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>The digital age is designed to maximize options: The technology that powers bots comes from the same impulse as the tech that makes it easy to read hundreds of news stories, have access to millions of songs and thousands of movies, and endless information and entertainment. What makes bots practical at this juncture in history is also what makes them compelling: they can wade through the muck that we don\u2019t have the energy or time for. Siri, it\u2019s all too much! Just tell me what do. Technology has filled modern life with more data than any one human can possibly manage or understand, and bots are ideal filters. </p><p>Right now, the best example of how bots might work is the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/video/quartzs-new-app-delivers-news-via-chat/519493890/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quartz news app</a>\u2014which, both fittingly and funnily, is not a bot at all. Human editors write and curate the information. Instead of delivering the day\u2019s stories on a web page, the app chats with you. The experience is like messaging an informative, know-it-all friend. That might sound odd, but it\u2019s surprisingly compelling, in no small part because of the friendly, approachable way it the app commands your attention. </p><p>The Quartz app\u2014and the bots that inspire it\u2014works because someone else takes the wheel. (Perhaps we\u2019re too drunk on data to drive?) Writing about <a href=\"http://blog.art21.org/2015/09/08/godflesh/#.VxkvcDArKUl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tinder</a>, New Inquiry editor Rob Horning said that the dating app \u201cautomates the process of finding someone but not what [to] do with them afterward.\u201d The thought is applicable to situations outside of dating: While bots can automate life, you still have to live it. </p><p>Perhaps that\u2019s why I find the <a href=\"http://nicole.pizza/true-love-tinder-robot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">True Love Tinder Robot</a> so appealing. The \u201crobot\u201d is in fact a few sheets of metal you touch that measures your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodermal_activity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">galvanic skin response</a>\u2014basically the change in how electrically conductive your skin is\u2014and a robotic hand, controlled by an Arduino board, that swipes left or right on Tinder accordingly. (Its creator, New York University graduate student Nicole He, <a href=\"http://nicole.pizza/true-love-tinder-robot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote</a> that she created the robot to consider what happens when we combine algorithms and biometric devices.)</p><p>That robot literally makes swiping automatic\u2014or perhaps autonomic. In the face of an endless-seeming sea of possibility, the Tinder bot perhaps explains what we want from bots, in general, as well: ceding our ability to choose because we have too much choice. </p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133220/bots-will-tear-us-apart</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133220</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Navneet Alang]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/b5daeaa7448a414d25aa5c054437cfd3c316065f.jpeg\"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[<i>Captain America</i>: Too Much Is More Than Enough]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is so lumbering and massive and unwieldy that it really is sort of a miracle that any of the movies work at all. And yet most of them do. (The best: The original <i>Avengers. </i>The worst: <i>Iron Man 2.</i>) This has been for two primary reasons. The first is that the franchise\u2019s template was laid down by two terrific four-quadrant filmmakers, Joss Whedon and Jon Favreau, men blessed with the seemingly impossible ability to package escapist, familiar entertainment as something distinctive, even original, while still pleasing their corporate masters. Their sensibilities are a through line\u2014filtered, distilled, but undeniably present\u2014from one movie to the next, connecting disparate characters and filmmakers with radically different sensibilities. (The only thing Kenneth Branagh and James Gunn have in common is that they both breathe air, but they fit snugly together in the MCU.)</p><aside id=\"signal-133229\" class=\"signal pull-right hide\"></aside><p>The second reason for the films\u2019 success is that the corporation in charge has a deep, emotional connection to all the characters because, well, it created them. This is not some dude in a suit and loafers in a Culver City studio coming up with a comic book movie because that\u2019s what the kids are into these days; the people who make this stuff take it as seriously, if not more seriously, than the people they\u2019re making it for. They\u2019re always going to do right by these characters, because it means doing right by themselves.</p><p>The inherent danger, of course, is that those who love these characters and this universe will never know how much is too much\u2014which brings us to <i>Captain America: Civil War, </i>a film that is entertaining and well-paced and meticulously constructed, and still made me wish I had an index with me so I could remind myself what was going on and who, exactly, all these people were. I have no horse in this comic book world: I just want an entertaining movie that uses the basic tools of filmmaking to guide me through what\u2019s happening. When done well, you have <i>The Avengers</i>, which was a joyous exploration of just how much giddy fun you could have with these iconic characters, Whedon playing with his figurines in the backyard and inviting you along. When done poorly, as in that <i>other </i>superhero vs. superhero epic of 2016, casual observers are left on the outside looking in, wondering why everyone is so angry with one another and why it\u2019s all so goddamned loud. <i>Civil War</i>\u2014which, for all intents and purposes, is <i>Avengers 3</i>\u2014is definitely on the upper tilt of that comic book curve, with a clear storyline and understandable character motivations, and action scenes that always have a little more thought put into them than might have been absolutely necessary. And yet you\u2019ll still end up with your head spinning by the end of the movie. <i>Captain America: Civil War</i><span> has a </span><i>lot </i><span>of plates in the air.</span></p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\">This is capitalist filmmaking, but they\u2019re populist capitalists. They send you home happy.</aside><p> This is a film with so many characters that Don Cheadle is essentially the seventeenth credited actor, but it all starts with Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the anchors of the MCU. In the wake of all the destruction caused by the first two <i>Avengers </i>movies, the United Nations asks the Avengers to sign a document saying they will not act without global approval; Iron Man wants to sign it, and Cap doesn\u2019t. There are a million subplots, but that\u2019s the basic conflict, as gaggles of superheroes (minus The Hulk and Thor, who are conveniently out of town like your Canadian high school girlfriend) line up on one side or another, leading to an inevitable and legitimately awesome set piece in which all the heroes fight each other in an airplane hangar. It\u2019s the geek-pleasing \u201c<i>weeeeeee!!!!!</i>\u201d sequence that\u2019s a blast start to finish, even if you don\u2019t know or care that much about any of the ancillary characters, if only because the filmmakers\u2019 enthusiasm is so infectious. You pay your money to see Ant-Man and Black Panther do battle, and the movie serves it to you in style. <i>Civil War</i> gives you what you want it to, another staple of the MCU: This is capitalist filmmaking, but they\u2019re populist capitalists. They send you home happy.</p><p>Directors Joe and Anthony Russo, who made the last <i>Captain America </i>movie and will be helming the upcoming <i>Infinity War </i>movies, are extremely organized filmmakers, and with a movie this crowded, they have to be. They juggle everything well, from building up to that big fight scene, to keeping Captain America and Iron Man on opposite sides, to providing viable human villains in a world constantly being invaded by all-powerful aliens to, most impressive, introducing more characters who will end up with their own standalone movies. The two big new faces here are Black Panther, played by a typically terrific Chadwick Boseman, and Spider-Man, saved from Sony\u2019s chronic mishandling of what was once the biggest superhero franchise of them all and portrayed by 19-year-old Tom Holland as the dorky, motor-mouthed teenager he was probably meant to be all along. They\u2019re both strong additions, but you\u2019ll still find yourself a bit exhausted by their presence: There is enough overstuffed story going on without them, let alone Ant-Man and Black Widow and Hawkeye and Vision and War Machine and all the rest.<span> </span></p><p><i>Civil War</i> can\u2019t stand up to the two <i>Avengers </i>movies or even the last <i>Captain America </i>movie: There\u2019s too much going on, too much world building, to have the <i>Avengers</i>\u2019 sense of loopy discovery or the tight focus of the last <i>Captain </i>movie. The movie is nearly three hours long and still feels truncated, like a ton of stuff was cut out. (Editing these movies must be a nightmare.) It doesn\u2019t help that the Winter Soldier himself, who is a major driving force of the plot in this film (even more than in the film that bore his name), is a bit of a dull pickle; Captain America and Iron Man are essentially fighting over him, which makes it a bit of a problem that he\u2019s barely in the top 20 of interesting super-powered beings in this movie. Marvel generally has trouble with villains too, and it\u2019s difficult to be invested here in a human bad guy when we\u2019ve been fighting off monster lizard aliens and robots bent on destroying the planet for the last few movies now. </p><p><i>Civil War</i> is both a <i>Captain America </i>sequel <i>and </i>a third <i>Avengers </i>movie, and that\u2019s more than any movie could possibly pull off. Still: There are smart people in charge of these movies, people who care about the characters and want to do right by the audience. That\u2019s not nothing. After requiring about a month after seeing <i>Batman v. Superman </i>for my brain to stop rattling around my head and the fillings in my teeth to stop bleeding\u2014for me to have faith in the human condition again\u2014I\u2019d say that\u2019s quite a bit indeed.</p><p><b>Grade: B</b></p>]]></description><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/133229/captain-america-much-enough</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">133229</guid><category><![CDATA[Film]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Grierson & Leitch]]></category><category><![CDATA[Marvel]]></category><category><![CDATA[Captain America]]></category><category><![CDATA[-newsletter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Will Leitch]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/20fce807f80fffab4eafdff48f2cb616e1064321.jpeg\"/></item></channel></rss>",
