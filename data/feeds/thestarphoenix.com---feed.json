For the most part, boxed white is best drunk with a shot of gin, a squeeze of lime, and maybe some muddled cilantro or mint. You may like it cut with soda water and lime, and skip the gin et al. (I also recommend a couple of drops of Absinthe. Grapefruit bitters work, too.)</p>\n<p>The only boxes I can recommend \u2014 and may, on rare occasion drink \u2014&nbsp;are those holding Sauvignon Blanc. At the moment Sauvignon Blanc is too valuable to go into a box, generally speaking. I\u2019ve been hoping to find a German or Canadian Riesling in a box as it currently is undervalued, but no luck so far. The strange blends in most \u201cdry white\u201d boxes smell musty, taste sweet and have about the same acidity you can find in a glass of water.</p>\n<p>So the only&nbsp;two whites I recommend are Copper Moon Sauvignon Blanc and Jackson-Triggs Sauvignon Blanc. They are quite similar wines. Copper Moon is paler. The bouquet of the J-T is a bit mustier \u2014&nbsp;that clears off quickly \u2014&nbsp;and I think Jackson-Triggs is a bit sweeter.</p>\n<p>For whatever reason I usually default to the Copper Moon. If you were to tell me you preferred the Jackson-Triggs, I wouldn\u2019t argue.</p>\n<p>If you are one of those people who takes off for the weekend in the summer and doesn\u2019t want to complicate packing, consider boxed wines this year. Were it my cottage, I\u2019d stick a box of one of these in the fridge for myself and whoever dropped in.</p>\n<p><strong>Copper Moon Sauvignon Blanc $40 ***</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jackson-Trigg Sauvignon Blanc $40 ***</strong></p>\n<p>Next week I think I have to review something in a bottle or I\u2019ll burst into tears.

Gardipy was there with some family members, visiting a man who was renting another room in the home, Crown prosecutor Bryce Pashovitz outlined in Saskatoon Court of Queen&#8217;s Bench.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_137906\" style=\"width: 258px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/craig-allen-mintuck-org-xmit-8ujmqvlkvsdfgrlrkv3e1.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-137906\" src=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/craig-allen-mintuck-org-xmit-8ujmqvlkvsdfgrlrkv3e1.jpeg?w=248&#038;h=300\" alt=\"Craig Allen Mintuck\" width=\"248\" height=\"300\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Craig Allen Mintuck</p></div>\n<p>Gardipy, 32, had been drinking that day with his sister and a cousin. During what seemed like a friendly visit in the kitchen, drinking some coolers, Mintuck suddenly stabbed Gardipy once in the abdomen in a motion that Gardipy&#8217;s sister didn&#8217;t even realize was violent, until she saw the blood on Gardipy&#8217;s white T-shirt.</p>\n<p>The eight-inch knife blade sliced into Gardipy&#8217;s aorta; he died of blood loss.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The burning question, one that will probably never be answered, is why?&#8221; Gardipy&#8217;s mother Sandra Neapetung said in court, addressing Mintuck.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What could my son have said to you to warrant such a senseless, brutal attack? &#8230; Why stab a stranger, an acquaintance, when there was no altercation? Life is so precious, and it can be gone in a split second and survivors of violence are forever changed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mintuck&#8217;s lawyer, George Combe, said he didn&#8217;t have an answer for the family.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All I can indicate to you is that my client, Mr. Mintuck, due to a state of drunkenness, has actually no memory or any consistent memory of what transpired,&#8221; Combe said in court. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s important to families to try and get some kind of closure, but I cannot provide the answer to you because there is no answer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mintuck was too nervous to address the family directly, Combe said, but wrote a letter that Combe read on his behalf.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The remorse that I feel knowing that I took someone special away from you is one of the most devastating feelings I have ever come to know,&#8221; Mintuck wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 36-year-old&#8217;s criminal record is so long and full of violent convictions his lawyer described it as &#8220;atrocious.&#8221; After his arrest in connection with Gardipy&#8217;s death, however, Mintuck disclosed for the first time his own history as a&nbsp;victim of&nbsp;abuse when he was a child and began getting counselling while on remand, Combe said.</p>\n<p>Mintuck turned to alcohol and drugs as a result of his experiences, and when he&#8217;s intoxicated, he becomes a different person, Combe told court.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is not an excuse for his behaviour.&nbsp;It&#8217;s just putting his life in context.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mintuck was charged with second-degree murder in Gardipy&#8217;s death, but following a preliminary hearing and discussions between lawyers, the Crown agreed to accept a plea to manslaughter. The Crown and defence jointly recommended a sentence of 15 years, with no eligibility for parole until Mintuck has served half of his sentence (offenders are generally eligible for parole after serving one-third of their sentence).</p>\n<p>Justice Gerald Allbright accepted the joint submission, noting it was &#8220;very much&#8221; at the high end of the range for manslaughter sentences in Saskatchewan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:hspray@postmedia.com\">hspray@postmedia.com</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thestarphoenix.com&#038;blog=98658785&#038;post=137752&#038;subd=postmediathestarphoenix2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thestarphoenix.com/news/crime/caswell-hill-stabbing-nets-man-15-year-sentence/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/albert-gardipy-died-of-a-single-stab-wound-to-his-abdomen-on.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2016/05/albert-gardipy-died-of-a-single-stab-wound-to-his-abdomen-on.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">051216-GARDIPY,_Albert.jpg-227570358-GARDIPY-_Albert-W.jpg</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4e837ac78906c9253a8d740d75e2f26f?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">hspraysp</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://postmediathestarphoenix2.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/craig-allen-mintuck-org-xmit-8ujmqvlkvsdfgrlrkv3e1.jpeg?w=248\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Craig Allen Mintuck</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Idylwyld Dr. overpass rehab starts Sunday</title>\n\t\t<link>http://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/idylwyld-dr-overpass-rehab-starts-sunday</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/idylwyld-dr-overpass-rehab-starts-sunday#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 23:52:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[thestarphoenix]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Local News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://thestarphoenix.com/?p=138027</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Major work on&#160;the Idylwyld Drive overpass at Ruth Street is set to start Sunday and while two-way traffic will be allowed, there will be restrictions in the area.

Speed and lane restrictions will be in place throughout the summer.</p>\n<p>Here are&nbsp;the city&#8217;s instructions for zipper merging:</p>\n<p>\u201cTo zipper merge correctly, as you see the &#8216;lane closed ahead&#8217; sign and traffic backing up, stay in your current lane up to the point of merge. Then take turns with other drivers to safely and smoothly ease into the remaining lane. Vehicles in the merging lane must signal, and drivers in the through lane must let one vehicle merge. This makes the traffic flow more quickly and efficiently for drivers in both lanes.\u201d</p>\n<p>The work will include stripping the surface asphalt, replacing the concrete deck and other miscellaneous repairs, according to the city.
