Over the last 20 years, the company has expanded to include five stores, accommodating Sydney and the surrounding area, and transporting their products from farms in Darwin and Lockyer Valley. Since the expansion, however, management has been a solo operation for Nguyen, as his partners sold their shares to him following SEAP\u2019s growth within the industry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The company provides plenty of exotic produce varieties that are locally grown, but they also import their product from several parts of Asia \u2013 both outlets maintain quality control standards, and the product is sorted to ensure that customers receive the best condition possible. Among SEAP\u2019s fruit products are longan, lychee, mango and mangosteen, fresh young coconut, Nashi pear, guava, persimmon, papaya, dragonfruit, kiwi, and jackfruit; their available vegetables consist of okra, bitter gourd, sweet potato, shallots, taro and lotus roots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>SEAP\u2019s commitment to their customers is to provide their \u201cknowledge, skills and expertise in quality tropical fruits and vegetables combined with dedication, honesty and excellence\u201d; this allows them to \u201cdeliver and provide the best product and service to [their] valued customers and to the market.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also an avid member \u201cwithin the chamber of the wholesale markets,\u201d SEAP increases their awareness of the yearly changes within the industry by attending most of the meetings held at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), Nguyen believes that the major aspect of survival is the retailer\u2019s perceptions and ability to move a company\u2019s product. \u201cIf there\u2019s more retailers, and they don\u2019t survive there, it reduces our numbers.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Going forward, his main goal is to promote growth in SEAP\u2019s relationships with its suppliers. \u201cA lot of farmers are struggling in terms of what they grow, and try to get,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, we mainly try to cooperate with them, say what to grow for what season and also the quality there.

Currently shipping their products throughout Australia, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and Russia, the company is a collaboration between eight previously independent shareholders. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get the standards that we needed to get, so we decided to form one idea at one location\u201d says Chairman Frank Mercuri. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there since 1997, and since then we\u2019ve only had one packing house \u2013 and we had a grower shut down their own packing house. Now we all deliver our fruit as one organisation.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The decision to merge provoked the need to move to a more agriculturally convenient and profitable location. Pacific Fresh moved their operations to a new location in New South Wales, between Yanco and Leeton, and within the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area \u2013 a beneficial climate for the consistent growth of quality citrus fruit for their loyal customers. The company currently holds a 15 percent share of the citrus varieties grown in the Riverina region, along with a collective surface area of 1,800 acres of citrus and grape vines.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cAt the moment we\u2019ve got Navel oranges; we\u2019ve got Valencia oranges; we\u2019ve got some Mandarin lines including the Sumo mandarins. We\u2019ve got some pink flesh Navels; we\u2019re probably the biggest suppliers \u2013 biggest growers \u2013 in Australia of that variety.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To further ensure perfect condition of the fruit they pack, Pacific Fresh offers incentive to their growers based on the product they are able to produce. \u201cThe better fruit they grow, the more money they\u2019re going to make, because we pay on a pack-out basis. The more boxes we pack of their fruit, the more return they\u2019re going to have, and this has definitely changed over the last 10 years. We changed some growing practices because the growers wanted to grow better fruits, and make better money, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Strong relationships with these industry partners is key to the company\u2019s success as a whole, as it allows a trust system to be established between growers, packers and retailers. \u201cBecause of our quality, they don\u2019t need to check,\u201d says Mercuri. \u201cThey know what\u2019s expected to be in that box. They don\u2019t check to say, \u2018I want to see what it\u2019s like this week,\u2019 because they know it\u2019s going to be the same. Once we pack that fruit in that box \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter where it goes, it\u2019s always that same standard.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Over the years, Pacific Fresh has obtained partnerships with Coles and Woolworths through their achievement of Safe Quality Food (SQF), and Woolworths Quality Assurance (WQA) certifications; they have also earned Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) and Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) status. However, one of their bigger milestones, according to Mercuri, has been the introduction of the Sumo mandarin to the Australian market. \u201cWe brought the budwood from Japan to Australia in 2001, put it in quarantine for two years, and then we planted our first plantation in 2006. 2011 was our first harvest year, and it\u2019s been going really, really well.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">While there have not been many recent issues within the industry affecting Pacific Fresh and the state of their produce, Mercuri outlines increasing product cost as a potential reason for</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">market decline. \u201cThe industry is on a bit of a high at the moment with the China market being introduced to us two, three years ago \u2013 sort of growing every year,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any major issues in the next 12 months where the industry is going to fall over; unless some packers start packing the wrong fruit, sending them to China, and then the whole Australian industry comes down with it.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The major issues that we have in our industry is probably costs. We\u2019ve got to compete with the rest of the world, and they\u2019ve definitely got less grower costs, less packing costs \u2013 which makes their product cheaper on the market. Our quality and our taste is a lot better than those of other countries. I think if everyone does the right thing and pack the right standards \u2013 I can\u2019t see it falling over.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Before he was awarded his Chairman position in 2008, Mercuri was stationed as a field manager within the company; this allowed him to travel the world, experiencing alternate citrus varieties and produce growing strategies \u2013 some of which have been considered and implemented as procedure for Pacific Fresh. \u201cI think we\u2019ve gotten to a stage now where our growers know what they need to grow. We definitely introduced some hard practices they need to follow. I think I\u2019ve done that, and we\u2019re at the stage that we need to be.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ultimately, Mercuri reiterates the importance of strong relationships with growers and retailers in ensuring top-notch product quality and steady company revenue. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a good relationship there, everything falls into place.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au/pacific-fresh/\">Pacific Fresh</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au\">Australian Business News Source</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://abns.com.au/pacific-fresh/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Avocado Exports</title>\n\t\t<link>http://abns.com.au/avocado-exports/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://abns.com.au/avocado-exports/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 17:38:34 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Author]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food & Beverage]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Home Page Slider]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://abns.com.au/?p=5100</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\u00a0&#60;&#8211; click to view &#160; Avocados have always been the key to success for Jennie Franceschi.

Now serving as the Managing Director for Avocado Exports, Franceschi first started working with the fruit on her father\u2019s farm in 1974; her summer job soon became her passion, and she has carried that passion throughout her journey with the company.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cAvocados have probably been my life ever since that, and an industry that I love,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of really interesting people, and I know people from all over the world because I\u2019ve been in it quite a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 1987, Jennie and her husband Wayne moved to Pemberton, planting orchards to expand growing grounds beyond Perth. After 20 years of growth, the Franceschi\u2019s sold their share of the orchard, investing in a packing facility in Manjimup to meet the industry\u2019s high demands for their product, and focus more on the development markets for local growers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThe export company came about in 2009, and that was something we were equally passionate about.\u201d The company started through Avocados Australia, a key organisation within the industry. After a facilitated meeting was held to outline potential export models for industry leaders, Avocado Exports was formed.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2011, a conflict of interest arose with the current general manager, and Franceschi was asked to take over by fellow directors of the board. From there she continued to better the company, introducing any potential business plans where she saw fit. She ensures that the company is able to supply avocados year-round, and her current project involves the reduction of agricultural waste, made possible by the use of High Pressure Processing (HPP) and Individually Quick Frozen (IQF) methods by Avocado Exports and their shareholders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much product that doesn\u2019t get utilised \u2013 doesn\u2019t even make it to market,\u201d says Franceschi. \u201cI spent some of my journey looking at age care. I was trying to find a way to look at how to get a better deal, because currently they don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, some of the project that we\u2019re doing with the processing \u2013 which we call Fresh Produce Alliance \u2013 is about not only addressing a potential future oversupply situation for avocados, but what can we do for other horticultural commodities or agricultural commodities that helps utilise food waste so that we can give them, basically, a better return on their investment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to be able to make people in rural areas profitable, and so we created a mission outlining what we wanted to do, and that was to champion a sustainable agricultural ecosystem for future generations with innovative technology to produce naturally healthy delicious real foods that people love.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of Avocado Exports\u2019 main innovations for utilising agricultural waste is the use of HPP to add value to a product that is otherwise considered useless. Rejected fruits and vegetables are sent to the company\u2019s facility, where the HPP machine is put to work to repurpose what has been left behind. \u201cWe know that with HPP we can tenderise meat, so we would be able to potentially use lesser-graded cuts that are tougher and be able to use them and create something that\u2019s healthy and nutritious and then able to be eaten by our elderly community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the elderly community we\u2019re focussed on, we\u2019ve got some definite other lines that we\u2019re working on as well that is likely to be launched in the middle of the year, and I think these will be pretty exciting \u2013 both domestically and for export.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even with the growth of the industry, everything is done with sustainability in mind in order to preserve rural investments and expand possibilities for future business ventures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is create added value to farms. We want to make sure that they are supported, can grow and also retain those people in the rural areas to keep our communities stronger. The other thing that we want to do is try and create some opportunities for younger people, and I think that they quite often don\u2019t know about the technology and the options along those lines; they don\u2019t realise how exciting that food production and food science can be. So we\u2019d like to create some opportunities along that field.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thing is, with the industry, it is a growth industry. The past few years have been quite stable. The weather\u2019s been good, we haven\u2019t suffered dramatically over those sort of things. A lot of trees have gone in the ground and the volumes are considerably increasing going forward.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In about five years, Franceschi expects productivity to increase exponentially, with 6 or 7 million trays of avocados to be packed each year, from their packing operation themselves. This growth challenges the ability to maintain supply in order to meet demand, and access to HPP and IQF will make it easier for Avocado Exports to provide their products both locally and internationally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be able to get fruit by security protocol in other countries is a long process. Therefore, the reason why we are now developing other product lines in the process is because we can access international markets with processed products that we can\u2019t with fresh. The reason why we\u2019re doing it now [is] because we know [that] in, probably around five years\u2019 time we\u2019re really going to need it. If we are going to not get into an oversupply and domestic market collapse, then we need to think really hard about how we\u2019re going to grow our export market, and because of the market access issues, that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking at process.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In light of this knowledge, Franceschi has been asked to assist product development in Japan, Singapore and China. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to start at small markets and then grow it as production increases; but it\u2019s interesting, because market access is the biggest issue. I think this relates to not just avocados, but a lot of other products \u2013 and we\u2019re fortunate that we have a 12-month supply where others don\u2019t, and avocado is a very trending fruit.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But it hasn\u2019t always been that way. Before it was considered a superfood, the avocado sat at the top of what Franceschi refers to as \u201cthe dark food pyramid\u201d because of the amount of fat it contained. Since that reputation has been squashed, however, the demand for avocados has seen a great deal of growth. \u201cThat\u2019s an international global trend, and if we want to take advantage of it, then we can\u2019t rely on the government to suddenly get us market access. It doesn\u2019t happen that easy. This is why we\u2019re going down to minors of both IQF and HPP.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even in its processing practices, Avocado Exports takes care to abide by quality assurance standards. The company does everything in their power to make sure that the product is handled properly from when it leaves the facility to when it arrives at its designated location. A lot of time has been spent on promotion of product and education on proper handling techniques in order to ensure quality from farm to kitchen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of education, and that\u2019s a continuing cycle, because we need to teach them not only supply chain management, but also how to ripen them, how they can grow their business through doing different offers, and how they can do a more conditioned product to their customers.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Along with sustainability, commitment is important in assuring and maintaining quality products. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that industry and supply chain partners will work together for the greater good to make sure that we have some stability, and are proactive in dealing with these volumes as they come \u2013 and, the past 10 years, the industry has been very good at that.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Franceshi is happy with the partnerships that Avocado Exports has developed over the years, especially those that have contributed towards their future success. In 2012, the company won an Emerging Exporter Award at the Australian Export Awards; they credit Trade Investment Queensland for this endeavour, as the agency encouraged them to enter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWe just thought we were little fish in a big ocean. It might have been the growth that we had over that period of time when we had a high dollar. The export dollar was very high, so to get considerable growth when our dollar was so high, apparently, was quite a good feat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But that wouldn\u2019t have been possible if we didn\u2019t have things like Trade Investment Queensland that helped us do that education and try anything within the export marketplace. So, that wasn\u2019t just an achievement of the Avocado Export Company enough; that was a combined effort, and they played a very big role in that. So, it\u2019s not just about us, actually. It\u2019s every one of us that have put efforts. I\u2019m just the face of it. There are a lot of people that did a lot of work that made that possible. That was a highlight. I didn\u2019t realise how big of a deal it was until after we won it. But, apparently, it is quite a big deal. Allot of people contact us now because of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While Franceschi foresees growth in the production and sales of avocados, emphasis on the local market is also crucial in ensuring the future of the industry. \u201cI think what\u2019s really important is that Australians really should make an effort to support Australian farmers, because our future food security depends upon it. Australian farmers do an excellent job, and the reason why Australian produce is so highly valued overseas is because of our food safety.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The reason why they all want our food is because it\u2019s safe and our water is safe. So, we have added value in our products simply for that reason alone. Rather than sell our land, we should continue to farm it and sell off our product. Because we are so compliant with our food safety issues means that we have something that many countries don\u2019t have, and that is important to hang onto.\u201d<br />\nAvocado Exports has a lot of offer in the avenue of produce, both locally and internationally; their commitment to their customers is something they take pride in, along with their year-round product availability. \u201cWe\u2019re also very stable in pricing, so we don\u2019t change the price every week,\u201d says Franceschi. \u201cA lot of our customers are also food-service customers and know of other countries and by educating them on how to ripen it, keeping pricing stable and keeping supply steady, it just means that they stay local \u2013 because, I would say, that\u2019s a key thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au/avocado-exports/\">Avocado Exports</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au\">Australian Business News Source</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://abns.com.au/avocado-exports/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Raymond Vincent Homes</title>\n\t\t<link>http://abns.com.au/raymond-vincent-homes/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://abns.com.au/raymond-vincent-homes/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 17:33:39 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Author]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Construction]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://abns.com.au/?p=5097</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\u00a0&#60;&#8211; click to view &#160; Formed in 1973, Raymond Vincent Homes got its start as a franchise building operation for Sydney-based Lyndsay Edmonds Homes.

It wasn\u2019t until the early 1990s that the company took off from its franchise building partners and became something of its very own. \u201cWe opened our first display firm and started marketing our own brand,\u201d says Managing Director Raymond Vincent. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued marketing through display homes since then.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the company initially received a great amount of interest \u2013 servicing up to 65 houses at one given time \u2013 Vincent saw a more beneficial option in downsizing, as this would allow for further emphasis on the quality of each home and less of a \u201cfactory\u201d feel for him and his associates. A new display home has been beneficial, allowing the company to increase in revenue just before Christmas, but still remain in control of its size.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The focus on quality is apparent for Raymond Vincent Homes, as they make sure that each house is specifically designed to not only meet the needs of the client, but also appeal to the unique layout of each building site. \u201cWe try and take in any benefits the site has such as slope, or views and orientation and, of course, we take into account the owner\u2019s budget.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Accessibility of these homes to clients is also an important feature. One of the more intriguing projects was a beachfront property sold late last year to a trio of elderly sisters. The main goal in making this house a home for these clients was to provide accommodation for their physical needs. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed the house to give them reasonable level access from the road to the house, and the house is three storeys high,\u201d says Vincent. \u201cAll of the living spaces and bedrooms in the house face the views to the ocean. So, that\u2019s going to be an interesting one for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to this venture, the directors also provides their services to families of sick children by providing affordable holiday units through Apex, Apex members raised money from the community to purchase a piece of beach-adjacent land. \u201cWe built six holiday units with mostly volunteer labour for that purpose,\u201d says Vincent. \u201cThe units have been well-used since then, and they\u2019re still currently used on a regular basis \u2013 and they\u2019re still maintained in excellent condition.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vincent has had a large focus on community service outside of just his business. More recently he has been involved with Angel Flight Australia, which provides medical flight services to those living outside of the city. He was also elected Citizen of the Year within the local council, and has won many awards in accordance with the company through the Housing Industry Association (HIA) and the Master Builders Association (MBA); the company places as a finalist most times they enter.<br />\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very lucky with the building awards for the HIA and the MBA,\u201d he says. \u201cWe won awards with the MBA for best display home, and best design and construction of a house between one and two million dollars; and with the Housing Industry Association, we\u2019ve won the best house in New South Wales, South Coast and country areas, and best renovation under five hundred thousand.\u201d</p>\n<p>In fact, the company\u2019s strong relationship with the HIA and the MBA has gained them more than merit awards. Vincent is a member of the South Coast sector of both of these organisations, and they work hard to provide Raymond Vincent Homes with any help they need to remain top-tier in the industry. \u201cWe have a fair bit of dealings with both of those organisations,\u201d says Vincent. \u201cWe often consult them for advice on construction and legal matters. We have advice and assistance from them with work health and safety, with our stationery, with our office systems. Both those organisations give us updates on new products and updates on building code of Australia amendments and government regulations as well as economic updates.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These updates are important to success within the industry, as it allows business owners to see any patterns that may affect their companies. Currently, Vincent foresees a possible shortage of tradesmen as something to monitor for the future; his solution? More working apprentices. \u201cWe\u2019ve come through a very steady period over the last four or five years where we haven\u2019t had a boom or bust cycle. But, I think if we do get a boom come through \u2013 which happens now and again \u2013 there may not be enough tradesmen to go around. I don\u2019t think we have enough apprentices being trained up at the moment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have an apprentice, and we\u2019ve had apprentices, probably, for the last 15 years; but, I don\u2019t think the industry as a whole are training enough apprentices. The MBA and the HIA both have group apprenticeships, which are helping a bit. But I think there should be a bit more emphasis on builders themselves actually training up more tradesmen.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Employing their own longstanding carpenters has certainly been a benefit for Raymond Vincent Homes, as it guarantees the quality of the workmanship each project will receive \u2013 especially regarding the complex nature of the houses they build. \u201cThe tradesmen are out there trying to get the job done in a set amount of time to make a dollar they\u2019re going to be paid anyway. So, we have instruction that our carpenters do the job right and we don\u2019t have to worry about coming back. The subcontract tradesmen that we use, we have established over time. Some of our tradesman have worked with us for over 30 years.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After his past experiences with upsizing, Vincent\u2019s ongoing aim is to keep the company reasonably small in order to ensure the satisfaction of the clients, the staff, and the industry partners of Vincent Raymond Homes. \u201cThe company should focus on providing the clients with the house that they want, not the house that you want to give them; do that at the price, and try to maintain good relationships with your clients at all costs. Also maintain good relationships with your industry suppliers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We\u2019re fortunate that a lot of our suppliers support our company with assistance in advertising initiatives, and that only comes about by having good relationships with your suppliers. I think you need to be happy with what you\u2019re doing, and happy with the products you\u2019re producing. Your staff is very important. You need to look after your staff. Our staff don\u2019t leave. Our problem is not losing staff; it\u2019s more paying them for long service. So, we\u2019re very serious about looking after our staff and making working conditions the best we can. We always try and do the best we can as far as the standard of work on our jobs is. We don\u2019t take any shortcuts. We always comply with all of the regulations, and we take a lot of pride in what we produce.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au/raymond-vincent-homes/\">Raymond Vincent Homes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au\">Australian Business News Source</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://abns.com.au/raymond-vincent-homes/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Domus Homes</title>\n\t\t<link>http://abns.com.au/domus-homes/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://abns.com.au/domus-homes/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 17:31:43 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Author]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Construction]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://abns.com.au/?p=5094</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\u00a0&#60;&#8211; click to view &#160; Twelve years ago, David Edelstein left the property development corporate world to pursue his interest in the home development industry for domestic clients, confident that he would create a successful business using what he had learned from the top tier property developers. \u201cFrom my experience in the big end of [&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au/domus-homes/\">Domus Homes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au\">Australian Business News Source</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://abns.com.au/wp-content/magazine/april2016/#52-53\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5095\" src=\"http://abns.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-06-at-11.05.23-am-300x194.png\" alt=\"Domus Homes\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" /></a>\u00a0&lt;&#8211; click to view</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Twelve years ago, David Edelstein left the property development corporate world to pursue his interest in the home development industry for domestic clients, confident that he would create a successful business using what he had learned from the top tier property developers. \u201cFrom my experience in the big end of town, I determined that there was a need for a similar type of model for the smaller house building client,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t invent this concept \u2013 I learned this concept from listed property development companies. So I took this concept of managing a process from concept to completion; managing all the components so the client is only having to deal with one person from the beginning right through to the end, and that\u2019s how the idea of Domus Homes and its particular service evolved.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through Domus Homes, Edelstein was able to work out a system that allowed for this singular contact to function within a home development environment. A development manager holds responsibility for the management of all facets of each project \u2013 connecting with architects, builders and consultants to create the perfect home for each client, in both appearance and budget. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly unique model for new home and renovation delivery, because we remain separated from the builders and the consultants. We manage them, but we are not the builders nor the consultants. The only services that we provide are the project management, full architectural services, and optional full interior design services \u2013 and the rest are contracted directly by the client, but managed by Domus Homes on their behalf; that\u2019s the basic model of how we work, and it\u2019s completely transparent. The clients get complete transparency; but we\u2019re a boutique company, so the clients work with me \u2013 the boss of my company. They know I want to grow my company, so they know they\u2019re going to get a really good service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the years, what I\u2019ve devised is the same model for the consultants and builders. I have located the best consultants who are smaller operators with lower overhead structures, but we only work with the bosses of those consultancies. Same with the builders \u2013 smaller builders, very experienced, and we work only directly with the bosses of those companies. Therefore, the clients get the very best service from highly experienced operators, but at the lowest possible fees, because of their extensive experience and low overhead business structures.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Providing their services within a 25 kilometre radius from Sydney \u2013 including the eastern suburbs, the inner west and the lower north shore \u2013 Domus Homes follows an easy and safe six step process that ensures guidance \u201cfrom concept to completion.\u201d Clients are also entitled to a complimentary appointment at the beginning of their process; whether they require a new home or renovation for their semi-detached home, terrace, apartment or luxury home, Domus Homes has them covered. A survey and measure-up provides enough criteria for an initial sketch plan to be designed, which is then followed by development application (DA) documentation; the plans and consultant reports are then submitted to council and, following approval, all the necessary materials and services are gathered for the construction documentation. After the construction tenders are submitted and after negotiating the best price possible for the client, their signatures will allow construction to commence \u2013 a process that is only complete when they are happy with what they see.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSomebody needs a bulldoze, the bulldozer will be on site. Smaller operators, lower overhead structures; there\u2019s pressure on costs all the way through, but you\u2019re getting the best and most intensive service at the most economical prices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We give our clients direct access to our network of wholesalers. We open the doors for them, the clients pay them direct, the wholesalers quote them direct \u2013 I get copies of these quotes, and manage all of it for them. All of the fit out products they get at the wholesale price, again putting pressure on the price downwards so that we can deliver a fine product at the lowest price possible; they\u2019re getting the best value for money for a great designer product all the way through.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While Domus Homes maintains their low price guarantee, they are also backed by some of the industry\u2019s best tradesmen; they are able to apply their architectural skills from a wide range of projects towards even the simplest home developments. \u201cThe architects that we work with have got decades of experience; they\u2019re all involved in cutting edge projects in Sydney \u2013 massive projects such as shopping centres, high rise, medium rise, residential \u2013 and then they work for Domus Homes as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The result is that Domus Homes and its clients get the benefit of the very best architects that you can hire in Sydney, but at the economical Domus Homes price. So, what we do is, we deliver top architecture, or top architects, at very economical prices. We are a highly competitive business in terms of our fees and provide intensive management throughout. So, our proven network of people, what they bring to the design aspects of a small renovation, big renovation, new home \u2013 are cutting edge practices of sustainable building ideas delivered into the smaller developments at highly competitive rates.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au/domus-homes/\">Domus Homes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au\">Australian Business News Source</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://abns.com.au/domus-homes/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Linzen Property Group</title>\n\t\t<link>http://abns.com.au/linzen-property-group/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://abns.com.au/linzen-property-group/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 17:28:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Author]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Construction]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://abns.com.au/?p=5091</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\u00a0&#60;&#8211; click to view &#160; Linzen Property Group formed their roots in South Africa, orchestrating and project managed multimillion-dollar development projects.

After 25 years of successful business on the home front, Susan Lindeque and her associates moved to Australia in order to pursue alternative business ventures. Adapting to a new housing development market presented an initial challenge for the company; but hands-on learning smoothed the adaptation process, and has allowed sufficient progress over the last six years.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had to start all over,\u201d says Lindeque. \u201cWe had to learn the systems of council, Tax Laws, Company Structures; how to work with all the regulations and just learn the back structure. So, it took more than a year to understand all the Laws and Regulations \u2013 just really starting over \u2013 looking at what we had to do and where we want to go.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We found opportunity in Brisbane, and we did just a small subdivision, which we started off, and we successfully completed that in 2014, where we started looking for other bigger developments. After we\u2019d done the small one, we then saw that we were quite comfortable with all the regulations with council and all the legal requirements around any development.\u201d</p>\n<p>Linzen Property Group\u2019s current focus is Dakabin Crossing, a master plan development in the North Lakes area which includes 134 townhouses, 8 apartments and a retail precinct; housing sizes range from two to four bedroom townhouses and terraces, and the retail precinct offers residents a coffee, bakery shop and convenience store \u2013 all within minutes of the local school and train station. The company is wholeheartedly committed to making sure that their home owners are comfortable and all of their domestic needs are met.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously development and construction are our first love, and that\u2019s what we do,\u201d says Lindeque. \u201cBut we take personal care of all our developments by doing our own in-house property management, and we take care of the management rights in the whole development ourselves. We believe that nobody will be able to look better after our own developments than ourselves. We have a complete in-house team that can look after all our owners and investors.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a team, Linzen Property Group takes care in addressing resident and client concerns in a reasonably prompt fashion, tending to any problem within 48 hours. The confidence of their tenants is something the company holds in high regard, as it ultimately affects their peace of mind as well. \u201cIf you have happy tenants at the end of the day, you\u2019ve got a happy landlord.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Innovation and integrity are important qualities for Linzen Property Group; they ensure that these qualities are practiced throughout their business, continuously looking for different ways to improve design and construction for each project while still managing to take natural space into consideration. Control of a project is key to its prosperity for the company, but consistent delivery to their clients is another top priority.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe that, for the industry, it\u2019s important that you focus on what the market wants \u2013what we need to develop; what our product design would be in accordance to that. Then, we basically coordinate our strategies around that.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t believe we can be everything to anyone, but we do believe that the relationships that we\u2019ve got with our staff, suppliers, and companies is of high value. We give them absolute customer service, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to boil down to.\u201d<br />\nIn regards to Dakabin Crossing, Linzen Property Group currently has 21 project consultants that they work with directly on a regular basis, and 50 employees will be recruited to help kick-start the construction process. Lindeque and her associates got other projects in the pipeline that they will start soon. The main five-year plan is to establish a recognised brand for Linzen Property Group and to expand staffing towards 150 to 250 employees. \u201cWe believe in absolute team spirit to build our organisation, and to deliver on time and within budget.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We put extreme value on teamwork, loyalty and trust in all our relationships.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Creativity is very important to us as well, because we are open to imagine what\u2019s possible and we are open to new opportunities. We always look for changing and innovating difficult opportunities.\u201d Providing a good product and good quality service through difficult times can help in combatting and, ultimately, reducing the long-term risks of any development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lindeque got her first taste of property development when she was just five years old; she started by helping her father with painting jobs, and the passion grew from there. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She qualified as a Chartered Accountant and from there the company slogan \u201cdriven by financial intelligence\u201d as she believes that a good business is built on in-depth financial analysis, solid corporate governance and passion. Her dedication to her craft has helped her work with not only local businesses, but many multi international businesses over the years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For Linzen Property Group, ambition dedication and persistence are necessary for confidence and success within the industry; their 30-year history is proof that any obstacle can be mounted if you possess a strong will in what you do. \u201cDo whatever you want to achieve in life \u2013 just make your start and go for it,\u201d says Lindeque. \u201cYou will learn down the way, as we all do, that there are sometimes ups and downs, but the end result is very rewarding. If you\u2019re willing to pursue the route, you will get results and be successful.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au/linzen-property-group/\">Linzen Property Group</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au\">Australian Business News Source</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://abns.com.au/linzen-property-group/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Conrad Gargett</title>\n\t\t<link>http://abns.com.au/conrad-gargett/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://abns.com.au/conrad-gargett/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 17:24:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Author]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Construction]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://abns.com.au/?p=5088</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\u00a0&#60;&#8211; click to view &#160; For 126 years, Conrad Gargett has maintained a strong foundation within the architecture industry.

So, that\u2019s a main reason for becoming a bit more widely established.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another important reason to ensure variation within the architecture industry is the range of projects available within different spectrums of the trade. \u201cArchitecture\u2019s a fairly wide market; it starts from conceptual design, right through to administration of a contract, and it also encounters a huge spectrum of sectors from residential, right through to the most complex institutional. So, we\u2019ve had to develop expertise in a broad range of services in order to maximise our interface with the industry.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conrad Gargett\u2019s body of work has varied from the occasional house, to bigger projects within the institutional market. More recently, the company in joint venture with Lyons were the architects for the Lady Cilento Children\u2019s Hospital \u2013 a billion-dollar project that has won them several national and international awards. Wolfe thinks the involvement in this project was a great way to build community confidence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a change in the way that hospitals are regarded. Hospitals used to be places where you built walls around sick people. Now \u2013 particularly with pediatric facilities \u2013 they\u2019re an opportunity to connect community with the hospital so that the children don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being taken out of their normal surrounds and ostracised into a place of sickness. So, it\u2019s really a place of well-being. I think if architects create these environments that respond to context, there is a confidence that the community has in design fulfilling a need.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both Wolfe and fellow Director Lawrence Toaldo have had a hand in a variety of higher scale projects, respectively, in the health and defense sectors of business; their presence within these industrial realms has provided an influence on further design for similar public institutions. One of their key roles in completing dignified, successful projects is maximising their value.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at a brief, and a site or a property, a key role is making sure that you\u2019ve maximised that value,\u201d says Toaldo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that if we do that in quite an analytical way, then that\u2019s when our project succeeds; that\u2019s something we try and focus on through the entire design process \u2013 from the analysis of the master plan and the siting of buildings, right down to the selection of materials and finishes \u2013 always analysing what value each decision is bringing to the project.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ongoing changes in Australia\u2019s economical structure is not unfamiliar to the architectural sector. Job opportunities continue to wax and wane, causing architects to expand their horizons to other facets of the industry, including client-side organisations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThe design profession is being more creative about what the design opportunities are, and I think you\u2019ve seen architects move into different areas of project management, design management, and development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, I think that, even though the industry has been sort of tumultuous over the last five to eight years, architects have always been very creative about how we can apply our skills. But, right now there is a bit of a demand for design practices in the residential area, and I think the opportunities there are still going to be with us for a little while longer\u201d says Toaldo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Establishing creative ground and perfecting projects are very important to Conrad Gargett; but, in order to ensure the satisfaction of the client, the quality of the business itself must be considered. The company has recognised this fact, constantly evaluating the practices and values of their business, and outlining key qualities for success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of the key things we have come up with are: that the things that we do every day are valuable so that, regardless of the type of building that you\u2019re working on \u2013 whether its an incredibly important piece of public infrastructure, or whether it\u2019s a house extension \u2013 they\u2019re valuable things that we\u2019re doing because they impact on people\u2019s lives; we take a lot of pride and do the best job possible. So, it\u2019s evaluating what we do. I think the other important aspect is the natural environment, and it\u2019s why we\u2019re really pleased that we\u2019ve got a landscape architectural discipline within our practice. Preserving the natural environment, protecting it and enhancing it, is a core part of what we do as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The company also places emphasis on the self-development of their team. Encouraging staff to do their best to \u201ccontinually train and develop professionally\u201d is consistently practiced, with a program in place to help ensure this growth. \u201cI think the other one fundamentally comes back to architecture as an act of improving the human condition. So, we take our social responsibilities very heavily as well. The sorts of buildings we build are really part of the social fabric. Whether they\u2019re hospitals, schools, or police stations \u2013 those sorts of buildings that are a really important part of the social fabric \u2013 we really spend a lot of time getting those buildings right.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trust is one of the most valued actions for Conrad Gargett, and has been in its many years of operation. \u201cThe establishment of trust through enduring relationships has been really important, and it\u2019s something that you can\u2019t build up instantaneously,\u201d says Toaldo. \u201cOnce you have it, you can build on it; but it\u2019s very easy to lose as well. So, continually working to get the trust of our clients, project managers, user groups, and our wider design team is really important, and is something we work pretty hard on achieving right through our networks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, that has to be right through the top of our organisation \u2013 right through to all of our team that work on our projects \u2013 so, regardless of the type of project we\u2019re working on, the client has trust in what we\u2019re trying to do; that\u2019s probably the core of what cements our relationships right throughout the industry.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking at true innovation, you really need a client and project manager, and a contractor that can trust you. It\u2019s very difficult to be innovative and push the envelope without that trust in place. So, once you\u2019ve got that foundation of trust, you can really leverage the most out of a project.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the main issues affecting the architectural industry, according to Toaldo, is responsibility for building procurement \u2013 the question of who is \u201cbest placed\u201d to handle projects within the main group of engaged players. \u201cDepending on the type of building and the risk profile of it, you get all sorts of different answers,\u201d he says. \u201cI still think that the industry is finding it difficult to lead those practices, and as those decisions change, architects find themselves at the top of the tree, or somewhere in the middle, and it does fundamentally change our role.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Development of Australia\u2019s \u201chousing bubble\u201d is another factor for which Conrad Gargett is prepared. \u201cI think some of that will come to fruition this year, whether there is in fact oversupply or undersupply,\u201d says Wolfe. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of work in that sphere as well as in institutional buildings. We believe some time this year, some of the projects that are mooted to occur may not occur in the residential sector. But, I think the residential sector is still pretty strong, and we\u2019ll see they are continuing to grow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the institution and infrastructure work, I think there\u2019s a growing understanding that infrastructure builds the capital of the nation \u2013 it builds efficiency; it makes cities more effective. I think we\u2019ll see spending in that area, because they\u2019ll want to boost the economy of the state and the cities. So, I expect to see infrastructure coming back into contingence there. We believe that there\u2019s some growth still in our industry in the coming years, and we hope to serve that.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When he joined Conrad Gargett in 1982, Wolfe had no idea that he would ever become a Managing Director. His \u201csole aim\u201d at that time was to ensure positive outcomes on the design and application of building projects. Completing a few buildings with the company and winning a few university design competitions helped provide him with that confidence. When he was offered the position, Wolfe accepted with reservations, as it meant that he would spend less time on the front lines of the architecture industry \u2013 designing and documenting buildings. Since then, he has grown within his management position, and is certainly proud of the work that he has done, especially his \u201csatisfying\u201d role in the Lady Cilento project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Concurrently, Wolfe\u2019s role as the chapter president is a \u201creassuring\u201d position for this stage of his career. In the new year, both he, Toaldo and the leadership teamwill strive to make sure that Conrad Gargett remains a \u201cleading practice\u201d within the industry in the coming years \u2013 not just in Brisbane and Sydney, but all throughout Australia.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a challenging industry to be in,\u201d says Wolfe. \u201cIt has its ups and downs \u2013 just how the market sees itself at any particular time \u2013 and I think there\u2019s greater challenges in the future of just how buildings are made, because they\u2019re still made en masse the same way they were thousands of years ago; you put one thing on top of the other.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Otherwise, building hasn\u2019t really had a great effect in the markets here; but, I think there\u2019ll be a lot more of the pre-fabrication happening in the next decade, and how that is married into quality designing outcomes is really the big challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au/conrad-gargett/\">Conrad Gargett</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au\">Australian Business News Source</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://abns.com.au/conrad-gargett/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Trevelle Homes</title>\n\t\t<link>http://abns.com.au/trevelle-homes/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://abns.com.au/trevelle-homes/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 17:18:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Author]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Construction]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Home Page Slider]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://abns.com.au/?p=5083</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\u00a0&#60;&#8211; click to view &#160; Since 2006, Trevelle Homes has had a growing presence within the commercial and residential markets of New South Wales.

The company started as a small family business between Eddie Treffiletti and his two sons and daughter, building a small number of homes each year. \u201cWe just started with that, and probably doing a little bit of commercial work, a little bit of residential work, not knowing which way we were going,\u201d says Managing Director Treffiletti. \u201cWe decided to just concentrate on the residential side of things, and we\u2019ve progressed from there into what we\u2019re now doing \u2013 close to eighty (80) homes a year, realistically.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The demand for more homes over the years caused the company to expand past its roots as a small family business. Trevelle Homes is now a larger commercial-style builder with more employees outside of the family circle. Range in product has increased to accommodate anywhere from first-home buyers to million-dollar third &amp; fourth home buyers, including townhouse, duplex\u2019s and single &amp; double storey multi units. When building any property, Treffiletti makes sure to include various different aspects from his extensive building background in order to create unique, sensible homes for clients.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI always incorporate a lot more knowledge of commercial building to be able to give the clients different styles of building while still keeping mind of the budgets that most families have in relation to building a standard residential home,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you do go to a commercial builder, you pay a lot more than what you would through a residential builder; but I try and incorporate that together and give them the right result.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the satisfaction of the client is a key aspect of the business, Trevelle Homes also understands the merit of recognition within the industry. Not only have their seven display homes brought them a lot of local attention, but the company has also entered as finalists in many awards over the years. \u201cIn 2011, we entered two of our homes into the MBA housing awards receiving a merit for our single storey and winning the double storey excellence in housing award for Exhibition Homes $300 000 &amp; over,\u201d says Treffiletti. \u201cOur main achievement has been to be able to grow, possibly every year; to go from a small family business. We hope to think we\u2019re becoming a corporate business now.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Establishing a great reputation is important in any industry, a reality of which Trevelle Homes is aware; they are currently members of the Master Builders Association (MBA), as well as the Housing Industry Association (HIA); these associations help in the instilment of trust by the client to get the job done accurately and professionally. Membership also allows the company access to well-known industry suppliers, especially within the local realm. \u201cOne of the major things for us is to make sure we\u2019re using the major suppliers in the industry, and that\u2019s what we do. We push to use the local stuff, and we only use well-known suppliers.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main issue Treffiletti predicts for the future is the decrease in land availability, which will be mutually exclusive with the increase in pricing for what is available. Luckily, for clients of building companies like Trevelle Homes, an expensive property doesn\u2019t necessarily signify expensive construction; building costs will remain stagnant and affordable, and there will be a greater overall value once the market is stabilised. \u201cThe price can\u2019t keep going up because no one\u2019s going to foot the bills otherwise,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is signs of that now, because six months ago we couldn\u2019t find any land to be able to offer our clients, and now developers are coming and offering it to us to help them sell their land. The package we offer is a house and land package. So, I think that\u2019s a very important factor for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the years, Trevelle Homes has found success in expanding their building demographic \u2013 starting from anything and everything, and progressing to their current status, accompanied by several client-catching display homes. But, according to Treffiletti, it won\u2019t stop there; the company\u2019s future plans are in perpetual motion, including market expansion towards North West Sydney to take advantage of a market well suited to Trevelles design standard. The aim is to grow the business by any possible means, putting Trevelle Homes on the map as one of New South Wales\u2019 go-to home builders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve been doing this all my life. I\u2019ve been into high-rise building \u2013 which is a lot of concrete and formwork \u2013 which is another market completely. I decided I\u2019d had enough of that after 25 years, and decided to go into residential, which I really didn\u2019t know much about. Over the course of under 10 years, I\u2019ve turned it into a pretty successful business and I\u2019d like to be one of the major players eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au/trevelle-homes/\">Trevelle Homes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au\">Australian Business News Source</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://abns.com.au/trevelle-homes/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Wimpak</title>\n\t\t<link>http://abns.com.au/wimpak/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://abns.com.au/wimpak/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 17:18:38 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Author]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food & Beverage]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://abns.com.au/?p=5062</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\u00a0&#60;&#8211; click to view &#160; Ideally located \u201cin the heart of the Wimmera grain growing region,\u201d Minyip-based export company Wimpak has strived to be the best at their craft.

Established in 1998 by a group of local farmers \u2013 and now serviced by 12 permanent staff members \u2013 the vision was \u201cto build a local grain packing facility specialising in pulse type grains\u201d that would provide thorough cleaning and packing services to North West Victoria; its home-grown commitment is something to be recognised, as it is a quality that separates Wimpak from the rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to the company\u2019s Director, Geoff Rethus, \u201cUnlike many of its competitors in the Wimmera-Mallee region, Wimpak is still 100 percent owned by members of the local farming community, with profits being re-invested into the company to improve efficiencies and continue our growth.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rethus was one of 10 unit holders present at the conception of Wimpak, and has held several executive positions throughout that time. After almost 20 years of service, increased preparation for growth has been essential to the company\u2019s success. Storage has increased from 500 tonnes to 13,000 tonnes, and the addition of 42 silos and a shed have allowed for \u201cplenty of segregations of product.\u201d This expansion has proven beneficial over the last six years, especially, with an increase in turnover by 80.76 percent and up to $35 million annually.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the biggest milestones for Wimpak has been the restructure of both management and executive structures, with different segments of the business being managed by five key members. \u201cThis has ensued a very professionally run company with shared responsibilities,\u201d says Rethus. \u201cThe executive also now includes professionals from outside the company to provide specialist skills in areas that are required from time to time. As a result, the workplace is very harmonious to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Introduction of new equipment in 2014 has also assisted the prosperity of Wimpak in its future endeavours. The goal was to double production, allowing double the amount of grains to be cleaned per hour. To meet this goal, the company started from the bottom to design and build a new processing plant to specifically meet their needs; it is currently the only plant of its kind in Australia, which helped meet industry demands in the region\u2019s most recent harvest. Other additions to the facility include a larger weighbridge and site office, a drive-over hopper, and a browntree bag loader to eliminate the need for manual handling of product.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This improved production facility is \u201ca huge step forward in technology\u201d for not only Wimpak, but the grain cleaning industry as a whole. A single touch-screen controls all operations and, from there, data can be synced to an iPad or mobile device in order to monitor plant production down to the individual weight of each bag; this new technology will provide Wimpak with an advantage both locally and internationally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The purpose of seed and grain cleaning is to add value to a product, and this is thoroughly recognised by the staff at Wimpak; they have also gained the ability to clean grains that exceed Australian Pulse Standards, which allows competitive prices to be placed by growers on their refurbished product.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cEstablishing and maintaining personal relationships with our growers is a high priority,\u201d says Rethus. \u201cIn addition to this, Wimpak is constantly expanding its broader sourcing area; originally focused on grains produced in the Minyip/Murtoa area, we now accumulate from the Northern Mallee to the Southern Wimmera and from the SA Border to Central Victoria.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The company\u2019s unwavering focus on locality is demonstrated annually through their attendance at local field days and grower information events; their support of a variety of local football/netball, golf, and other field and game clubs \u2013 which also included a major sponsorship for the Minyip Primary School Netball court upgrade; and their presence as members of the Grain Industry Association of Victoria (GIAV), Grain Trade Australia (GTA), Pulse Australia and Pulse Victoria \u2013 all of which \u201cprovide a great networking opportunity with other key stakeholders\u201d in the industry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Communication with the company\u2019s own stakeholders is also a commitment. This includes relaying peak production times, price updates, latest news and events through radio advertising and text messaging, and distribution of a quarterly newsletter to all shareholders in the business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wimpak is able to provide their services towards a variety of pulse grains, including beans, chickpeas, lentils, lupins, Field peas, safflower, vetch and fenugreek; cereals such as wheat, barley and oats are also available for the local stockfeed markets. All products are either bagged or bulked, farmer or machine dressed, and gravity graded. Each round of product is shipped to Melbourne via rail by Wimmera Container Lines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWe increase demand by expanding Wimpak\u2019s network of exporters/buyers. By building relationships and dealing with only reputable exporters, Wimpak is able to minimise risks involved with trading commodities and can provide competitive market options for growers and guarantee timely payment.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Currently, Wimpak products are exported directly from Melbourne to Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Indian Subcontinent, and the United States. The focus of exports is mostly pulse grains, which are offered on a Delivered Container Terminal (DCT) basis; they are packed in 20\u2019 containers and transhipped between locations \u2013 before and after which they are inspected and documented by DAFF Authorised Officers to ensure that they meet requirements for DA Biosecurity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Safe product handling procedures at home is also a key practice to ensure food security. Along with the implementation of their browntree bag loader Wimpak has also introduced an \u201cefficient and streamlined work health and safety (WHS)\u201d program; this program provides specific solutions for compliance activities in order to make sure the company is heeding to Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) legislative requirements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sustainability is another key effort that Wimpak works hard to adhere to. The new LMC cleaner has proven to be 20 percent more efficient than the previous cleaning method, heeding more product with the same amount of energy usage; to improve the efficiency of quantity measurement, container scales have now been mounted onto trailers to provide a more accurate volume. LED lights have been installed for flood lighting after dark \u2013 with future installation of solar panels in the works \u2013 and a new hammer mill also allows for usage of products that would otherwise be wasted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will now be utilising what were previously waste products (offal) from our cleaning activities and processing this waste through the hammer mill in order to produce pollard,\u201d says Rethus. \u201cPollard will be sold to stock feed mills that use this product as an additive in the manufacture of various stock feed products.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wimpak also takes care to collect any rainwater runoff for use in plumbing, gardening, dust suppression and fire control, but recent drought has been one of the main issues affecting Australia\u2019s grain industry.

Formed by third-generation builder Brad Maggs \u2013 along with one of his six brothers \u2013 the company began with a focus towards residential building, and fought through the Global Financial Crisis to expand towards a more commercially orientated company. In late 2008, after his brother sought to pursue an alternative career in the haulage industry, Maggs partnered with good friend Austin Bell to continue to grow the business. The company now invests in a variety of projects from start to finish, crossing all disciplines of construction, to ensure a client\u2019s wide variety of needs are met, all under the one banner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even through their positive propulsion towards the commercial building market, BDM Constructions still stays true to their core values. The company is committed to providing single-dwelling construction services to their loyal customers, as that facet of business reflects the initial \u201croots\u201d that helped solidify their current reputation. \u201cPeople identify BDM Constructions from where we\u2019ve come from as home builders. Our targeted markets are all property developments, commercial &amp; multi-res construction and land subdivision work. The unique operation of BDM that stands us apart from most other similar construction companies is that we\u2019re able to do any part of construction, from the securing of greenfield sites for land subdivision right through. There are 5 departments within BDM, Feasibility/Consulting &amp; Design, Shop fitting &amp; Minor Works, Residential Construction, Commercial Construction, Excavation &amp; Concreting. \u201cWe have the expertise to facilitate projects from design faze right the way through to delivery.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Operating under the premise of a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for clients, Maggs and his current staff \u2013 which have expanded from 12 to 50 in order to accommodate market demand \u2013 rely on community confidence to be able to grow their business. BDM Constructions currently has offices in Sydney and Port Macquarie, offering a wide range of quality, cost-effective services to both the local and broader regional market. One of the company\u2019s main eye-catching business ventures is a $30 million apartment complex set to grace Port Macquarie very soon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cThe quality of what we produce and the service that we deliver is seen visually, this has realised a rapid growth as word of mouth from satisfied clients spreads the knowledge of our ability,\u201d he says. \u201cOur head office is centred on the NSW Mid North Coast and this allow us to cover the state with ease. Our Sydney office covers the metropolitan and outer suburban areas. Our performance in the city and regionally has seen the company grow exponentially over the past 5 years\u201d.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have a branding and a presence that everybody identifies to; our mission statement is \u2018uncompromising quality is our foundation,\u2019 and that\u2019s something that we stand by, we try to make sure that we do not compromise. If it means something has to be pulled out and redone, that\u2019s what will happen if aspects of our construction initially are not up to BDM\u2019s high standards.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The company takes pride in the diversity of services they can offer to their clients. In addition to the wide range of construction and design options, BDM Constructions also stands by a guarantee of investment for each project; this includes the establishment of agreements with outside investors, or partial funding from the company to ensure the project is approved.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not many companies that can actually carry out and acts as the lead consultant on a project right from the initiation of design through to civil construction and residential development delivery, all on the one subdivision,\u201d says Maggs. \u201cWe can identify potential developments, run a feasibility study on a development, we can then have civil design underway knowing that the developer is looking at putting a multi-res development there, we can be working on the construction design for this in the background at the same time, with a different team from within BDM. Integrating those two things \u2013 there\u2019s not many companies that offer that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been a massive amount of opportunity over the last two or three years, since we have become connected to some high-level network individuals and investment groups that are in the property development industry. They have grabbed hold of what we offer. So, the opportunities have just really opened up. We\u2019ve been positioning ourselves in the market from the end of 2008, to be able to capitalise on opportunity when our skill set advantage was recognised by the right people and networks.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Their emphasis on \u201cuncompromising quality\u201d is something that BDM Constructions has worked hard to achieve, as the importance of honest and trustworthy work is a core value within their managerial structure. \u201cWe\u2019re the kind of people that have been taught work ethic from a young age,\u201d says Maggs. \u201cWe were lucky enough to have parents that had very strong core values \u2013</p>\n<p>High morals, high work ethic \u2013 and we\u2019ve just rolled our sleeves up and got into it as each opportunity has come along. We\u2019ve assessed each opportunity and each opportunity taken has been a stepping stone to where we are today. We have no grand vision other than to be as good as we can possibly be in what we do.\u201d</p>\n<p>BDM\u2019s commitment to value of being ethical at all times is a cornerstone the company has been built on \u2013 we\u2019re very open book. We\u2019re very straight-shooters. We don\u2019t fluff things up too much, but we will never take for granted anybody\u2019s commitment that they\u2019ve made to us in investing with us, or choosing us to work for them and carry out whatever part of the service we offer that they\u2019ve chosen to accept.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve made a mistake or something hasn\u2019t gone as well as expected, address it head on. Don\u2019t beat around the bush. Say that \u2018this is the situation, now let\u2019s work on the best outcome for all parties involved.\u2019 They\u2019re the values that have let us grow to the company we are today. There\u2019s not one person that\u2019s ever been successful that\u2019s not made a mistake. We\u2019ve made our fair share, and we faced them front-on and learnt from them.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Born into the industry, strong working relationships have always been a key factor for Maggs and his family. Five of his six brothers currently work in the industry, including his brother Jim, who works as the company\u2019s Operations Manager. Both he and his partner have a variety of friends and family working in the business, and these bonds have proven beneficial for the success of BDM Constructions. \u201cOur commitment to building excellent relationships with our staff, suppliers and subcontractors is the hub of what makes something successful,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople that you can rely on make all the difference to being able to make a business into a success. People are what make up a company. You can have the Managing Director of a company that possibly has the right values and the right ideas; but if the people underneath them aren\u2019t prepared to buy into them, success will be hard to find. Each employee needs to feel that they basically own a little part of that company and are making a positive contribution to the overall forward progression of the company.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you wish to excel and have a healthy sustainable business, you have to have people buy into that ownership of there role and create the culture that fosters this attitude towards their work. You\u2019ve got to be prepared to go the extra mile. If you\u2019ve got a supplier or a subcontractor that performs well and gives you great service, which needs rewarding with loyalty. We\u2019re not necessarily going to look at taking the cheapest price. You still want the price to be within the realms of reality, but the cheapest price is very rarely the best, and the working relationships formed between your management, your on-site staff, suppliers and subcontractors, is the absolute key to being able to deliver high-quality, profitable projects.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While BDM Constructions has managed to find continuous success within various aspects of the construction industry, Maggs recognises its complexity as a whole for other developing businesses. The growth of the demand on the housing industry in Sydney is a factor that may affect the future of many companies in the surrounding area, as well as the influx of international investors \u2013 especially within the apartment sector. Fuelled by oversupply in the apartment market, due to a drop in demand for apartments, which has been directly affected by the ability of Chinese investors to invest in the local market. The market could in the foreseeable future take a reasonable dip. The ripple effect \u2013 in some way, shape, or form \u2013 could be felt right across the industry, especially the Sydney apartment developments with a large percentage of off shore off the plan presold apartments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another major issue within the industry, according to Maggs, is the lack of skill level prevalent throughout the construction industry; this is something that he believes will have a gradual effect on the turnover of the industry and its suppliers. \u201cThe quality of trades and the quality of skilled people that have been trained in the last 10-15 years, is so much lower than those trained 10-15 years before that. So, there is skill shortage right across the board, and at the top of that is probably bricklayers as the trade is dwindling in high numbers. If something\u2019s not done about it soon to promote becoming a bricklayer or a blocklayer \u2013 and I believe that the masonry manufacturers need to get right on board with this \u2013 they won\u2019t be able to move their products as there\u2019ll be such a lack of tradesman to lay them. That\u2019s how bad it\u2019s getting with bricklaying; but its right across all trades in some shape or form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the largest problems is that your everyday Mum and Dad and your careers adviser at High Schools seem to think that to be a tradesman, you must be in the bottom 10 percent of academic performers, because they can lift heavy things. To be a good tradesman, you need to be a pretty switched-on character. You need to be driven and physically capable, but you need to be particularly strong in mathematics; the stronger knowledge you have, the higher education you have achieved, the better you are at thinking and problem solving, the better tradesman you\u2019re going to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From his own experience, Maggs believes that starting from the bottom provides the best pathway to success. \u201cMake your way to the top by learning from the bottom up and picking everything up as you go,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you know how to build it; you will know how to quote it properly; that will allow you to manage it properly. Coming in halfway along that process can be hard to backtrack \u2013 learn the basics. I\u2019d like to put out there that you can be very successful and have a great career starting as a tradesman.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the initial direction of career path was a debate between a structural engineer and a P.E. educator, his eagerness to work drove him towards a career that required more hands-on learning, than pursuing university education after Higher School Certificate graduation. The family construction business provided Maggs with the satisfaction that he needed for physical application, and the apprenticeship offered by his father provided him with the ability to train in a comfortable, familiar environment. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise at the time how beneficial the decision was going to be, and it wasn\u2019t a decision that was made with a lot of foresight. So, I probably had some luck come my way when I inadvertently became a carpenter &amp; Joiner to a degree. However I do apply myself to the best of my ability in whatever I do and that has put myself and BDM in the position it is today.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fortunate position the company and myself finds its self in is not something that I\u2019ve ever had a great vision to aspired to, but I just pushed myself to be as good as I can be, I have been fortunate enough to partner up with some very good people with similar ethics and outlook on life, from there what happens happens. The journey has seen some good people become lucky enough to work together \u2013 none more than my business partner, my fellow Director in BDM Constructions; I\u2019ve been lucky enough work with not only my best mate but also witness his ability to help me drive this business to where it is and celebrate his equal success with mine as a team. We\u2019re both very similar people in that we do not like to accept failure so we ensure that does not have to be considered as an option.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Maggs is more than happy with the decisions he has made in having Bell as a business partner; their similar goals and core values allow them to see eye-to-eye when making key decisions, and their strong characters allow them to be critical of each other\u2019s ideas when absolutely necessary. His younger brother\u2019s presence as the company\u2019s Operations Manager is another indication that friends and family can be ideal business partners, if they share the drive and dedication needed to promote the success of the business. \u201cAustin and Jim are the absolute ideal people to do this with, if you can get past the big hurdle of the old adage mates, family and business don\u2019t mix. I believe we have been an acceptation to this notion.\u201d<br />\nChallenges can be frequent in any industry, even in the air of success. But Maggs\u2019 path to where he is today can be viewed as an example of how determination can overcome any obstacles along the way. \u201cIf you have a look at where I\u2019ve come from \u2013 being an apprentice residential carpenter, to now having a business that offers everything from design of subdivisions to shop fitting; has 50 employees; has a turnover of $40 million a year \u2013 there\u2019s a pathway if you want to apply yourself to start as a tradie and ultimately own and run a large scale construction company.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au/bdm-constructions/\">BDM Constructions</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://abns.com.au\">Australian Business News Source</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://abns.com.au/bdm-constructions/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
