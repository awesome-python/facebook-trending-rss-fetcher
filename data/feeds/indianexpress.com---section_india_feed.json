Lok Sabha does not have this benefit.</p>\n<p>Expressing gratitude to the retiring members, he said\u00a0the 53 members in their six-year tenure have seen two\u00a0governments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Both governments benefited from their knowledge and\u00a0experience. This government benefited less, the previous one\u00a0benefited more,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The nation has benefited from their Parliamentary\u00a0contributions, he said.</p>\n<p>Speaking after Modi, Congress leader Anand Sharma\u00a0noted that while the House had cleared important legislations\u00a0like Bangladesh land boundary agreement, insurance bill that\u00a0had been pending for seven years and the insolvency bill, it\u00a0was true that there was delay in some.</p>\n<p>He blamed ideological differences for it, saying they\u00a0had led to stalling of the GST bill for years when the UPA was\u00a0in power.</p>\n<p>UPA had piloted the GST bill but <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>-ruled states like\u00a0Gujarat had opposed the draft.</p>\n<p>A wrong image was created outside that no work is\u00a0transacted in Rajya Sabha, he said, adding obstructions are\u00a0part of democracy and are used to put across reservations on\u00a0policies and programmes.</p>\n<p>He, however, regretted the &#8220;bitterness&#8221; in political\u00a0discourse saying debate and discussion are part of India&#8217;s\u00a0rich democratic legacy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One has to be able to listen to dissenting voices\u00a0without taking them personally but as ideological<br />\ndifferences,&#8221;

surprised many observers as the PLA in this year&#8217;s reform brought most of the provincial military commands under the control of Central Military Commission&#8217;s (CMC) new National Defence Mobilisation Department.\n<p>In a surprise move, China has elevated the rank of Tibet&#8217;s Military Command which looks after the security along its border with India by putting it under the jurisdiction of PLA ground forces, suggesting it may &#8220;undertake some kind of military combat mission in future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;China raises Tibet Military Command&#8217;s (TMC) power rank,&#8221; state-run Global Times said in a front page report.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The TMC&#8217;s political rank will be elevated to one level higher than its counterpart provincial-level military commands and will come under the leadership of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA),&#8221; it reported citing another official newspaper the &#8216;China Youth Daily.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The promotion marks a new journey for the TMC command&#8217;s construction,&#8221; it said.</p>\n<p>The sudden &#8220;elevation&#8221; surprised many observers as the PLA in this year&#8217;s reform brought most of the provincial military commands under the control of Central Military Commission&#8217;s (CMC) new National Defence Mobilisation Department.</p>\n<p>[Related-post]</p>\n<p>CMC, the overall high command of the PLA, is directly headed by President Xi Jinping, who is also the head of the ruling Communist Party.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The TMC on the other hand, is under the leadership of the Chinese ground forces, which suggests that the command may undertake some kind of military combat mission in the future,&#8221; the report quoted a &#8220;source close to the matter&#8221; as saying.</p>\n<p>There was no elaboration of what the &#8220;military combat mission&#8221; will be.</p>\n<p>Seasoned military observers termed the report confusing.</p>\n<p>Until last year, China had seven military area commands in Beijing, Nanjing, Chengdu, Jinan, Shenyang, Lanzhou and Guangzhou. Of this Chengdu looked after security of India&#8217;s Eastern sector in the Tibet region including Arunachal Pradesh while Lanzhou in Xinjiang looked after partly the western sector, including <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/\">Kashmir</a> region and Pakistan.</p>\n<p>As per the new strategic zone plan, both Chengdu and Lanzhou gets integrated into strategic command region making it perhaps the biggest areas for Chinese military.</p>\n<p>TMC may perhaps get a four-star General instead of a Lt General, while Lanzhou, where the combat forces are stationed is already led by a General.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Loosely put it, the report is very confusing. we need to more information to get a proper perspective,&#8221; a senior military official told PTI.</p>\n<p>India-China borders largely enjoy peace and tranquillity, not withstanding the dispute over the 3,488-km long border.</p>\n<p>They have set up mechanism at the ground and at the level of the government to address issues relating to the recurring transgressions by PLA troops in the areas claimed by India.</p>\n<p>The issue was broadly discussed during last month&#8217;s visit of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar to China during which the two sides agreed to set up &#8216;Hot Lines&#8217; between the militaries.</p>\n<p>President Pranab Mukherjee is due to visit China on a state visit from May 24 to improve bilateral ties. However, differences have arisen between the two over China&#8217;s attempts to block India&#8217;s bid to ban Pakistan-based militant leaders.</p>\n<p>China is also stepping its investment in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), through which it is building USD 46 billion economic corridor.</p>\n<p>By raising TMC&#8217;s authority level and putting it under the jurisdiction of PLA ground forces, China continues to boost its military presence in Tibet and aims to allow the military command to shoulder more combat assignments, analysts said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The elevation of the authority level is not only an improvement for the troops&#8217; designation, but also an expansion of their function and mission,&#8221; Zhao Zhong, deputy director of the Political Work Department of the TMC, was quoted as saying by China Youth Daily.</p>\n<p>Military commands in Tibet and Xinjiang have always enjoyed special political status and the promotion in rank this time reflects a continuation of China&#8217;s policy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The promotion shows China is paying great attention to the TMC, which will significantly improve the command&#8217;s ability to manage and control the region&#8217;s military resources, as well as provide better preparation for combat,&#8221; Song Zhongping, a Beijing-based military expert said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the TMC is under the leadership of Western Theatre Command, headquartered in Chengdu, Sichuan Province.</p>\n<p>Parrikar visited it during his visit last month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After the military reform, the TMC&#8217;s priority is the management of military resources, as well as the region&#8217;s national defence mobilisation,&#8221; Song said.</p>\n<p>The TMC bears great responsibility to prepare for possible China-India conflicts, and currently it is difficult to secure all the military resources they need, Song said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Border disputes between China and India have not been completely resolved. Military action in the TMC requires specialist mountain skills and long-range capabilities, which need the deployment of special military resources,&#8221; Song said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The promotion of the command&#8217;s authority level shows the amount of attention China places on the defence of its southwestern borders,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The report quoted a Beijing-based military expert saying that &#8220;as a key part of the Western Theatre Command, the elevation in rank of TMC will also boost combat abilities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Early this year, Xi revamped the 2.3 million strong military by creating a PLA Rocket Force of the strategic missile forces and the Strategic Support Force to provide proper electronic and cyber intelligence backup for precision missiles strikes.</p>\n<p>The unified joint command system which Xi initiated will end the army-dominated set-up with more role for airforce and navy, which are on a modernisation drive under an annual USD 145 defence budget.</p>\n<p>The overhaul is aimed at moving away from an army-centric system towards a Western-style joint command in which the army, navy and air force are equally represented.</p><img

the criminal defamation law.\n<p>The Supreme Court Friday upheld the constitutional validity of the penal provisions of criminal defamation law, underlining the right to free speech cannot undermine

Code that stipulated punishment for defamation.</p>\n<p>While ratifying the validity of criminal defamation law, the bench said that magistrates should however be extra careful in issuing summons in

India&#8217;s intervention in 1987 to solve a separatist insurgency led to the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by a rebel suicide bomber. India also lost hundreds of its peacekeeping forces sent to teardrop-shaped island.</p>\n<p>Ties have warmed recently. Sirisena chose India for his first state visit after being elected early last year. Soon after, Modi became the first Indian prime minister to make a bilateral visit to Sri Lanka in 28 years.</p>\n<p>Sirisena&#8217;s government also suspended the Chinese port project championed by his predecessor, strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had a heavy pro-China leaning. At the time, Sirisena&#8217;s government said there was a lack of proper study on the environmental impact of building a city _ with a golf course, marinas, apartments and shopping malls _ on an artificial island just outside the port of Colombo.</p>\n<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping had launched the project during a visit to the island in 2013. Sri Lanka&#8217;s decision to restart the project was seen a way of reassuring China while simultaneously growing closer to India. Sri Lanka is also likely to court more Chinese investment to resuscitate an ailing economy burdened by heavy debt.</p>\n<p>Sri Lankan officials have said changes were made to the original plan to minimise environmental impact, but have not made that assessment public. They also scrapped a controversial plan to give outright land ownership to China, saying they would instead offer the land on a 99-year lease.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>India had expressed concern over the project, which would allow a heavy Chinese presence in a country geographically set apart from India only by the narrow Palk Strait.</p>\n<p>Sirisena&#8217;s visit also comes at a time of heavy opposition in Sri Lanka to a proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement, which critics say could allow unemployed Indians to flood Sri Lankan professions such as information technology and health sectors.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2798049&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sri-lankan-president-maithripala-sirisena-to-visit-india-in-delicate-balancing-act-2798049/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/04/maithripala-sirisena-m.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/04/maithripala-sirisena-m.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Maithripala-Sirisena-m</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/582c8bb064bbcdb31f96742998c669de?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shreyasijha22</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/maithripala-sirisena-l.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Maithripala Sirisena, Sri Lanka President, Sri Lanka, President Maithripala Sirisena, Sirisena, Maithripala Sirisena india , Maithripala Sirisena india visit, Sri Lanka India, India sri Lanka ties, Maithripala Sirisena in India, Narendra Modi, Pm Modi, Si Lankan government, Sirisena government, Kumbh Mela, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lankan PM Ranil Wickremesinghe, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Xi Jinping, india news, indian express news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>As Sushma responds to US mother\u2019s tweet, daughter gets medical aid in Dehradun jail</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sushma-swaraj-tweets-us-citizen-colette-smith-in-dehradun-jail-gets-aid-2798016/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sushma-swaraj-tweets-us-citizen-colette-smith-in-dehradun-jail-gets-aid-2798016/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 07:54:39 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 07:56:39 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Devyani Onial]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2798016</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Colette Smith\u2019s friends said she has a host of medical issues and her health has been deteriorating in prison.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2798016&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2798019 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/american-dehradun-jail-759.jpg\" alt=\"Sushma Swaraj, Sushma Swaraj tweets, Colette Smith, Dehradun jail, US citizen in Dehradun jail, Colette Smith Dehradun Jail, India news\" /> Smith was arrested from IGI Airport in Delhi in Jan 2015\n<p>It was a tweet from a mother in the United States that drew attention to the case on Wednesday. \u201c@SushmaSwaraj Colette Smith, US citizen &#8211; Dehradun prison &#8211; 17 months.

I will ensure that your daughter gets immediate medical help.\u201d</p>\n<p>On Thursday, jail authorities said Colette Smith was taken for a check-up to the Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences at Jolly Grant. \u201cShe has been receiving treatment at Jolly Grant, AIIMS Rishikesh and even AIIMS Delhi regularly. She has gynaecological problems, urinary tract infection and some psychological problems,\u201d said Jail Superintendent M S Gwal.</p>\n<p>Smith was arrested on January 14, 2015 from the Indira Gandhi International airport at Delhi. While sources at the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) said she was trying to flee the country, her friends claimed she had a return ticket and was planning to come back. A complaint was filed against her and two others by the NCB.</p>\n<p>According to Lav Kumar Singh, who is the investigating officer, they had received information that drugs containing pseudoephedrine, a controlled substance used in medicines for cold and cough, were seized in Manipur from where they were headed across the border. \u201cSome of these were made by Daffohils, a Dehradun-based company. On investigation, we found that this company was not using most of the pseudoephedrine it was acquiring for medicines but was diverting it. Many of the distributors who were named in their records said they never received the medicines from them,\u201d said Singh.</p>\n<p>Smith was the director of Daffohils for a brief period, after it was taken over by her associate Dr Vijay Aggawal in 2012. It has since gone back to its previous owner.</p>\n<p>Smith, with a degree in physical health, also co-founded Bella Health, an NGO in Dehradun that works with women\u2019s health, in 2011 with Agarwal, whom she knew from the US and who had family in Dehradun.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have asked the Enforcement Directorate to investigate that foundation too,\u201d said Singh. There have been a total of six arrests but Agarwal hasn\u2019t responded to summons and has not visited India since, he said.</p>\n<p>Smith\u2019s friends said she has a host of medical issues and her health has been deteriorating in prison. \u201cShe has endometriosis, thyroid and persistent urinary tract infection. She needs specialised care,\u201d said Bani Hoon, who knew Smith because of their association with People for Animals.</p>\n<p>Last July, Smith was granted interim bail for two months on health grounds, but her plea for an extension was rejected.

It is also likely to be a test case for over a dozen ISIS online sympathisers arrested in India after him.</p>\n<p>The court gave its ruling on April 29 after Biswas questioned the move by Bengaluru police to charge him with involvement in cyber terrorism under Section 66 F of the Information Technology Act, 2000 over his alleged ISIS-linked online activity. The charge under this section carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Apart from the cyber terrorism charge, Biswas is to stand trial under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 for advocating terrorism, facilitating recruitment for terrorist activities and for supporting a terrorist organisation, and Indian Penal Code sections on attempt to wage war against India, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/\">sedition</a>, waging war against an Asiatic ally of India, provocation to rioting, and making</p>\n<p>statements amounting to public mischief.</p>\n<p>Biswas contested the framing of cyber terrorism charges saying he had not hacked into a computer system, created a virus or denied access to any computer system as stated in Section 66 F of the IT Act which defines acts of cyber terrorism.</p>\n<p>Advocates for Biswas told the court last month that the youth must be discharged from the case at the stage of the framing of charges itself since police had failed to place sufficient material on record to substantiate the charge of cyber terrorism.</p>\n<p>His advocates also argued that his online activities did not threaten the \u201cunity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India\u2019\u2019 or that it was done with the \u201cintent to strike terror in the people or any section of the people\u2019\u2019 since ISIS was not a banned terrorist organisation in India during his activism.</p>\n<p>The Bengaluru police, on their part, argued that as mandated by law at the stage of framing of charges, a prima facie case of cyber terrorism had been made out against Biswas in a chargesheet and supporting documents, running into 30,000 pages, placed in court.</p>\n<p>Police also placed printed records of some of the pro-ISIS material tweeted by Biswas while he was operating the @shamiwitness Twitter handle between January 25, 2013 and December 11/12 of 2014.</p>\n<p>The prosecution argued that Biswas had tweeted, re-tweeted thousands of ISIS messages and also posted pictures and videos of war to support the terrorist acts of ISIS and thus abetted waging of war \u201cagainst Asiatic powers like Syria, Iraq and Iran, who are in alliance with India\u2019\u2019.</p>\n<p>The prosecution also told the court that Biswas allowed his Twitter account to become a meeting place for ISIS supporters trying to connect to ISIS leaders and to accounts of ISIS individuals already in Syria and Iraq.</p>\n<p>Biswas is alleged to have led online ISIS sympathisers to the official Twitter accounts of ISIS leaders like \u201cSheikh Abu Hafs al Masri\u201d to enable ISIS recruitment and guided Westerners trying to join ISIS by providing specific inputs like details of unguarded border crossings.</p>\n<p>He is alleged to have helped a Western recruit, using the Twitter handle @TalabAlHaqq, to cross into Syria from Turkey by tweeting a message in June 2014 saying \u201c@TalabAlHaqq walaykum salam, Tal Abyad crossing open now\u201d.</p>\n<p>The prosecution also alleged that Biswas supported cession of Jammu and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/\">Kashmir</a> from India through some of his tweets in which he supported terrorists attacking civilians and Indian forces and by calling on Muslims in Kashmir to support the ISIS Caliphate.</p>\n<p>One of the prosecution arguments that the court took into consideration while judging that there is a prima facie case for framing charges of cyber terrorism against Biswas is the argument that though ISIS was not banned by the Indian government at the time of his arrest, a UN document had equated ISIS with the already banned al-Qaeda.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs such it is to be presumed that ISIS was a terrorist organisation banned by the UN and an organisation listed in the Schedule of UAP Act at Sl. No. 28 and Sl. No. 33 even as on 25.1.2013. In that event, there is reasonable ground to believe that the accused was fully aware that ISIS was a terrorist organisation,\u2019\u2019 the court observed in its order.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe materials on record prima facie indicate that the accused had intention to threaten the unity, integrity, security and sovereignty of India as well as to strike terror in a section of the people, particularly in Kashmir,\u2019\u2019 the court said.</p>\n<p>The start of his trial is expected next month.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2798009&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-engineer-to-stand-trial-for-isis-terror-online-2798009/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bengal-isis-biswas-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bengal-isis-biswas-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Bengal-ISIS-BISWAS-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/bengal-isis-biswas-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">islamic state, islamic state india, india isis, isis, inda isis arrest, isis india arrest, india news, islamic state news, bengal isis arrest, bengal news, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Over 83 per cent vote in HCBA polls, results today</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/over-83-per-cent-vote-in-hcba-polls-results-2797837/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/over-83-per-cent-vote-in-hcba-polls-results-2797837/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 07:20:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 07:20:56 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797837</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Out of a total of 4,495 eligible voters, as many as 3,736 cast their votes.

Click for story\n<p>The Maharashtra ATS, which had earlier filed a chargesheet in the case, named 14 people as accused including Thakur and Purohit.</p>\n<p>Sources said the decision not to charge Thakur, a former office-bearer of the ABVP, was taken because of the \u201cweak evidence\u201d against her and the fact that MCOCA charges had been dropped against the accused.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only material evidence against her was the motorcycle on which the bomb was kept. This motorcycle was in her name but was being used by Ramchandra Kalsangra. Investigations have proved it was with him for two years prior to the blast. He was the one who would get it repaired and pay for its maintenance. Witness statements proved it,\u201d an officer claimed.</p>\n<p>Sources claimed the evidence against Thakur on her participation in the conspiracy was \u201cthin\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is not a single statement recorded before a magistrate (under Section 164 of the CrPC) that says she was part of the conspiracy meetings. All witness statements have been recorded under MCOCA before a DCP (deputy commissioner of police). Once MCOCA charges are dropped, these statements have no evidentiary value. There are just as many statements saying she was not part of the meetings,\u201d another officer said.</p>\n<p>Under MCOCA, a statement recorded before a DCP-rank officer is admissible as evidence in court. A statement recorded under Section 164 of CrPC before a magistrate is also admissible in court.</p>\n<p>The NIA evidence against Purohit, sources said, establish he was an integral part of Abhinav Bharat, the organisation that allegedly plotted the blasts. The probe uncovered a money trail leading to Purohit. Sources said the NIA had found that he used the organisation\u2019s money to buy plots in Nashik.</p>\n<p>The NIA will also list evidence in the form of phone intercepts. In one such intercept, he is allegedly telling the other accused to flee and destroy evidence since police had got whiff of their involvement. The agency matched his voice sample with that in the intercept.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are several statements, recorded before a magistrate, which say he was part of conspiracy meetings. Against him, we have good evidence,\u201d an NIA officer said.</p>\n<p>The decision to drop MCOCA charges against the accused was taken since the application itself was flawed, NIA sources claimed. Sources said only one accused, Rakesh Dhawde, qualified to be charged under the law which requires that the accused must have at least two chargesheets against him, and proof that the crime was committed for pecuniary gains.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll others were charged for association. Even the two chargesheets against Dhawde were an afterthought. He was arrested in November 2008 for his involvement in the 2003 Parbhani blast and 2004 Jalna blast. The day after his arrest, he was chargesheeted. This was used as justification for slapping MCOCA,\u201d the officer said.</p>\n<p>The NIA had earlier sought the opinion of the Law Ministry whether MCOCA charges could be dropped. The Ministry asked the agency to apply its own mind on the available evidence.</p>\n<p>The NIA, which took over the case almost three years after the Maharashtra ATS filed a chargesheet in the case, re-examined all the accused, witnesses and evidence presented in the ATS chargesheet. It also recorded fresh statements, many of which exonerated the accused.</p>\n<p><strong>What ATS had on Sadhvi, Purohit</strong><br />\n<em>* Hero Honda motorcycle with bombs was owned by Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur.</em><br />\n<em> * She was the first to be arrested by Maharashtra ATS on October 24, 2008.</em><br />\n<em> * Sadhvi attended most meetings since 2006 on targeting Muslim-majority areas.</em><br />\n<em> * At Bhopal meeting on April 11, 2008, Purohit said he would provide explosives.</em><br />\n<em> * Sadhvi said she would arrange men for the blasts in Malegaon.</em><br />\n<em> * Sadhvi knew Sunil Joshi, Ramchandra Kalsangra.

The idea that people\u2019s sexual orientation is due to the so-called western influence is also incorrect, and a positive image needs to be created for the LGBT community.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chopade added that it was important for members of society to understand that being lesbian, gay, transgender or bisexual is a lifestyle, and not merely a \u2018trend\u2019.

When I went to Peravoor (in Kannur district), people were talking about it and that is how I came to know about the incident. In the newspaper, I saw one of my sons standing with a banana in his hand while my other son was holding a waste bag,\u201d she is heard telling the questioner in the video.</p>\n<p>She also denied that the children were foraging for food. \u201cThey were told to dump waste at a place meant for burning it. That is why one of the boys was shown searching for something in a bag. How can they gather the waste in their hands,\u201d she says. The mother also said that media reports that there were four children at the dump were false. \u201cNo, there were only three. Two are from this house while another is from the neighbouring house. Even if there is nothing to eat at home, we collect a few coconuts from others\u2019 land and sell them to buy rice. We would not send our children to the garbage yard and allow them to eat from the refuse. The newspapers have wrongly claimed that when then fathers go to work, we mothers take the children to the garbage yard,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>The photograph appeared in the local daily Mathrubhumi on November 4, 2015, and was subsequently picked up by local newspapers and TV channels. It showed the children in a garbage yard at Peravoor in Kannur, seemingly foraging for food. Responding to the video, Mathrubhumi reporter Nazer Valiyedathu alleged that it was made by local <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> leaders and that they had forced the mother and son \u201cto give wrong statements before the camera\u201d.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\"><strong>WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</strong></a></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797954&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/offered-bananas-before-photo-boy-in-somalia-jibe-picture-2797954/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bboys-2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bboys-2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">bboys 2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad19eff6049dd5571c755a3dacf699fc?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">namithans</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/bboys-1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">somalia, solamia remark, somalia picture, narendra modi, Pm Modi, Prime minister naredra Modi, Modi In Kerala, Scheduled Tribes, SCs, STs, Scheduled tribes in Kerala, Condition of Schedules tribe children in Kerala, modi somalia statement, kerala somalia comparison, india news, indian express news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Dairy farmers spill 14,000 litres of milk in Odisha stir</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/dairy-farmers-spill-14000-litres-of-milk-in-odisha-stir-2797889/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/dairy-farmers-spill-14000-litres-of-milk-in-odisha-stir-2797889/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 04:47:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 04:47:55 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Debabrata Mohanty]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797889</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The farmers from Bheden and Atabira block of Bargarh district were protesting against Omfed authorities\u2019 refusal to accept their milk on grounds of adulteration.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797889&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2797947\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/milk-1.jpg\" alt=\"A man bathes in the milk, in Bargarh Thursday.

They then stopped an Omfed tanker carrying 6,000 litres to a chilling plant, opened the valve of the tanker and milk flowed onto the road.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/dairy-farmers-spill-14000-litres-of-milk-in-odisha-stir-2797889/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/lower-retail-prices-pay-more-to-milk-producers-state-tells-dairies/\"><span class=\"text\">Lower retail prices, pay more to milk producers: State tells dairies</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/amul-milk-chilling-plant-to-come-up-at-saifai/\"><span class=\"text\">Amul milk chilling plant to come up at Saifai</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/regional/milk-prices-in-odisha-up-by-rs-2/\"><span class=\"text\">Milk prices in Odisha up by Rs 2</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/meet-on-milk-price-hike-soon-ajit-pawar/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2010/12/m_id_190484_ajit_pawar.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Meet on milk price hike soon: Ajit Pawar</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/kutch-coop-milk-union-set-up-to-start-collection-by-diwali/\"><span class=\"text\">Kutch co-op milk union set up,to start collection by Diwali</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/spurious-milk-police-tighten-noose/\"><span class=\"text\">Spurious milk: Police tighten noose</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Omfed CMD Bishnupada Sethi said the farmers had been warned against adulterating milk. \u201cSome farmers were adding caustic soda and sugar to milk before it went to the chilling plant.

We will aim at streamlining the process to sell cattle to other states and proper certificates will be issued clarifying that cattle is being moved for milk or semen, not for slaughtering. At present, there is no transparency and vigilante groups are harassing farmers even when cattle is sold to other states. AAP understands that certain sections have religious values attached to cows and we have intention to hurt them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Asked about how stray cattle will be managed then, he said, \u201cNon-milch and infertile animals will be provided with proper shelters.

These have been forwarded to the ED. We are now waiting for the ED\u2019s reply on them,\u201d a Ministry of External Affairs source said.</p>\n<p>Elaborating on the queries, an ED source said there were other issues, too, regarding differences in law in the two countries and the way evidence is appreciated. \u201cThese things are being discussed,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>According to the CBI and the ED, Michel is among the key accused in the Rs 3,600-crore AgustaWestland chopper deal case. The probe by the two agencies has pointed out that Michel\u2019s companies received around Euro 42 million to facilitate the deal, of which a large part was distributed as bribes.</p>\n<p>The ED believes that the legitimate part of the offset money earmarked for another alleged middleman, Guido Haschke, by AgustaWestland went to IDS India, which was not part of the middlemen maze. The bribe money was allegedly sent to IDS Tunisia, which subsequently sent it to IDS Mauritius. It was IDS Mauritius that allegedly paid bribes to the Tyagi brothers. The ED is now hoping it would get a chance to interrogate Michel to pinpoint who he paid bribes to.</p>\n<p>ED sources said the agency would now try to confirm his location in Dubai independently and get in touch with the UAE in due course. Both agencies have already rejected suggestions by Michel that he be examined remotely. The agencies want Michel to join the probe in India.</p>\n<p>Indian agencies have always found it difficult to get fugitives extradited from the UK. Despite attempts, the CBI has not been able to get naval war room leak case accused Ravi Shankaran from the UK. Its request was rejected by a UK court in April 2014.</p>\n<p>The agency, on a request from the Mumbai Police, had unsuccessfully tried to get underworld don Iqbal Mirchi extradited from the UK way back in 1995. Similarly, India could never get musician Nadeem from there through the extradition route in connection with the Gulshan Kumar murder case. The latest is the case of former IPL chairman <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lalit-modi/\">Lalit Modi</a>, who fled the country in 2010 and has been in the UK ever since.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797884&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agustawestland-uk-finds-flaws-in-indias-request-for-middleman-michels-extradition-2797884/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/agustawestland-deal-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/agustawestland-deal-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">agustawestland-deal-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad19eff6049dd5571c755a3dacf699fc?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">namithans</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/agustawestland_chopper_deal.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">agustawestland, chopper scam, VVIP chopper scam, Christian Michel, vijay mallya, agustawestland middlemen, uk denies mallya deportation, mallya deportation</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Punjab Custodial death: Two cops booked for murder</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/punjab-custodial-death-two-cops-booked-for-murder-2797877/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/punjab-custodial-death-two-cops-booked-for-murder-2797877/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 03:29:39 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 03:30:32 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Raakhi Jagga]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797877</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[38-year-old victim was brought to police station in Barnala after he could not show papers of his motorcycle<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797877&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2797882\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/barnala-custodial-death-protest-759.jpg\" alt=\"custodial death, punjab custodial deaths, barnala custodial deaths, barnala custodial deaths protest, Handayiya police station deaths, punjab news, india news, latest news\" /> Baldev\u2019s family along with Bharti Kisan Union (Ugrahan) and Bharti Kisan Union (Dakaunda) protest outside the civil hospital, Barnala, on Thursday.

They also claimed that Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh\u2019s son was perhaps a beneficiary of the deal.</p>\n<p>They claimed that documents, uploaded on their organisation Swaraj Abhiyan\u2019s website, prove that the state government acquired an AgustaWestland helicopter in 2007 by paying over 30 per cent commission to a dealer, through a tendering process that led to a single vendor situation just as in the VVIP chopper deal. They alleged that barely six months after all the payments were made, two companies with Raman Singh\u2019s son, Abhishek Singh, as director sprung up in tax haven British Virgin Islands (BVI).</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was pretended that the (state) government floated a global tender, while it was (specifically) written in the tender which model was to be purchased.

She has read Roald Dahl as a child, is most struck by Jane Austen now and watches The Big Bang Theory regularly. She topped Lady Shri Ram College, among Delhi University\u2019s most prestigious, and earned the title \u2018Student of the Year\u2019. And this, after she scored 100 per cent in Political Science and History in the Class XII ICSE board exams from Convent of Jesus and Mary.</p>\n<p>A story of \u201cpatience and consistency\u201d, as the newest IAS officer puts it herself.</p>\n<p>But then, this story is also about her mother Himali Kamble\u2019s decision, despite being a qualified electrical engineer, to put her own career on the side and give her daughters the benefit of her \u201ceducation and time&#8230; like a tapasya\u201d.</p>\n<p>The story of Tina Dabi is also one of deep and complex social change in India that has made her the first ever Dalit girl to top the UPSC examination. As <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> MP and ex-civil servant Udit Raj tweeted, this \u201cwould not have been possible 40-50 years ago\u201d.</p>\n<p>Tina\u2019s parents, both from the Engineering Services, do not speak much about this but are not in denial of the enormity of the achievement, either. They are clear that it is the enabling environment created over years, through generations of struggle and grit, that made a Tina Dabi possible.</p>\n<p><b><div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/tina-dabi-upsc-topper-upsc-civil-services-examination-2797804/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/upsc-topper-ias-upsc-result-tina-dabi-2797573/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/04/tina.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Not Without Reservations</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/upsc-delhi-topper-result-haryana-cadre-like-tina-2795754/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/tina-dabi-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Like Tina</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/education/tina-dabi-upsc-topper-from-delhi-picks-big-paradox-haryana-as-cadre-2794414/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/tina-dabi-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">UPSC results: 22-year-old topper Tina Dabi picks \u2018big paradox\u2019 Haryana as cadre</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/upsc-athar-aamir-ul-shafi-khan-success-stories-from-militancy-hit-valley-india-gets-an-inspiration-2794329/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/upsc-topper-athar-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">UPSC success story: From militancy-hit Valley, India gets an inspiration</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/education/upsc-civil-services-examination-results-2015-declared-delhi-girl-tops-list/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/09/upsc-m.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">UPSC Civil Services Examination results 2015 declared, Delhi girl tops list</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/education/delhi-woman-tina-dabi-tops-civil-services-exam-jk-boy-athar-aamir-ul-shafi-khan-gets-second-rank-2793786/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/tina-dabi-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Delhi&#039;s Tina Dabi tops UPSC exam, J-K boy gets second rank</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</b></p>\n<p>\u201cI realise what a big and prestigious examination the IAS is. We have had a string of engineers in the family but she will be the first IAS,\u201d said Jaswant Dabi, Tina\u2019s father.</p>\n<p>Jaswant\u2019s roots lie in Rajasthan\u2019s Dabi village and he recalls how his grandfather struggled to make a life for his children. Today, Tina\u2019s father is one among several engineers in the family \u2014 his father is one, his brother, too. His \u201csister is an educationist and a younger brother in the Merchant Navy.\u201d Based in Jaipur now, his father Nand Kishore Dabi worked with the CSIR in Pilani.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe real struggle was waged by my father and grandfather who was in the military and left it soon. My father taught in order to be able to study and make money to fund my education. We have never forgotten all that,\u201d said Jaswant.</p>\n<p>Tina\u2019s parents met through common friends and got married in 1989, with the rituals involving their home states of Rajasthan and Maharashtra. Tina was born in Bhopal, where her parents were posted then, and studied there till Class 7 before moving to Delhi with the family in 2005.</p>\n<p>Is Tina aware of how this is a moment of phenomenal achievement for others in her community? Her passion, she replies, is gender. She argues how \u201cthe world over, it is gender which is the glass ceiling, and therefore I decided I would work in Haryana\u201d.</p>\n<p>At their home in New Delhi, Tina\u2019s paintings done in Madhubani style stand as a tribute to their time in Bhopal, when her mother would take her to exhibitions. Himali would insist that her daughters Tina and the younger Ria buy craftwork worth \u201cat least Rs 10-15\u201d to help craftspersons and connect with them.</p>\n<p>So was there any pressure from Himali for Tina to be like that character from the movie \u20183 Idiots\u2019 and choose medicine or engineering? Tina laughs and talks of how her mother \u201crecognised that I would be able to do much more in Humanities\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter two months of science in class XI, she urged that I move. Many people thought it was a strange thing to do, but I could do so much more and I think Humanities has made me a much more wholesome person,\u201d said Tina.</p>\n<p>Himali has no contact with her family\u2019s ancestral village Pulgaon, near Nagpur, but says Tina is not the first topper in the family \u2014 her father Purshottam Madhavrao Kamble, too, had topped school.</p>\n<p>Both her father and grandfather, \u201cfound the story of Babasaheb (Ambedkar) deeply inspiring\u201d, says Himali.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy father was thankful that we did not have to face any exacting circumstances, as my grandfather was a station master and my grandmother did everything to push all our siblings to work, study and defy our circumstances. I always remember their struggle and remember to be humble despite the success over generations,\u201d said Himali.</p>\n<p>Other senior Dalit officers, too, are conscious of the \u201chistory of the moment\u201d even if it is being celebrated only in hushed tones on WhatsApp groups \u2014 no one sure of how openly it should be marked.</p>\n<p>P S Krishnan, an ex-IAS officer and an activist on issues of discrimination and exclusion, says the message about brilliant people from discriminated backgrounds shining on pure \u201cmerit\u201d is \u201cnot anti-quota\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes clear what removing obstacles and taking away roadblocks and difficulties can do. Cases like these inspire a lot as they are a testament to how meritorious deprived communities can be, and their innate talent shines and cuts through all issues&#8230; a sign of great success and possibility for Dalits struggling to break free of their circumstances,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797804&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/tina-dabi-upsc-topper-upsc-civil-services-examination-2797804/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/tina-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/tina-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">tina-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b79f669bb80e3de68460b2235b5e7285?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">maneeshkarki</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/tina.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">UPSC, upsc topper, Tina Dabi, Delhi girl, Delhi girl tops UPSC, civil services exam, 2015 UPSC, upsc.gov.in, upsc ias topper, UPSC Result, UPSC Final result, UPSC Final result 2016, UPSC Toppers, UPSC Toppers list, UPSC Civil Services Examination, UPSC Civil Services Examination Toppers, Civil Services Examination 2015, Civil Services Exam 2015, Civil Services Exam 2015 result, Tina Dabi, Athar Aamir Ul Shafi Khan, IAS exam 2015 result, IAS result, Civil Sevices final result</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>CM Rawat meets Sonia, ducks question on holding early polls</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/cm-rawat-meets-sonia-ducks-question-on-holding-early-polls/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/cm-rawat-meets-sonia-ducks-question-on-holding-early-polls/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 02:56:26 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 02:56:26 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797822</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[He also made it clear that there was no scope for rapprochement with the rebels who had joined hands with the BJP. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797822&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2797824\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/rawat-1.jpg\" alt=\"Uttaranchal CM Harish Rawat with his close aides leave the residence of the Congress President Sonia Gandhi after meeting her in the capital New Delhi on thursday.

the involvement of the senior officer in the case.</p>\n<p>\u201cStealing the affection of brother officer\u2019s wife\u201d is a serious offence under the Army Act Section 69, to be read in conjunction with Section 497 of the IPC, and is punishable by five years of rigorous imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Significantly, the presiding officer of the inquiry, Brig NK Dabas, was removed when the inquiry was still in progress and some senior officers were expected to be summoned as witnesses.</p>\n<p>The complainant Colonel, who was commanding an infantry battalion in Jammu and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/\">Kashmir</a>, had made a complaint through a demi-official letter, dated August 13, 2015, addressed to the then Brigade Commander with a copy to General Officer Commanding 19 Infantry Division, General Officer Commanding 15 Corps, Director General National Cadet Corps, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command, Chief of Army Staff General Dalbir Singh and Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.</p>\n<p>In this letter, he had alleged that another officer of the rank of Colonel, who was from his battalion and under whom he had served for several years and was now posted in NCC, had been sending sexually explicit messages to his wife and that he believed both were in an illicit relationship.</p>\n<p>Based on the complaint, a Court of Inquiry was ordered vide Headquarters Delhi Area in 2015.</p>\n<p>The Court of Inquiry found that both the Colonels were from the same battalion, which the complainant had joined in 1999 while the accused officer was the adjutant of the unit. Since then, they had served together in<br />\nmany locations, including Chandimandir.</p>\n<p>The inquiry noted that the complainant Colonel had synchronised the mobile number of his wife with his laptop, and after seeing the messages being exchanged by his wife and the accused Colonel, it became clear to him that the two were having an extramarital affair.</p>\n<p>Noting that in all cases where such allegations were made it was impossible to get an eyewitness or conclusive evidence, the Court of Inquiry analysed all available circumstantial and technical evidence.</p>\n<p>One of the clinching pieces of evidence cited by the inquiry was that the wife of the complainant sent an SMS to her friend in December 2014 stating that she was \u201cwaiting for January 4, 2015, imagine a wife waiting for her husband to leave\u201d.</p>\n<p>The Court of Inquiry said it found it \u201cuncommon for any normal Army wife to have such feelings for her husband, especially while he was posted at high-risk counter insurgency infested operational area where he might have lost his life or limb\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797755&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/army-probe-uses-technical-proof-to-nail-colonel-in-affair-case-2797755/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/07/mobile-tower3.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/07/mobile-tower3.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">mobile-tower</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad19eff6049dd5571c755a3dacf699fc?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">namithans</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>PMO directs ASI to acquire land at Masoul to resume excavation</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pmo-directs-asi-to-acquire-land-at-masoul-to-resume-excavation-2797756/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pmo-directs-asi-to-acquire-land-at-masoul-to-resume-excavation-2797756/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:58:58 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:58:58 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jagdeep Singh Deep]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797756</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[ASI writes to dist administration, seeks land records<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797756&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2797761 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/masoul-village-fossil-759.jpg\" alt=\"Masoul village, masoul village fossils, masoul village fossil excavation, pmo masoul village excavation, chandigarh govr museum, india news, chandigarh news latest news\" /> Fossils found from Masoul village, at Govt Museum Art Gallery in Sector 10, Chandigarh.

The fossils were among the oldest in the world; these could be an attraction for many archaeologists across the world. The PMO has directed the department to send a report of progress made so far,\u201d added the official.</p>\n<p>When contacted, Deputy Superintendent (Archaeology) V S Rawat said that they had written a letter to the Mohali Deputy Commissioner and requested him to send the land records so that the process of acquiring the land could be started. But they were still waiting for a reply from the Mohali administration.</p>\n<p>The land, Rawat said, where the excavation was done is private and they cannot carry out the work as landowners can challenge it. The department wants to acquire the land but they came to know that the district administration is finding it tough to gather the land records of the village as it is surrounded by two rivers and forests.</p>\n<p>District Forest Officer Tejinder Singh Saini said that the archaeological department had approached them for seeking clearance for carrying out further activities. They would give the go-ahead once the department acquired land with the permission of the district administration.</p>\n<p>Research was conducted in the village by India-based Society for Archaeological and Anthropological Research (SAAR) and France\u2019s National Scientific Research Centre (CNRS) and department of prehistory of the National Museum of Natural History. The research teams found fossils of fauna which were said to be dating back to 2.6 million years and claimed them to be the oldest fossils. The discovery comprised 1,500 fossil finds over a period of seven years. Before these fossils, the oldest fossils were found in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia which are said to be 2.58 million years old.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797756&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pmo-directs-asi-to-acquire-land-at-masoul-to-resume-excavation-2797756/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/masoul-village-fossil-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/masoul-village-fossil-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Masoul village fossil 480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4585c93d1d73bd036325c17018cff5da?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">dshreya</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/masoul-village-fossil-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Masoul village, masoul village fossils, masoul village fossil excavation, pmo masoul village excavation, chandigarh govr museum, india news, chandigarh news latest news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Why Janu, Kerala\u2019s tribal face, isn\u2019t talking \u2018land\u2019 in Wayanad</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/why-janu-keralas-tribal-face-isnt-talking-land-in-wayanad-2797744/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/why-janu-keralas-tribal-face-isnt-talking-land-in-wayanad-2797744/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:50:01 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 05:21:28 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Shaju Philip]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797744</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Janu was born to a family of Adiyas, an extremely backward tribal group whose members once worked as bonded labourers. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797744&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2797750\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/janu-1.jpg\" alt=\"Vote for change, says Janu \" /> Vote for change, says Janu\n<p>\u201cI am not making any new promises,\u201d says C K Janu, 46, the face of some of the biggest tribal agitations in Kerala in recent years. She is contesting from the hill district of Wayanad as a candidate of the Janathipathya Rashtriya Sabha, a party she founded before the polls. It is now an ally of the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>-led NDA combine.</p>\n<p>Janu says she knows what it is to live with unfulfilled promises. \u201cSuccessive governments have made promises to the tribal community, only to break them. So it makes no sense to make new promises. I am asking people to vote for change,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Janu was born to a family of Adiyas, an extremely backward tribal group whose members once worked as bonded labourers. She worked as a domestic help and a farm hand before joining the Kerala State Karshaka Thozhilali Union, a farm labourers\u2019 organisation affiliated to the CPM. But she quit in protest against the Communist party\u2019s alleged failure to take up tribal issues. The literacy drive in Kerala of the 1980s transformed the unlettered young woman into a leader. She attended classes and mastered Malayalam. Her oratory appealed to the tribals as she took up their causes.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/why-janu-keralas-tribal-face-isnt-talking-land-in-wayanad-2797744/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-elections-2016-popular-tribal-leader-c-k-janu-warms-up-to-bjp-in-kerala/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/kerala-small.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Popular tribal leader C K Janu warms up to BJP in Kerala</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/suspected-maoist-attack-on-stone-quarrying-unit-in-kannur-distirct-of-kerala/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maoist-thumb.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Suspected Maoist attack on stone quarrying unit in Kannur distirct of Kerala</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/between-dish-tv-and-death/\"><span class=\"text\">Between dish TV and death</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/thane-tribal-girls-film-wins-award-in-new-york/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2012/08/m_id_308662_thane_tribal_girls.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Thane tribal girl&#039;s film wins award in New York</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/when-the-stories-of-a-nun-and-a-prostitute-met-on-a-single-stage/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2011/12/m_id_255434_authors_at_the_function.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">When the stories of a nun and a prostitute met on a single stage</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/kerala-tea-estate-turns-a-new-leaf-with-midday-meal-scheme/\"><span class=\"text\">Kerala tea estate turns a new leaf with mid-day meal scheme</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Janu shot to prominence in 2003, when she, along with tribal leader M Geethanandan and hundreds of their supporters, occupied vacant forest land at Muthanga wildlife sanctuary in Wayanad, in protest against the government\u2019s failure to allot agricultural land to tribals. The agitation turned violent, leading to the death of a policeman and a tribal.</p>\n<p>In Wayanad, land is a touchy issue among tribals and settler-farmers, with the former accusing the latter of encroaching on their land over the years. It was her fight to give tribals a right to their land that shaped Janu as a leader. Which is why, her silence on land issues this election is telling. Instead, in her campaign speeches, Janu talks about the \u201cneed for change\u201d from the region\u2019s bipolar politics.</p>\n<p>Of the district\u2019s 2.10 lakh voters, about 53,700-odd are tribals. In this constituency reserved for STs, Janu will be up against <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>\u2019s sitting legislator I C Balakrishnan and CPM\u2019s Rukmini Subramanian. While Janu belongs to the backward farm-worker community of Adiya, Balakrishnan is a member of Kurichiya, a socially and economically progressive tribal group. Subramanian is a Kuruma, another forward tribal community.</p>\n<p>Janu needs no introduction in Wayanad. Her candidature has enthused tribal colonies, with the men at Pakyam and Chethalayam volunteering to accompany her on door-to-door campaigns. \u201cHer presence has served as a morale booster for the community. However, the tribal votes will be divided among the Congress, BJP and CPM,\u201d says E B Ragesh, an engineering graduate at Kattunaika tribal colony. To buttress his point, Ragesh points to his neighbour Unni, a school dropout, who is busy preparing election slips for the CPM candidate.</p>\n<p>Janu\u2019s decision to join the NDA fold, however, has made several of her fellow activists suspicious, with M Geethanandan, her close aide who was arrested during the Muthanga agitation of 2003, disassociating himself from her politics. \u201cIt is true that her candidature has energised the tribals in Wayanad, but her decision to join hands with the BJP has alienated groups that have been fighting for the tribal cause. By bringing Janu into its fold, BJP may have succeeded in weakening tribal sentiments against mainstream parties,\u2019\u2019 says Geethanandan.</p>\n<p>While many saw her induction as a coup by the BJP, which has been struggling with its anti-SC/ST image at the national level, her supporters now say that the party hasn\u2019t pitched in enough. Though local BJP leaders and Ezhava party Bharat Dharma Jana Sena occasionally campaign for her, no senior BJP leader has turned up in Wayanad, except for a rally that Union Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/smriti-irani/\">Smriti Irani</a> held in Sulthan Bathery, the main town in the district. Unlike other NDA candidates, Janu was not invited to share the dais with Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> when he held his election rally at nearby Kasargod.</p>\n<p>Many landless tribals are also sceptical of Janu\u2019s political move. \u201cThere is an impression that she abandoned the tribals for her political ambition. She took us for the Muthanga land agitation in 2003. But what have we got? We are still waiting for land to be allotted. The Congress government has at least given us free rice,\u2019\u2019 says V Balan, a villager\u00a0at Irulam in Wayanad.</p>\n<p>That makes it a difficult battle for Janu. The tribals are divided while the settler-farmers are suspicious about voting for a woman who has led many a agitation to get them evicted. In 2014, Janu had staged a \u2018Nilpusamaram\u2019, where ST demonstrators stood outside the Thiruvananthapuram secretariat for 162 days demanding Panchayat Extension to the Scheduled Area (PESA), under which Adivasis can have their own panchayats. While the government eventually gave in, the promised PESA is still to be implemented. But it\u2019s something the settler-farmers of Wayanad fear. Some in villages in Pulpally and Mullankolly panchayats openly say they will not support Janu. She dismisses these fears. \u201cOrdinary farmers have little to worry from PESA,\u2019\u2019 she says.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797744&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/why-janu-keralas-tribal-face-isnt-talking-land-in-wayanad-2797744/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/janu-2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/janu-2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Janu 2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad19eff6049dd5571c755a3dacf699fc?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">namithans</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/janu-1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Vote for change, says Janu </media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Akhilesh govt scraps its rule, goes back to what RTE Act says</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttar-pradesh-akhilesh-govt-scraps-its-rule-goes-back-to-what-rte-act-says-2797739/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttar-pradesh-akhilesh-govt-scraps-its-rule-goes-back-to-what-rte-act-says-2797739/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:46:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:47:15 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Maulshree Seth]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797739</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[This proposal would be given to the respective district magistrates whose decision would then be informed to the respective school as well as the parents.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797739&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2797742 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/school759.jpg\" alt=\"uttar pradesh, up school, akhilesh government, right to education, rte act, up rte act, up ews provision, allahabad high ews provision, up ews implementation, education news, uttar pradesh news, latest news\" /> As per the order dated May 11, 2016, a Basic Shiksha Adhikari will now be required to ensure admission of EWS students in the neighbouring private schools up to 25 per cent of that school\u2019s total strength, the limit set under the RTE Act.

While BSAs have been asked to follow the instruction, we have decided to study the Delhi model as well,\u201d said Ajay Kumar Singh, secretary, Basic Education Department.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797739&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttar-pradesh-akhilesh-govt-scraps-its-rule-goes-back-to-what-rte-act-says-2797739/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/school480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/school480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">school480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4585c93d1d73bd036325c17018cff5da?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">dshreya</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/school759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">uttar pradesh, up school, akhilesh government, right to education, rte act, up rte act, up ews provision, allahabad high ews provision, up ews implementation, education news, uttar pradesh news, latest news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Chandy wants PM to retract &#8216;Somalia&#8217; remark, says may move EC</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/chandy-wants-pm-to-retract-somalia-remark-says-may-move-ec-2797735/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/chandy-wants-pm-to-retract-somalia-remark-says-may-move-ec-2797735/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:44:37 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:44:37 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797735</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Chandy had earlier written a hard-hitting letter to the Prime Minister and requested him to show some \u2018political decency\u2019 by withdrawing the statement <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797735&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2788954\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/oommen-chandy-759.jpg\" alt=\"Oommen Chandy\" /> Oommen Chandy\n<p>THE CONTROVERSY over the Prime Minister\u2019s remarks likening Kerala to Somalia refused to die down on Thursday, with Chief Minister Oommen Chandy stating that the state government was mulling moving the Election Commission and taking legal action against Modi.

The man himself stands at the middle of a square surrounded by banners and cutouts of him and father M Karunanidhi, with any other DMK signs virtually absent.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/battling-ahead-a-general-in-waiting-in-tamil-nadu-2797721/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-2016-alagiri-stalin-karunanidhi-dmk-2796040/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/alagiri-small.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">DMK doesn\u2019t know how to use me...won\u2019t vote this time: MK Alagiri</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/stalin-hurls-letter-at-cm-panneerselvam-gets-one-from-ramadoss/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/stalin-small.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Stalin hurls letter at CM Panneerselvam, gets one from Ramadoss</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/modi-government-switching-to-capitalist-economy-dmk-leader-m-k-stalin/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/11/modi-t8.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Narendra Modi government drifiting from mixed economy to capitalist economy: M K Stalin</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/dmks-rout-in-polls-m-k-stalin-resigns-and-then-withdraws/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/stalin_karuna_209.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">DMK rout in Tamil Nadu: M K Stalin resigns and then withdraws </span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/the-man-who-wants-to-be-boss/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/09/m_id_415344_vijay.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">The Man Who Wants to be Boss</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/latest-news/tamil-nadu-karuna-appoints-stalin-as-deputy-cm/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2009/05/m_id_83291_stalin.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Tamil Nadu: Karuna appoints Stalin as Deputy CM</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>In a party with a long and bitter fight for succession, this is a decisive new phase. Says a close aide, \u201cAlthough Stalin respects his father\u2019s supremacy, he controls the party now. Almost all the district-level functionaries including those in Madurai are with him.\u201d Madurai was the stronghold of the other son, M K Alagiri, who has receded into the background in this election.</p>\n<p>As part of the image rebuilding, Stalin has shed the usual white shirt and veshti of Tamil leaders, and is seen in colourful shirts and T-shirts, jeans, even track pants and sports shoes. There have been casual walks around villages, careful cradling of babies, tea at roadside shops, travels on autorickshaws and cycles, mingling with bus drivers, and even a symbolic session under a banyan tree listening to people\u2019s problems.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Stalin sprang another surprise, visiting Tirukotiyur Narayana temple at Thiruppathur in Sivaganga district. Since the DMK swears by atheism, Stalin explained that he came to the temple only to see the inscriptions of Vaishnava saint Ramanujar.</p>\n<p>Stalin also stands out from the field for being the rare DMK/AIADMK stalwart facing no major charges.</p>\n<p>Arumugam, a 55-year-old supporter who has come 80 km for the Vellore rally, wishes Stalin had been declared the CM candidate. Wondering whether the omission wouldn\u2019t hurt the DMK, he says, \u201cHad it been the son of any other political leader, he would have captured power long back. But Thalapathi is not even demanding the CM post publicly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unlike other Tamil Nadu politicians, Stalin\u2019s speech is devoid of drama, and goes directly to the issues at stake. According to a senior IAS officer who worked under Stalin when he was the deputy chief minister, that is true of the 63-year-old\u2019s style. \u201cStalin is not his father in terms of his political and literary talents. But definitely he is efficient and more transparent. Even if his wife or her family makes a demand, he would allow us to ignore them and go by our discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only when he gets around to talking about AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa that Stalin allows himself some flourish. Introducing Karthikeyan, the DMK candidate for Vellore, he says, \u201cJayalalithaa made 54 promises in the 2011 elections, 48 during the 2014 <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> polls.\u201d Imitating the Chief Minister, he asks of her, \u201cHave you fulfilled any of them? How many have you fulfilled?\u201d</p>\n<p>Delighted at the crowd response, his aides point out that in her own rallies, Jayalalithaa has spared only Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Stalin.</p>\n<p>P Ramajayam, a senior political analyst with the Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy, Trichy, says Stalin is unlike other political descendants. \u201cIt would be unfair to compare him to <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a> or G K Vasan or Anbumani Ramadoss. Ever since the Emergency, when he was arrested and severely tortured, Stalin has been active in the party. Ahead of his active entry into politics in the mid-\u201970s, a five-member party committee was formed to clear it,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Stalin has been an active politician since, but for a brief stint as a TV actor in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>As for his celebrated patience, sources close to the family say there was a time both Stalin and Alagiri would demand that their father step down. But unlike the impulsive Alagiri, Stalin used relatives to plead his case.</p>\n<p>A senior leader adds that now Stalin has come to realise that power will come to him when his father is ready. \u201cHe still can\u2019t get the party to implement his decisions,\u201d the leader points out. \u201cFor instance, Stalin didn\u2019t want A Raja, Dayanidhi Maran or Kanimozhi to attend poll campaigns in this election. But though he kept them away from his rallies, all are were there with Karunanidhi&#8230; Karunanidhi still retains his power even if the party is controlled by Stalin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wary about how the succession tussle in the DMK will play out, many partymen are also keeping their safe distance. Leaders in districts admit they have been instructed by the party headquarters to avoid bursting crackers during Stalin\u2019s trip, and not have any overt displays of affection.</p>\n<p>At times, the 63-year-old has himself turned away leaders. Actor-turned-politician Khushboo is a case in point. \u201cShe was forced to join the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> after Stalin started sidelining her, seeing the crowds at her meetings,\u201d says a DMK leader. During the Namukku Naame campaign too, second-level leaders complained of being kept in the dark.</p>\n<p>In this new push, some see the wheel coming full circle. Whispers in the party say that behind the changes is an increasingly powerful son-in-law, V Sabarish, 45. Three days ago, Stalin even issued a clarification that neither Sabarish nor son Udayanidhi Stalin, 38, had political ambitions.</p>\n<p>As Stalin breaks into an MGR song at the end of his Vellore rally \u2014 swaying his head like the superstar with the longest political shadow in the state \u2014 that is a script they have heard before in Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797721&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/battling-ahead-a-general-in-waiting-in-tamil-nadu-2797721/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/stalin-2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/stalin-2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Stalin 2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad19eff6049dd5571c755a3dacf699fc?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">namithans</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/stalin-1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">From the Vellore crowd, cheers of Thalapathi, Thangathalapathi (beloved general), future chief minister.

Gwalior recorded 144 ug/m3 in the 2014 report, trailing Delhi\u2019s 153 ug/m3 \u2014 the worst in the world that year. Cities like Kanpur, Ludhiana and Allahabad continue to feature among the top 20 cities with the highest PM 2.5 levels in the 2014 and 2016 reports.</p>\n<p>Asked if other Indian cities, which figure among the highest global contributors to PM 2.5 and PM 10, need to replicate steps taken by Delhi, one of the main authors of the study, Dr Sophie Germy, said, \u201cA lot more needs to be done in India, and some steps need to be replicated. But even in some high-income cities, particulate matter remains a problem despite intensive monitoring and steps to control pollution.\u201d</p>\n<p>Within India, the Central Pollution Control Board\u2019s (CPCB) monthly air quality analysis (AQI) shows that cities like Agra, Raipur, Faridabad, Ludhiana and Patna report more poor air quality days than metropolitan cities like Delhi and Bengaluru.</p>\n<p>\u201cPatna, Gorakhpur and Agra are reporting far more days in the very poor category than other Tier 2 and 3 cities. The dominant pollutant in these cities, even during summer months, is usually particulates, unlike cities like Delhi where pollutants like ozone and NO2 become dominant,\u201d a CPCB scientist said.</p>\n<p>Increased construction, boom in industrial activity and sharp spikes in use of vehicles could be responsible for these trends, he said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797627&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gwalior-allahabad-patna-raipur-among-worlds-most-polluted-cities-2797627/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/pollution-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/pollution-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">China Pollution Study</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad19eff6049dd5571c755a3dacf699fc?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">namithans</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/pollution-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">odd even, odd even phase II, phase II odd even, delhi odd even, odd even delhi, national green tribunal odd even, odd even national green tribunal, NGT odd even, odd even NGT, odd even latest, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Supreme Court orders Kerala Police to set up SIT to probe into wife-swapping charge in Navy</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/navy-wife-swapping-supreme-court-cbi-probe-2797360/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/navy-wife-swapping-supreme-court-cbi-probe-2797360/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:00:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 11:54:18 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797360</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The SC bench directed Kerala Police to set up an SIT headed by a police officer not below the rank of a DIG and conclude the probe in the 2013 FIR \"preferably\" within three months.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797360&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2777746 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/supreme-court759.jpg\" alt=\"Indian navy, wife swapping, supreme court, Navy wife swapping, wife swapping navy, navy supreme court, supreme court navy, supreme court, india news\" /> The Supreme Court of India, New Delhi.

Desai had voiced her support to the agitation and had promised to enter the shrine. The trustees of the dargah, along with political activists from the Samajwadi Party, Awami Vikas Party, Shiv Sena and the Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen had, however, declared they would not allow Desai inside.</p>\n<p>Amid protests by both sides, Desai had been led away from the shrine by the police. She was subsequently detained and later let off.<br />\n\u201cI have given my support to the agitation launched by activists here. However, I have an aggressive style of approaching issues. I would like to state that if the trustees do not relent on their stand in the next 15 days, the Bhumata Brigade will launch an aggressive agitation to get equal rights for women,\u201d Desai said on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, those who had opposed Desai earlier welcomed her visit to the dargah.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was not allowed that day because she had thrown a challenge. She is more than welcome to visit the shrine as a normal devotee. It would have been even better had she visited the place on her own rather than with a police contingent,\u201d AIMIM leader Haji Rafat Husain said.<br />\nThe Haji Ali Dargah is a 585-year-old shrine of Sayyed Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, located on an islet off the Mumbai coast. The trustees had decided to bar access of women to the grave some time in 2011, calling the practice un-Islamic. They had stated they were rectifying their earlier mistake of allowing women to touch the grave.</p>\n<p>Entry to the main hall of the shrine is segregated for men and women.

But we will not be able to verify these suspicions until she is in our custody and is interrogated.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Kolkata operation by a Special Task Force from Chittoor began after Lakshman (30), during interrogation, spilled the beans about Sangeeta. Once married, the police believe Sangeeta had separated from her husband, who was a pilot. \u201cWe were in Kolkata for a week but could not track her. But this time, we were able to gather evidence and seized her bank accounts.

February 2012 from Kolkata when she was going to attend a conference in Goa hosted by NGO ADAPT (Able Disable All People Together).</p>\n<p>The top court held that the decision to offload Ghosh was taken by the airlines \u201cin a callous manner\u201d, without any medical advice or consideration and her condition was not such that it required any assistive devices or aids.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo doctor was summoned to examine her condition. Abruptly and without any justification, a decision was taken to deboard her without ascertaining as to whether her condition was such which prevented her from flying,\u201d said the bench, adding it was also in violation of civil aviation rules.</p>\n<p>The court also underlined that differently-abled persons are unable to lead a full life due to barriers and discrimination faced by them in employment, access to public spaces and transportation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is to be borne in mind is that they are also human beings and they have to grow as normal persons and are to be extended all facilities in this behalf. Persons with disability are a most neglected lot not only in the society but also in the family. More often, they are an object of pity,\u201d it said.</p>\n<p>Citing Jeeja\u2019s case, the court said that \u201ca little care, a little sensitivity and a little positive attitude on the part of the officials of the airlines would not have resulted in the trauma, pain and suffering that she had to undergo\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797256&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/supreme-court-slaps-rs-10l-on-spicejet-for-offloading-disabled-flyer-2797256/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/08/spicejet-thumb.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/08/spicejet-thumb.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">spicejet-thumb</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837cd894d0f238e52cce2370f8f193c?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">12ananya</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/spicejet.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Spicejet, Spicejet flyer, Spicejet disabled flyer, Jeeja Ghosh, Spicejet fine, Spicejet Jeeja Ghosh, Supreme Court, disabled flyer, Spicejet disabled flyer, cerebral palsy, Spicejet cerebral palsy, Spicejet incident, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Both Centre, Kerala battle over credit for evacuating Indians from Libya</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/who-paid-for-evacuation-of-indians-from-libya-sushma-swaraj-oommen-chandy-stake-claim-2797059/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/who-paid-for-evacuation-of-indians-from-libya-sushma-swaraj-oommen-chandy-stake-claim-2797059/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:01:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 10:54:52 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Shaju Philip]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797059</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A total of 29 Indians have been evacuated from Libya out of which 16 are from Kerala and they reached Kochi this morning.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797059&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2788954 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/oommen-chandy-759.jpg\" alt=\"Oommen Chandy, sushma swaraj, Libya, Chandy libya, Libya Indians, Chandy Libya Indians, sushma chandy, libya indians, libya indians evacuation, indians in libya, kerala news, india news\" /> Kerala CM Oommen Chandy.\n<p>AS 29 Indians, including 16 from Kerala, who were stranded in war-torn Libya reached Kochi on Thursday, Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy engaged in another war of words with the Centre.</p>\n<p>A day after Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a>, while addressing an election rally in the state, sought to take credit for the evacuation, Chandy today claimed that his government bore the cost of bringing them back. \u201c<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sushma-swaraj-2/\">Sushma Swaraj</a> paid for the (flight) tickets during the earlier evacuations.

(Source: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> Maps)\n<p>The Border Security Force (BSF) has detained 18 Pakistani fishermen and seized two boats for violating the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) off Koteshwar coast in Kutch.</p>\n<p>The Pakistani fishermen were taken in the custody Wednesday, a day after the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) arrested 10 Indian fishermen off Jakhau coast.</p>\n<p>According to BSF officials, the border force\u2019s water wing intercepted the two fishing trawlers 35 km off Koteshwar border outpost.</p>\n<p>Approximately 350 kg fish, four fishing nets, a mobile phone, an ice box and 11 plastic jerrycans were also seized from the boats.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn 11th May 2016 at about 1330 hours, a special BSF petrol party apprehended 18 number of Pakistani fishermen along with 02 number of Pakistan fishing boats who were doing illegal fishing approximately 04 kilometres inside Indian waters in Nar Creek Area (sic),\u201d a release from the BSF stated Thursday.</p>\n<p>\u201cApprehended Pakistan fishermen are resident of Chhacha Jan Khan, district Thatta, Pakistan. The place of apprehension is approximately 35 kms from Koteshwar and approximately 4 kms from Sir Creek,\u201d stated the release.</p>\n<p>While the release stated that the detained fishermen have been handed over to local police, IG (border range) IK Jadeja said police were yet to receive a formal communication from the BSF.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is in our knowledge that 18 Pakistani fishermen have been detained by the BSF, but we have not been formally informed by the border force yet. After crossing the IMBL, they were found operating in a creek area which is a prohibited zone, and therefore their intention could be mala fide,\u201d I K Jadeja, IG, border range, told <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a>.</p>\n<p>The IG said after the BSF hands over the 18 fishermen to Kutch police, an FIR will be lodged. \u201cWe shall then take them to joint interrogation centre (JIC) in Bhuj for their interrogation by various police, various intelligence and defence agencies,\u201d said Jadeja.</p>\n<p>The boat seizure comes around two months after a red alert was sounded in the district following intelligence warning that 10 Pakistani terrorists might try to sneak in Kutch via the waterfront to carry out attack in India. The intelligence input had come close on the heels of half a dozen Pakistani fishing vessels found abandoned near Kutch coast in the preceding few months.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797325&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bsf-detains-18-pakistani-fishermen-off-gujarat-coast-2797325/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/gujarat-coast-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/gujarat-coast-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">gujarat-coast-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/435232d9d6e68bceac465179e73e0dbf?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kris1290</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gujarat-coast-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">pakistan fishermen, gujarat pakistani fishermen, gujarat coast fishermen, india news, gujarat news, pak fishermen gujarat</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:00:26 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:28:12 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797375</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Bhavita Lalwani has also been selected for the \u201cgoogle Summer of the code\u201d project, under which she will develop a regional language keypad (Indic Language input tool) for smart phones.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797375&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2784331 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/googlelogo_new_big.jpg\" alt=\"Google, Varun Malhotra, Google acquires Synergyse, Synergyse app, Synergyse start-up, Google apps, Google apps tutor, Google apps coach, technology, technology news\" /> \u201cThis project will develop intelligent layouts, which will be scalable to majority of Indian languages.

Earlier a flight was sent to Libya to evacuate the stranded Indians. Almost all of them were evacuated. Why didn&#8217;t they join them?&#8221; Chandy said about the questions faced by the Kerala government from the Centre on the issue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When the family members of the Keralites stranded in Libya approached me and told me that if flight ticket is given, they would be able to return, I told them that the state government will pay for the ticket,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>When pointed out that some of the family members have said they had to shell out Rs 7 lakh for four flight tickets to Kochi, Chandy said that expense would be borne by the state government.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The state government will reimburse that money. Due to some technical problem with regard to foreign exchange, to avoid delay in return, they paid their flight ticket,&#8221; Chandy said in a meet-the-press programme organised by the Ernakulam Press Club.</p>\n<p>Hours after 29 Indians, including five infants in the age group of one and half and two years and a pregnant nurse, were rescued from Libya, the Chief Minister said, &#8220;My government has not moved away from any responsibilities&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Amid tough triangular fight between <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>-led UDF, CPI(M)-led LDF and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>-led NDA for the crucial May 16 Kerala Assembly polls, Modi had said his government has rescued Indians including Keralites after being stranded in strife-torn Libya.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have some good news for you. Six families from Kerala and three Tamil Nadu residents, who were stranded in Libya, will return home safely tomorrow or day after. In total 29 persons have been rescued,&#8221; Modi had told a BJP election meeting in nearby Tripunithura.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

to the private firm and its owners, CBI alleged.</p>\n<p>CBI said that a deal between Antrix and Devas was fixed in principle in January 2005 for lease of S-Band transponders. However, the then Executive Director of Antrix signed it on behalf of Antrix six months later only after ensuring that Chandrashekhar and Vishwanathan were majority stakeholders in Devas multi-media. They continued in this position till 2008-09.</p>\n<p>The change in the board, where a US company represented by Chandrashekar and Vishwanathan had majority stakes, was never verified by Antrix as the agreement had been in violation of Shankara Committee which had recommended execution of any such agreement with an Indian company only, it was contended.</p>\n<p>CBI has alleged that when a proposal seeking budgetary support of Rs 269 crore for approving design, manufacture and launch of GSAT-6/INSAT-4E (PS1) was placed in the 104th meeting of the Space Commission on May 26, 2005, it was not informed that the agreement had already taken place with Devas Multimedia for leading out the S-Band.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The approval of Space Commission was obtained by keeping it in dark,&#8221; CBI alleged in its FIR.</p>\n<p>It alleged that on November 17, 2005 a note for the Cabinet was submitted for building the GSAT-6 satellite as earlier approved by the Space Commission.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Information regarding the agreement between Antrix Corporation Limited and Devas Multimedia Limited was suppressed from the Cabinet and the wrong information regarding utilisation of satellite capacity was given to the Cabinet with respect to multiple expressions of interest though the agreement was signed with Devas Multimedia without any multiple expressions of interest. The proposal was approved by the Cabinet in December 2005,&#8221; it said.</p>\n<p>CBI said in its FIR that after alleged omissions and commissions on the part of accused persons surfaced, the agreement dated January 28, 2005 was annulled by Antrix Corporation in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Security headed by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.</p>\n<p>CBI has alleged that Devas with the intent to siphon off the amount from its bank accounts in India got a subsidiary named Devas USA incorporated in USA and a substantial part of the &#8220;wrongful&#8221; gain was remitted to Devas USA on the pretext of services, salaries etc.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is suspected that the illegal gratification was paid to the accused public servants from the amount remitted from India as motive or reward for taking the aforementioned favour,&#8221; the agency alleged.</p>\n<p>ED is probing the financial transactions in the Antrix-Devas deal which included authenticity of a few Mauritius-based entities who had stakes in Devas Multimedia Pvt Ltd.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797355&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/antrix-devas-case-former-isro-chief-madhavan-nair-quizzed-by-cbi-2797355/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/10/g-madhavan-nair-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/10/g-madhavan-nair-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">G-Madhavan-Nair-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/435232d9d6e68bceac465179e73e0dbf?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kris1290</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/g-madhavan-nair-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">antrix devas deal, ISRO antrix devas deal, CBI antrix devas case, india news, Madhavan Nair, isro Madhavan Nair, Madhavan Nair antrix deal, isro scam, india news, latest news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Is ABVP targetting women at Jadavpur University?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/abvp-jadavpur-university-film-screening-rally-clash-2797294/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/abvp-jadavpur-university-film-screening-rally-clash-2797294/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:52:37 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:54:37 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Premankur Biswas]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797294</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[ABVP and Left-backed student groups had clashed on the campus over the screening of director Vivek Agnihotri\u2019s film Buddha in a Traffic Jam, triggering off chaos \u2014 some girls were allegedly molested.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797294&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2797308 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/abvp1.jpg\" alt=\"abvp1\" /> Police stop ABVP activists who were taking out a rally outside Jadavpur University campus in Kolkata on Monday to protest against alleged attack on them by the students of the University last Friday during the screening of Vivek Agnihotri&#8217;s film &#8216;Buddha in a Traffic Jam&#8217;. (Source: PTI)\n<p>Last Monday, when the West Bengal unit of the ABVP held a rally to protest against the alleged \u201canti-national activities\u201d at Jadavpur University, Debolina, a documentary filmmaker associated with Jadavpur University\u2019s Women Studies department, who was documenting the rally, approached a few journalists stationed outside Gate 4 where the rally was supposed to end. \u201cMay we please stay with you guys? ABVP supporters are trying to intimidate us. They are taking pictures of us, asking us where are we from. Some women from the rally even pushed us around,\u201d said Debolina.</p>\n<p>The incident is symptomatic of the kind of stand ABVP leaders seem to have taken on \u201cJU girls\u201d. Last Friday, members of the ABVP and Left-backed student groups had clashed on the campus over the screening of director Vivek Agnihotri\u2019s film Buddha in a Traffic Jam, triggering off chaos &#8212; some girls were allegedly molested. \u201cAfter the screening, outsiders who had come for the screening and identified themselves as ABVP members, abused us. They targeted female students, especially. Their language was misogynistic. Male students were shoved around while women were sexually assaulted. They grabbed us, pushed us, shoved us and manhandled us,\u201d said Debolina. Along with nine other girls, she lodged an FIR against the four ABVP members.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/abvp-jadavpur-university-film-screening-rally-clash-2797294/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/outside-jadavpur-university-ju-gates-abvp-threatens-to-chop-off-legs-of-anti-nationals-2792451/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jadavpur-university-4801.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Outside JU gates, ABVP threatens to \u2018chop off legs of anti-nationals\u2019</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/ensure-protest-rally-doesnt-affect-exams-jadavpur-vc-to-abvp-2790724/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jadavpur-4801.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Ensure protest-rally doesn&#039;t affect exams: Jadavpur VC Suranjan Das to ABVP</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/no-abvp-unit-here-so-where-do-supporters-come-from-2789934/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jadavpur-university-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">\u2018No ABVP unit here, so where do supporters come from\u2019</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/jadavpur-is-turning-into-a-center-for-disturbance-west-bengal-governor-2788798/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/ju-protest-4801.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">JU becoming centre for disturbance: West Bengal Governor</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/teachers-students-stop-abvp-rally-from-entering-ju-campus/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/ju-protest480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Teachers, students stop ABVP rally from entering JU campus</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/jnu-row-pro-afzal-slogans-at-ju-rally-students-blame-fringe-groups/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/ju-march-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">JNU row: \u2018Pro-Afzal\u2019 slogans at JU rally, students blame \u2018fringe groups\u2019</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>At Monday\u2019s rally, some ABVP leaders went on record with their criticism of female students of Jadavpur University. ABVP leader, Suman Dutta, accused \u201cJU girls\u201d of indulging in \u201cunnecessary drama\u201d. \u201cThese girls claim to be molested. Have you seen them? Someone should tell them that only girls who have shame can be molested\u2026 These girls kiss men openly. This is what they do all day,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>As if to prove point, some ABVP supporters released a picture of a crowd of young men and women kissing each other in an open field in various social media forums including <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/facebook/\">Facebook</a> and Whatsapp. The text accompanying the picture, in Bengali, said that this was a scene from Jadavpur University. The Jadavpur University\u2019s student\u2019s page was soon to post the picture with its original caption. \u201cIt was a photograph taken at a kissing festival in Peru, It was not Jadavpur University,\u201d said Pooja Sen of the English department of the university.</p>\n<p>Subir Haldar, state secretary of ABVP, claims that there has been no conscious effort to target female students of the university. \u201cThey have been twisting our words to make it sound like this. None of our supporters attacked any female students. It\u2019s the JU students who attacked us. Our party actually wants to protect women on the campus from being blind followers of Western culture. Our fight is against the anti-national activities happening in the university,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time that ABVP supporters have allegedly targeted female students of Jadavpur University, claims Titir Chakraborty, assistant general secretary of JU\u2019s Arts students\u2019 association. She says that in February, when teachers and students formed a human chain at the gates to restrict the entry of an ABVP rally, misogynistic slogans were chanted. \u201cDays before that rally, outsiders identifying themselves as ABVP supporters stormed our campus and tore down our posters. Alleging that &#8216;anti-national&#8217; slogans favouring Parliament terror attack convict Afzal Guru had been raised on the campus, they attacked us. They abused us,\u201d said Chakraborty.</p>\n<p>The fact that ABVP supporters consider \u201ckissing an anti-national activity,\u201d worries many JU students. \u201cIn one video I heard ABVP supporters talk about the \u201cantrabash\u201d (undergarments) of JU girls. Why are they so obsessed with us\u201d asks Pooja Sen.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797294&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/abvp-jadavpur-university-film-screening-rally-clash-2797294/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/abvp2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/abvp2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">abvp2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/abvp1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">abvp1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>WHO clears air: Delhi no longer most polluted, that\u2019s Zabol in Iran</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/delhi-pollution-no-longer-most-polluted-but-4-other-cities-in-top-7-who-2797288/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/delhi-pollution-no-longer-most-polluted-but-4-other-cities-in-top-7-who-2797288/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:36:13 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 09:13:26 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Pritha Chatterjee]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797288</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[According to a new WHO report, New Delhi was the 11th most-polluted city while Gwalior (2), Allahabad (3), Patna (6) and Raipur (7)  figured in the top seven.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797288&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2578163 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/delhi-pollution-759.jpg\" alt=\"delhi pollution, pollution in delhi, new delhi pollution, pollution in new delhi, delhi pollution report, WHO, WHO pollution report, WHO report pollution, delhi news, india news\" /> The report warned that over 80 per cent of the world&#8217;s city dwellers breathe poor quality air.\n<p>DELHI IS no longer the world\u2019s most polluted city, says WHO.

WHO safe limits for annual mean of PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels are 10 and 20 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively.</p>\n<p>The 2014 report had placed Delhi under the scanner with an investigative series by <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a> in March-April 2015 exposing how in spite of numerous studies and alarm bells at repeated intervals, political inaction and the administration\u2019s apathy set in motion a public health disaster in the making.</p>\n<p>This January 1, Delhi\u2019s AAP government, which came to power with a full term in February 2015, rolled out its odd-even vehicle rationing scheme \u2014 implemented in two 15-day spells so far \u2014 to control vehicular pollution.</p>\n<p>During most of the WHO study period, the capital was under the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> government led by Sheila Dikshit who lost power in December 2013. Following a 49-day reign by the previous AAP government that ended on February 16, 2014, Delhi was under President\u2019s rule until elections were held in early 2015, when AAP claimed a decisive victory.</p>\n<p>Nada Osseiran from the WHO\u2019s department of public health, environmental and social determinants of health told The Indian Express that the latest report ranked cities according to annual aggregates of PM 10 and PM 2.5 \u2014 the same as WHO\u2019s 2011 and 2014 analysis.</p>\n<p>Dr Sophie Germy, a co-author of the WHO report, told The Indian Express over phone that the stress in the latest, upgraded report \u2014 the 2014 report had analysed pollution levels in only 1,400 cities \u2014 was on PM 2.5 levels.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have stressed on PM 2.5 because it is the pollutant which is of most health interest globally. We have analysed annual rather than 24-hour averages or real-time air quality, because we wanted to understand exposure levels over long term and see its effects. We are trying to see if these findings can be linked to the global disease burden,\u201d said Dr Germy.</p>\n<p>According to WHO, the 2016 report had five times more access to PM 2.5 data globally than the 2014 report. \u201cThis is due to improved monitoring, more cities have started monitoring this critical pollutant,\u201d said Dr Germy.</p>\n<p>Asked about Delhi\u2019s success in reducing PM 2.5 levels, Dr Germy said, \u201cI think India needs to be congratulated for its intensive monitoring of air quality, in metros and now tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Delhi, in particular, has done a lot of things to reduce PM 2.5 levels. The main source of PM 2.5 in India is fuel burning and vehicles&#8230; in particular, cars. I think on both accounts Delhi has recognised these sources as a problem and taken steps to control it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr Germy, however, pointed out that the data was not \u201cimmediate\u201d. \u201cMost of the India data is from 2012-2013, and partly from 2014. So it is not the immediate real-time government data put out everyday. To capture the long term effects of pollution, we have taken time to analyse annual data which is why it is not immediate updated data,\u201d said Dr Germy.</p>\n<p>Asked if other Indian cities, which figure among the highest global contributors to PM 2.5 and PM 10, need to replicate steps taken by Delhi, Dr Germy said, \u201cA lot more needs to be done in India, and some steps need to be replicated. But one has to understand that even in some of the high- income cities, particulate matter continues to remain a problem despite intensive monitoring and steps to control pollution.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Among the other findings of the 2016 WHO report are:</strong></p>\n<p>* Urban air pollution levels were lowest in high-income countries, with lower levels most prevalent in Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific Region.</p>\n<p>* Highest urban air pollution levels were experienced in low-and middle-income countries in WHO\u2019s Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia Regions, with annual mean levels often exceeding 5-10 times WHO limits, followed by low-income cities in the Western Pacific Region.</p>\n<p>* In the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia Regions, and low-income countries in the Western Pacific Region, levels of urban air pollution increased by more than 5 per cent in more than two-thirds of the cities.</p>\n<p>* More than half of the monitored cities in high-income countries and more than one-third in low and middle-income countries reduced air pollution levels by more than 5 per cent in five years.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797288&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/delhi-pollution-no-longer-most-polluted-but-4-other-cities-in-top-7-who-2797288/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/delhi-pollution-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/delhi-pollution-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">DELHI-POLLUTION-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/435232d9d6e68bceac465179e73e0dbf?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kris1290</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/delhi-pollution-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">delhi pollution, pollution in delhi, new delhi pollution, pollution in new delhi, delhi pollution report, WHO, WHO pollution report, WHO report pollution, delhi news, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/capture12.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Capture1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>MEA awaiting ED&#8217;s advice on next action against Vijay Mallya: Vikas Swarup</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/mea-awaiting-eds-advice-on-next-action-against-vijay-mallya-vikas-swarup-loan-default-kingfisher-2797145/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/mea-awaiting-eds-advice-on-next-action-against-vijay-mallya-vikas-swarup-loan-default-kingfisher-2797145/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:19:23 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:20:39 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797145</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The UK has conveyed that as per its law it cannot deport Mallya but crown prosecution services would be ready to discuss the key issues to consider (request for extradition) with the Indian High Commission.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797145&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2628434 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/vikas-swarup759.jpg\" alt=\"vijay mallya, vijay mallya extradition, vijay mallya MEA, Vijay mallya news, vijay mallya kingfisher, mallya loan default, vijay mallya loans, india news\" /> MEA Spokesperson Vikas Swarup\n<p>External Affairs Ministry on Thursday said it was awaiting Enforcement Directorate&#8217;s &#8220;advice&#8221;

We see it very seriously. The Prime Minister made statement based on certain media reports&#8230;It is wrong..,&#8221; Chandy told a meet-the-press programme, organised by the Ernakulam press club in Kochi.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since he is the Prime Minister, he should have checked official records before making such statements. We are planning to take legal action (against the Prime Minister). Moving the Election Commission on this issue is also in our consideration,&#8221; Chandy said.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, in his <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/facebook/\">Facebook</a> post, Chandy, who had shot off a protest letter to PM on the issue, accused Modi of keeping mum on the controversy during his rally at Thrippunithura near Kochi late evening on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Stating that Kerala is far ahead than BJP-ruled Gujarat in addressing infant mortality rate and issue of malnutrition, the chief minister said what Keralites want is not his silence, but an unconditional apology from the Prime Minister.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are No 1 in Human Development Index while Gujarat is placed at 11th position. The Prime Minister should give us an explanation,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Chandy said Modi left the election campaign rally\u00a0Wednesday without answering his questions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It could be due to the wide criticism he had received not only from the state, but also from the Malayali community world over,&#8221; Chandy said.</p>\n<p>Attacking Modi for his Somalia remarks, CPI(M) State Secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said &#8220;one thing the Prime Minister should understand is that the state has no such situation as in Somalia because, BJP has never come to power.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Modi&#8217;s statement would result in a setback to BJP in the ensuing polls as it has insulted the people of the state,&#8221; he told reporters at Thiruvananthapuram.</p>\n<p>In a hard-hitting letter, Chandy had lambasted Modi recently for comparing Kerala to Somalia during his poll campaign rally here, saying he has insulted the state.</p>\n<p>He had also requested Modi to show some &#8220;political decency&#8221; by withdrawing the statement as they are &#8220;baseless and contrary to ground realities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The people of Kerala, whose self-pride was wounded by the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement, expected an unconditional apology from him and not his silence. But it didn&#8217;t happen,&#8221; he said, adding, Keralites still hoped he would withdraw his &#8216;Somalia&#8217; remark.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\"><strong>WATCH THE INDIAN EXPRESS NEWS PLAY LIST</strong></a></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797116&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/expect-unconditional-apology-not-silence-cm-oommen-chandy-to-pm-narendra-modi-after-somalia-remark-2797116/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/oommen-chandy-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/oommen-chandy-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">oommen-chandy-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837cd894d0f238e52cce2370f8f193c?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">12ananya</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/oommen-chandy-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Somalia remark, Kerala, Oommen Chandy, Narendra Modi, Somalia Kerala remark, Oommen Chandy Narendra Modi, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Telangana man burns alive two daughters, immolates self</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/telangana-man-burns-alive-two-children-immolates-self-2797049/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/telangana-man-burns-alive-two-children-immolates-self-2797049/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:54:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:54:04 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797049</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[His wife told police that he resorted to this due to a fight between them.

The present election presents totally a different picture in view of the fact that too many parties are in the fray and some of them have named their Chief Ministerial Candidates,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The social media also played a &#8220;considerable role now&#8221;, the DMK chief, whose party is reaching to voters through all forms of media, said.</p>\n<p>To a question on BJP&#8217;s efforts to gain ground in Tamil Nadu, Karunanidhi said that the saffron party will &#8220;fail&#8221; to do so in &#8220;this Dravidian heartland&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) of actor Vijaykanth is in alliance with People&#8217;s Welfare Front (PWF) and Tamil Maanila <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>. The PWF comprises Vaiko&#8217;s MDMK,<br />\nCPI(M), CPI and VCK.</p>\n<p>BJP is fighting the election in alliance with some small outfits in the state.</p>\n<p>Asked about the financial implications of implementing certain promises in the DMK poll manifesto, Karunanidhi said: &#8220;We never say what is not possible or feasible. Please wait and see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the issue of changing candidates after releasing the list, much like the AIADMK, Karunanidhi claimed that such changes were made in concurrence with the persons involved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;DMK has changed party nominees only in few constituencies where it was felt absolutely necessary. Even this was done after discussions with the nominees already announced. It was a very smooth change-over. It will, in no way, affect the prospects of our party in the elections.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On AIADMK&#8217;s promise of implementing prohibition, an issue that has taken centre stage in the polls, he said: &#8220;Tamil Nadu voters know very well that (chief Minister J) Jayalalithaa is<br />\nnot sincere in her announcements&#8221; and added that her assurance will &#8220;not affect DMK,&#8221; which has also made a similar promise.</p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796782&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/dmdk-bjp-led-alliance-would-not-impact-my-partys-prospects-karunanidhi/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/karunanidhi-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/karunanidhi-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karunanidhi-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6a37cab9e6d4aea837f1ec8082854e9f?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">adrijaroychow</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/karunanidhi-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Karunanidhi, Tamil Nadu assembly elections 2016, Karunanidhi interview, DMK, DMDK, BJP, DMDK BJP alliance in Tamil Nadu elections, DMK in Tamil Nadu elections, elections 2016, India news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Tamil Nadu: Widow of slain Dalit youth attempts suicide</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-honour-killing-widow-of-slain-dalit-youth-attempts-suicide-2796724/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-honour-killing-widow-of-slain-dalit-youth-attempts-suicide-2796724/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:57:21 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 07:00:50 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2796724</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Police, quoting her relatives, said she was depressed after the death of her husband.

File/PTI Photo\n<p>The signing of the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) for exchange of military logistics services between India and the US is unlikely to happen during Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a>\u2019s visit to the US next month. The progress on other major agreements announced last month during US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter\u2019s visit is also very slow.</p>\n<p>The highlight of Carter\u2019s visit to India in early April was the in-principle announcement by the two countries to sign LEMOA, an agreement which will allow the militaries of either country to avail logistics facilities on other\u2019s bases as per an established process, provided the two sides agree to it. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had then announced that no further comments can be made till the draft of LEMOA is returned by the defence ministry to Pentagon, which he expected to take around four weeks.</p>\n<p>Senior defence ministry sources, however, told <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a> that the draft of LEMOA has still not been shared with the Pentagon. \u201cThe process of inter-ministerial consultations is on and our effort is to conclude it as early as possible. We are hopeful of signing it in the near future. But there is no chance of LEMOA being signed during the Prime Minister\u2019s visit,\u201d a senior official said.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/defence-logistics-agreement-wont-be-signed-during-modis-us-trip-little-progress-on-other-agreements/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/ashton-carter-manohar-parrikar-india-us-agree-in-principle-to-use-each-others-military-bases/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/carter-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">India, US agree to share military supplies and fuel</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/delhi-needs-to-stay-the-course-with-the-us-to-raise-its-military-profile-in-the-long-term-keep-talking-4/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/ashton-carter-india-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Keep talking</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-fact-parrikars-visit-to-the-us-traversing-the-distance-from-symbolism-to-substance/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/manohar-parrikar480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Manohar Parrikar\u2019s US visit: traversing the distance from symbolism to substance</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/india-to-participate-in-exercises-rimpac-and-red-flag-in-us-next-year/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/11/parrikar480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">India to participate in world&#039;s largest maritime warfare exercise in US next year</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/in-a-new-frame/\"><span class=\"text\">In a new frame</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/ashton-b-carter-in-india-defence-pact-to-be-signed/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/06/ashton-b-carter-m.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">US Defence Secretary Ashton B.

Defence ministry confirmed that it had received the drafts in January, and had undertaken negotiations with the team from Pentagon.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrafts of the agreements, including LEMOA were delivered in the third week of January and we had a team of experts visit in the first week of February. They discussed each agreement with the members of MEA and MOD at the Joint Secretary level. JS(AMS) and JS(PIC) had received these drafts, besides others, and the drafts were also with the Indian Army, Air Force and Navy,\u201d US defence sources involved in the negotiation of agreements told The Indian Express.</p>\n<p>The LEMOA agreement is based on the Logistics Support Agreement (LSA) signed by the US with its closest allies. The LSA has been tailored to reflect India\u2019s concerns, where the language has been amended, as per Indian officials, \u201cto reinforce the non-contractual nature of the agreement\u201d.</p>\n<p>According to American sources, \u201cthere were minor changes in the text suggested during the negotiations. Sometimes we got the feeling if flying a team of lawyers from Pentagon to Delhi was really worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Carter had also announced the finalisation of a White Shipping Agreement between India and the US, which also got\u00a0delayed after the senior Pentagon official dealing with it, cancelled his trip to Delhi this month. According to Navy officials, \u201cWe already have a similar agreement with five countries and see no problems here. This agreement though will be signed by the Shipping ministry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another item mentioned during Carter\u2019s Delhi visit was the Aircraft Carrier Working Group established between the two navies, which is also unlikely to see any progress. This was to allow the transfer of American technologies to Indian Navy for the construction of its second indigenous aircraft carrier. While US officials expect the information exchange annexure to be shared by India in a couple of months\u2019 time, Indian Navy officials have told The Indian Express that this will have to await the finalisation of their own Project Report.</p>\n<p>The Ministry of Defence\u00a0has allotted Rs 25 crore to study and prepare a project report for the second indigenous aircraft carrier. A team of three officers, under a Rear Admiral, is working on the study. Once finalised, the report will freeze the navy\u2019s requirement, thereby allowing it to prepare the information exchange annexure to be shared with the US, sources in the navy said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796589&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/defence-logistics-agreement-wont-be-signed-during-modis-us-trip-little-progress-on-other-agreements/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/manohar-parrikar2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/manohar-parrikar2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">manohar-parrikar2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aae92616a6f221756428ed6d77d18339?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aaronexpress</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/parrikar1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">New Delhi: Union Defence Minister  Manohar Parrikar  shaking hands with his US counterpart  Ashton Carter in New Delhi on Tuesday.

It is a struggle between the values of humanism and the forces of inhumanity. It is also a battle that must be won through the strength of our values and the real message of religions,&#8221; Akbaruddin said at the Security Council open debate on &#8216;Countering the Narratives and Ideologies of Terrorism&#8217;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Countering the narratives of terrorism is a long-term preventive endeavour,&#8221; he said as he described terrorism as one of the &#8220;most serious threats to global peace and security&#8221;.</p>\n<p>He voiced concern that &#8220;narrow perceived interests have often prevented the framing of legal frameworks for international cooperation (to tackle terrorism) and even the effective implementation of sanctions that could restrict possible threats&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Equally important is effective counter-terrorism through monitoring and intervention that requires close international collaboration,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The Indian envoy emphasised that the ideological framework guiding the terrorist groups is their real strength and a concerted effort is needed to deny space for the spread of extremist ideologies and narratives and to launch specific counter-narratives.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The counter-narratives have to address the theories of victimhood, conspiracy and the denial of inconvenient facts contained in the terrorist ideologies,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Akbaruddin underscored that active engagement of local community and religious leaders may be necessary in disseminating more moderate and mainstream teachings challenging the radical and motivated interpretations.</p>\n<p>He said that terrorism thrives on and is sustained by its trans-boundary networks for ideology, recruitment, propaganda, funding, arms, training and sanctuary.</p>\n<p>The envoy stressed that tackling terrorism demands extensive global coordination and effort and the fight against terrorism is not succeeding so far because there is insufficient international cooperation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Hydra-like monster of terrorism continues to spread across continents in developing and developed countries alike, aided by the targeted propaganda of hatred over the ever growing social media networks that were designed to bring people together,&#8221;

(Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)\n<p>The CPI(M) leadership in Kerala is confident that the alliance between the Left party and the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> in West Bengal will not have any impact on the party&#8217;s prospects in Kerala simply because the state&#8217;s political equations are different.</p>\n<p>The CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front, which is engaged in a head to head fight against the ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front in Kerala, feels that the electoral alliance in Bengal was occasioned by the state&#8217;s prevailing unique ground level situation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was the Congress which had forged an alliance with the TMC and helped them remove the Left Front regime during the 2011 Assembly elections. Now the Congress had realized its mistake and there is an understanding based on the prevailing ground level situation in the state,&#8221; CPI-M politburo member M A Baby told PTI.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/bengal-alliance-will-not-have-impact-on-kerala-poll-cpim-2796447/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/udf-and-ldf-unite-in-fight-for-bjp-free-kerala-assembly/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/kerala-congress-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">UDF and LDF &#039;unite&#039; in fight for &#039;BJP-free Kerala Assembly&#039;</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-assembly-election-2016-congree-cpi-alliance/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/mamata2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Alliance yet to be sealed, Congress, CPI(M) holding joint protest</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cpm-west-bengal-election-the-communists-and-a-spectre-called-congress/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/cpm-red-2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">The communists and a spectre called Congress</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bengal-cong-wants-tie-up-with-left-says-no-to-mamata-banerjee/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/trinamool-cong-1200.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Bengal Cong wants tie-up with Left, says no to Mamata Banerjee</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/cpim-open-to-form-alliance-with-jayalalithaa-again-post-poll-sitaram-yechury/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yechuri-thumb.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">CPI(M) open to form alliance with Jayalalithaa again post poll: Sitaram Yechury</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/state-alliances-make-congress-ticklish/\"><span class=\"text\">State alliances make Congress ticklish</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>&#8220;It will not have any impact on our party&#8217;s prospects in Kerala because we are here fighting against the atrocities of the Congress government,&#8221; Baby said. However, a section of Kerala CPI(M) leaders felt that party comrades in Bengal campaigning together with Congress workers had given the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> ammunition for poll campaign in Kerala.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We very well understand that democracy needs to be restored in Bengal since hundreds of our party&#8217;s cadres have been killed in the five years of TMC rule, which is why an electoral understanding was chalked out with the Congress,&#8221; a CPI-M leader from Kerala, who did not wish to be named, said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But neither an alliance with the Congress nor sharing of platform with the Congress was the mandate of the central committee,&#8221; he said. Another Left leader from Kerala pointed out that it was a contradiction of the official party line adopted in the last party congress which called for keeping both the Congress party and the BJP at bay.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The CPI(M) is a national and not a regional party and it has to stick to the line adopted at the party congress,&#8221; he said on condition of anonymity. CPI(M) state secretariat member in Bengal Nepaldeb Bhattacharya said that &#8220;the alliance was a demand of the people of Bengal in order to fight against the autocratic rule of TMC&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In 2004, when the Left Front had supported the UPA at the centre, it did not have any impact,&#8221; he said. The BJP, which too is hoping to emerge as an alternative to UDF and LDF in Kerala, is going all out to make the alliance between the parties in Bengal an issue. &#8220;We are constantly saying this. Both the people of Kerala and Bengal will give them a befitting reply,&#8221; BJP national secretary Siddharth Nath Singh said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796447&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/bengal-alliance-will-not-have-impact-on-kerala-poll-cpim-2796447/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/west-bengal-polls-4801.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/west-bengal-polls-4801.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">west bengal polls 480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/17785f3ebe9c18421c5f0c2fe81c6aec?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">abhimanyuchakra</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/west-bengal-polls-7591.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">West Bengal elections, bengal elections 2016, Congress CPIM Bengal polls, Congress CPIM polls</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Uttarakhand: At first cabinet meet post Prez rule, Rawat govt to expedite old cabinet decisions</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttarakhand-cm-hairsh-rawat-cabinet-meeting-2796417/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttarakhand-cm-hairsh-rawat-cabinet-meeting-2796417/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:36:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:22:19 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2796417</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Rawat had regretted the heavy loss suffered by Uttarakhand due to prolonged political uncertainty in the state Wednesday and promised to work hard to make up for the loss.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796417&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2796432 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/rawat-7592.jpg\" alt=\"uttarakhand, hairsh rawat, president rule ends, congress, uttarakhand congress, uttarakhand cabinet meeting, uttarakhand govt, uttarakhand news, india news\" /> <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> leader Harish Rawat during a press meet in Dehradun on Wednesday after the Supreme Court approved that he won the trial of strength in the Uttarakhand Assembly.

PTI Photo\n<p>India was confused. #PoMoneModi was trending on Twitter, but beyond the Western Ghats, most had no clue what it meant. Yet there was no such confusion in the little strip of land between the mountain ranges and the Arabian Sea. Kerala had taken to social media with one-liners and memes to tell the world it was not accepting the comparison with Somalia, at least not without a 140-character fight.</p>\n<p>The trend started Wednesday in reaction to Prime Minister Narendra Modi comparing Kerala with Somalia at an election rally in the state.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYahan Keral ki janjaati, janta, ST Scheduled Tribe, usmey jo child death ratio hai, Somalia se bhi sthiti khatarnaak hai&#8230; Abhi kuchh din pehle&#8230; media mein dardnaak chitra dekhney ko mila&#8230;Jo Communist party ka qila maana jaata hai, jahaan voh hamesha jeet-ti hai, us Peravoor mein Scheduled Tribe ke baalak koode ke dher mein bhojan talaash kar rahe hain, yeh media mein prakaashit hua hai,\u201d</em> Modi said.</p>\n<p>(\u201cThe situation with the child death ratio among Scheduled Tribes in Kerala is scarier than even Somalia. Recently, one came across a tragic picture in the media.

It is a subtle way of asking someone to get lost, in this case the villain of the movie.</p>\n\n<p>The dialogue was a rage when the movie released in 2000 and still rings a bell with every Malayali, at least those in the voting age. In fact, the line was so popular that it was immortalised as a song, again picturised on Mohanlal, last year.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXBUHvNxkws&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]</p>\n<p>Ranjith, who wrote dialogues for the movie, refused to comment on the Twitter trend, but said the original dialogue was based on something his late friend Dr Satyanarayana used to say often. \u201cThe fact that something written so long ago reverberates in Kerala even now is a tribute to the man who passed away last month,\u201d he told <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a>.</p>\n<p>Tinu Cherian Abraham, the Bangalore-based PR professional who with his quarter of a million followers could have been instrumental in making the hashtag trend, said: \u201cWhen you go to a state and ask for their votes, you don\u2019t insult them as \u2018a Beemaru state\u2019 or compare them to Somalia. The voters of Bihar have reacted. This unwanted rhetoric is going to cost <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>.

Both Bills were passed by Rajya Sabha and returned to <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a>.</p>\n<p>Responding to the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>\u2019s demand for a dispute redressal mechanism under which a judge would resolve any dispute between the Centre and states on GST, Jaitley said, \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, I beseech you in the interest of Indian democracy not to go on this misadventure&#8230; With the manner in which encroachment of legislative and executive authority by India\u2019s judiciary is taking place, probably financial power and budget making is the last power that you have left. Taxation is the only power which states have.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gst-bill-judiciary-is-destroying-legislature-brick-by-brick-says-arun-jaitley-harish-rawat-rajya-sabha-2796065/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/difficult-to-accept-congress-demand-to-cap-gst-rate-jaitley/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/arun-jaitley-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Congress demand on GST cap difficult to accept, says Arun Jaitley</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/business/budget/bduget-2016-govt-can-exceed-growth-target-with-less-obstructions-says-jaitley/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/jaitley2-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Govt can exceed growth target with less political obstructions, says Jaitley</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/gst-will-become-a-reality-soon-reiterates-finance-minister-arun-jaitley/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/feat1.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">GST will become a reality soon, reiterates Finance Minister Arun Jaitley</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/winter-session-arun-jaitley-reaches-out-to-opposition-on-gst/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/11/arun-jaitley-4801.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Winter Session: Arun Jaitley reaches out to Opposition on GST</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hope-to-roll-out-gst-next-year-pm-narendra-modi/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/09/modi_ireland_480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">PM Modi: GST rollout in 2016, climate in India conducive for investment</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/govt-drops-plans-for-special-par-session-on-gst-bill/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/09/arun-jaitley-m.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">No special Parliament sitting, GST likely to miss April 2016 deadline</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>\u201cIt would be wholly misconceived for any political party to say, \u2018let us hand over the taxation power to judiciary\u2019.

He added that the Congress was ready to support the GST Bill if three main recommendations are accepted.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FecCZTvXW94\"><strong>WATCH VIDEO | Harish Rawat-led Congress Govt Back Again In Uttarakhand: An Analysi</strong></a>s<br />\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FecCZTvXW94&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have three suggestions. One is setting up of an independent dispute settlement mechanism, elimination of extra one per cent tax (on inter-state movement of goods) and introduction of upper cap on GST rate&#8230; If consensus on these three is arrived, we are ready to support,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>He also questioned the credibility of the current GDP growth figure of 7.6 per cent, claiming that neither the Chief Economic Advisor, the Governor of RBI, the London Economist, Wall Street Journal, investment bankers or research scholars believed it. \u201cThe numbers put out by the government are highly suspect. For the first time, the credibility of our GDP numbers has become an international issue,\u201d Ramesh said.</p>\n<p>Ramesh also raked up the issue of alleged irregularities by the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) in its KG basin gas project. He demanded a probe and asked the government not to be selective in investigating NPA cases, be it private or public companies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about a company (GSPC) which has taken loan of about Rs 20,000 crore and has to pay Rs 1,800 crore annually, while its income is only Rs 80 crore. Is it not a fit case of NPA?\u201d the Congress leader said.</p>\n<p>During his reply, Jaitley asked the Congress to either reconsider its three preconditions or allow a decision on the GST bill by vote.</p>\n<p>Addressing Congress leader Anand Sharma, Jaitley said, \u201cI will certainly be discussing with you and your colleagues.\u201d He added that the government would like to take up the GST bill in the monsoon session of Parliament.</p>\n<p>On the demand for an 18 per cent GST tax cap in the Constitution, Jaitley said there was no concept of such a cap when the UPA came out with the GST Bill, when it was referred to a Standing Committee, when the committee\u2019s recommendations were released, or when these recommendations were finalised.</p>\n<p>Stating that he had \u201cno difficulty with the figure of 18 per cent\u201d, Jaitley asked what would happen in case of a drought when some affected states want to impose a higher tax for a period of just one year. \u201cShould we amend the Constitution in such a case? We know how difficult it is,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>He also said there cannot be a uniform tax for commodities used by the \u201caam aadmi\u201d and products such as luxury cars.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796065&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gst-bill-judiciary-is-destroying-legislature-brick-by-brick-says-arun-jaitley-harish-rawat-rajya-sabha-2796065/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/arun-jaitley-4802.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/arun-jaitley-4802.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Arun Jaitley at press conference</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/arun-jaitley-7592.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\"> GST Bill, arun jaitley, Jaitley GST bill, Congress GST rate demand, Goods and Services Tax Bill, Finance Bill, Rajya Sabha GST Bill, Jaitley on GST bill, Congress GST Bill demand, Arun Jaitley Rajya Sabha, Indian Finance Minister, Politics news, India news, indian judiciary</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Allahabad University Vice-Chancellor protests interference: Let MPs do my job, I will quit</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/allahabad-v-c-alleges-political-interference-threatens-to-quit-2795680/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/allahabad-v-c-alleges-political-interference-threatens-to-quit-2795680/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 04:30:29 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 05:26:50 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Lalmani Verma]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795680</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Earlier this week, the university reversed its order on making online entrance tests mandatory for admission to post-graduate courses. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795680&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2689467\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/allahabad-university480.jpg\" alt=\"Allahabad University, Allahabad University admit card, au admit card ug, au ug 2016, Allahabad University hall ticket 2016, AU UG B Com hall ticket, allahabad university B SC hall tickets, AU UG hall ticket BA, allduniv.ac.in\" /> Allahabad University UG exam 2016: The results of UG courses are expected to release in May/ June.\n<p>ALLAHABAD UNIVERSITY Vice-Chancellor R L Hangloo accused the Centre of interfering in the varsity\u2019s internal matters on Wednesday, only to withdraw the allegation later and blame \u201cpolitical interference\u201d for bringing the varsity\u2019s administrative machinery to a \u201cstandstill\u201d.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, the university reversed its order on making online entrance tests mandatory for admission to post-graduate courses.

He also alleged that SP workers from nearly 12 districts had planned an attack on him. \u201cI have informed the HRD ministry about the situation,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>According to university sources, BJP MPs Vinod Sonkar, Mahendra Nath Pandey, Virendra Singh, MLA Krishna Paswan, MLC Laxman Acharya and party state general secretary Swatantra Deo Singh had visited the university last week and met the students who were on a hunger strike to protest the decision on online entrance tests.</p>\n<p>SP MLAs Satyaveer Singh Munna, Haji Parvez Ahmad Tanki, Prashant Singh, MLC Vasudeo Yadav and Congress MLAs Anugrah Narayan Singh and Rita Bahuguna Joshi also met the students on campus. The hunger strike began on May 4 and ended on May 9.</p>\n<p>According to sources, a group of BJP MPs met HRD Minister Smriti Irani recently to press for the restoration of the offline option. A subsequent communication from the ministry is learnt to have prompted the university administration to roll back its decision. \u201cThis will hurt the Digital India dream of this government,\u201d said Hangloo.</p>\n<p>The move to introduce online tests met with stiff resistance from students on the ground that the offline option is important for candidates hailing from remote areas with poor internet connectivity. The university administration relented a bit by allowing only undergraduates to take tests offline.</p>\n<p>Students, however, persisted with their protests and sought the help of their seniors in the main political parties, which, Hangloo alleged, led to political interference.</p>\n<p>The HRD ministry, meanwhile, sought to distance itself from the controversy on Wednesday. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, officials said the government\u2019s letter to Allahabad University only \u201cnoted\u201d that the varsity administration has no objection to holding offline entrance test this year and that the online mode could be launched from next year.</p>\n<p>The issue became a flashpoint in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday as Irani accused SP of threatening Hangloo. SP\u2019s Ram Gopal Yadav alleged that the VC had complained of interference by the Centre.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795680&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/allahabad-v-c-alleges-political-interference-threatens-to-quit-2795680/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/allahabad-university4801.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/allahabad-university4801.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">allahabad university480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/435232d9d6e68bceac465179e73e0dbf?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kris1290</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/allahabad-university480.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Allahabad University, Allahabad University admit card, au admit card ug, au ug 2016, Allahabad University hall ticket 2016, AU UG B Com hall ticket, allahabad university B SC hall tickets, AU UG hall ticket BA, allduniv.ac.in</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Adi Godrej first to speak out: Beef ban, prohibition are hurting economy</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/adi-godrej-first-to-speak-out-beef-ban-prohibition-are-hurting-economy-2796052/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/adi-godrej-first-to-speak-out-beef-ban-prohibition-are-hurting-economy-2796052/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 04:29:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 04:29:52 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[P Vaidyanathan Iyer]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2796052</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Clever democratic leaders make sure disadvantages are minimised, advantages maximised, says Godrej chairman.\r\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796052&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2796062\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/adi-godrej-759.jpg\" alt=\"Adi Godrej, industrialist adi godrej, beef ban, liquor ban, prohibition, godrej group, beef ban hurting economy, liquor ban hurting economy, indian express adi godrej, indian express news, india news, beef ban updates, prohibition updates, latest news\" /> Adi Godrej: Vedic Indians were beef-eaters.\n<p>INDUSTRIALIST Adi Godrej, chairman of the $4.1-billion Godrej Group, with diverse interests in fast moving consumer goods, real estate, consumer durables and furniture, Wednesday said the beef ban and liquor prohibition in certain states were hurting the economy.</p>\n<p>Godrej is the first leading voice from India Inc to speak out against beef ban and prohibition and point out its adverse impact on the economy.

He believes \u201cIndia will remain the fastest growing economy in the world&#8230; India will gradually emerge as a strong developed country\u201d.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/adi-godrej-first-to-speak-out-beef-ban-prohibition-are-hurting-economy-2796052/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/godrej-industries-q1-jumps-28-46-pct-to-rs-53-25-cr/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/08/m_id_409367_business.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Godrej Industries Q1 jumps 28.46 pct to Rs 53.25 cr</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/of-course-we-must-look-into-environmental-factors-but-not-by-stopping-development/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/02/m_id_359749_uid.jpg?w=150?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">\u0091Of course,we must look into environmental factors,but not by stopping development\u0092</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/solve-economic-reforms-adi-godrej/\"><span class=\"text\">Solve Economic reforms: Adi Godrej</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/wef-india-focuses-on-inflation-graft/\"><span class=\"text\">WEF India focuses on inflation,graft</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/godrej-mulling-em-acquisitions/\"><span class=\"text\">Godrej mulling EM acquisitions</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/godrej-township-in-ahmedabad-to-have-more-residential-space/\"><span class=\"text\">Godrej township in Ahmedabad to have more residential space</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>\u201cSome of the things are affecting growth, for example, the ban on beef in some states. (This) is clearly affecting agriculture, affecting rural growth. Because what do you do with all these extra cows? It is also affecting business, because this was a good source of income for many farmers. So that\u2019s a negative,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>In Vedic times, he said, Indians were beef-eaters. \u201cThere is nothing against beef in our religion. It is a practice that evolved over years of drought, and the elders said don\u2019t slaughter cows, preserve them for milk for children. That has turned into a religious belief. This is ridiculous. Vedic Indians were beef-eaters,\u201d Godrej said.</p>\n<p>The Bombay High Court, he said, has given a good judgement. \u201cNow the Bombay High Court has said that alright you can stop the slaughter of cows, but you can\u2019t stop consumption. It\u2019s silly to say that possession of meat, which is eaten all over the world, is a crime,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are certain things. Like, prohibition. In order to win elections and get women\u2019s votes, some states are doing that. Bihar has brought prohibition. Kerala has brought prohibition. Prohibition is bad for the economy. It\u2019s bad for social structure, for drinking doesn\u2019t reduce. It gives rise to bad liquor, and then mafia. All over the world it has been unsuccessful. In America, it has been unsuccessful. In India, we tried prohibition, but we were unsuccessful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll these negative directions for political gains can affect the economy. These (beef ban and prohibition) are the two main issues I see,\u201d Godrej said. Asked if this distracts the government from the development agenda, he said, \u201cThese are bound to happen. We are a democracy. They have to win elections, they have to portray themselves in a certain way.\u201d</p>\n<p>But he said this was normal in a democratic set-up. \u201cThis is part of democracy. In democracy, you must understand, there are lots of advantages over dictatorship or autocracy,\u201d Godrej said. \u201cBut clever democratic leaders will make sure that the disadvantages are minimised and the advantages are maximised.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796052&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/adi-godrej-first-to-speak-out-beef-ban-prohibition-are-hurting-economy-2796052/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/adi-godrej-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/adi-godrej-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">adi godrej 480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/adi-godrej-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Adi Godrej, industrialist adi godrej, beef ban, liquor ban, prohibition, godrej group, beef ban hurting economy, liquor ban hurting economy, indian express adi godrej, indian express news, india news, beef ban updates, prohibition updates, latest news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>DMK doesn\u2019t know how to use me&#8230;won\u2019t vote this time: MK Alagiri</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-2016-alagiri-stalin-karunanidhi-dmk-2796040/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-2016-alagiri-stalin-karunanidhi-dmk-2796040/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 04:25:30 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 04:25:30 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Arun Janardhanan]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2796040</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Alagiri\u2019s disappearance from the poll scene has left many of his supporters in southern Tamil Nadu in a fix.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796040&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2796054\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/alagiri.jpg\" alt=\"tamil nadu elections, DMK M K Stalin, M K Alagiri, M Karunanidhi, DMK, tamil nadu polls, elections in tamil nadu, dmk, tamil nadu dmk, karunandhi, tamil nadu elections news, india news, chennai news, latest news\" /> From Alagiri album: with family on Pongal.\n<p>On May 7, as DMK leader M K Stalin addressed a massive rally in Madurai, his elder brother M K Alagiri sat in deep sulk at his palatial bungalow on the outskirts of the town. \u201cI have no opinion,\u201d he says of the election in which his father is contesting for the 13th time. And then for good measure: \u201cI will not vote for any party this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>While the patriarch,\u00a0M Karunanidhi, has made it clear that he will be chief minister should the DMK come to power \u2014 \u201cIf he (Stalin) has to get a chance, nature has to do something to me,\u201d he said on Tuesday \u2014 there\u2019s no doubt that the 63-year-old Stalin is the chosen one. Alagiri knows this better than anyone else, but has never been able to come to terms with his younger brother\u2019s rise in the party.</p>\n<p>Karunanidhi had seen this coming long ago and so, in 1980, he sent Alagiri to Madurai, ostensibly to look after the party and to run Murasoli, the DMK mouthpiece. For 36 years, he lorded over the district.</p>\n<p>Now, with his brother running a high-voltage campaign, Alagiri says he has no stake in it.</p>\n<p><b><div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-2016-alagiri-stalin-karunanidhi-dmk-2796040/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-dmk-m-karunanidhi-2793783/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/05/karunanidhi-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Tamil Nadu: I will be CM if DMK wins assembly polls, says Karunanidhi</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/alagiri-backs-great-man-modi-as-pm/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alagiri11.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Alagiri backs \u2018great man\u2019 Modi as PM</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/alagiri-said-stalin-would-die-in-3-4-months-karunanidhi/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/dmkt.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Alagiri said Stalin would die in 3-4 months: Karunanidhi</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/karunanidhi-cracks-whip-suspends-son-alagiri-from-all-dmk-posts/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/alagirit.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Family feud spills over in DMK, Karunanidhi suspends Alagiri</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/a-quieter-alagiri-returns-where-he-once-reigned/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/03/m_id_369547_m_k_alagiri.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">A quieter Alagiri returns where he once reigned</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/alagiri-revives-dmk-war-after-father-no-one-can-be-my-leader/\"><span class=\"text\">Alagiri revives DMK  war: after father,no one can be my leader</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</b></p>\n<p>\u201cIt has been three years&#8230; at least two-and-half years,\u201d says Alagiri about the last time he spoke to Stalin. Speaking on the phone from Madurai, he adds he hasn\u2019t spoken to his half-sister Kanimozhi in almost three years.</p>\n<p>About the party\u2019s chances in Madurai, he says, \u201cThey (DMK) don\u2019t know how to use me.</p>\n<p>I am not interested in this kind of politics.\u201d Is he willing to bet on how many seats the DMK will win in Madurai\u2019s 10 constituencies? \u201cNot a single seat,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>This is a very different Alagiri from the one Madurai saw in the summer of 2011. That election, he was everywhere \u2014 the centre of almost every controversy, the target of rivals\u2019 barbs. At her rally in Madurai, AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa had said, \u201cThis is the chance for the common man to punish the DMK for scams, kangaroo courts and rowdyism. If not now, when,\u201d she had asked, urging the voters to bring back the \u201crule of law\u201d in Madurai.</p>\n<p>That was the time that Alagiri was in the news for all the wrong reasons. \u2018Pottu\u2019 Suresh, \u2018Attack\u2019 Pandi, \u2018Karate\u2019 Pandian were among the mafia leaders who allegedly thrived under Alagiri\u2019s self-styled rule in Madurai. He was also named as an accused in the murder of \u2018Pasumpon\u2019 T Kiruttinan, a former DMK minister close to Stalin, but was acquitted in 2007.</p>\n<p>Alagiri\u2019s disappearance from the poll scene has left many of his supporters in southern Tamil Nadu in a fix. \u201cWe can\u2019t be seen supporting him openly. Also, who knows, one day he will settle all the issues with his family and we will be thrown out of the party. So we meet him, but keep a low profile,\u201d says an aide.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Alagiri was in power, he misused it. He was indifferent to people, he was erratic in his work, he rarely turned up in Parliament when he was MP and union minister. But he is also a generous man who helps poor people and supports their children\u2019s education. Everyday, some 100 people visit him at his home,\u201d says one of his closest friends.</p>\n<p>These days, his routine is rather unremarkable: wakes up at 7am, go for a walk, meets people, lunch, a short siesta, meets visitors again and retires for the day by 6 pm. \u201cI get a lot of visitors everyday, mostly friends and followers. I also watch cricket \u2014 that\u2019s my favourite past time,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Away from such benign indulgences, there\u2019s something serious brewing on Alagiri\u2019s turf. Many of his loyalists <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a> spoke to say they are working to defeat two candidates this election: P D R B Thiyakarasan of Madurai Central constituency and K Thalapathi of Madurai West, both known to be close to Stalin. \u201cNo senior leader is involved in this. We have boys on the ground to defeat them,\u201d says an Alagiri supporter.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH

When I refused, the organisation lodged a complaint with the PMO. Officers in my department, such as Additional Secretary B K Prasad, began pressuring me to give a clean chit to Ford Foundation. When I refused, all these allegations of corruption were levelled against me. I never removed the file on Sabrang Trust either,\u201d Joshi alleged.</p>\n<p>Prasad dismissed the allegation, saying \u201che (Joshi) is talking rubbish. This is a matter of CBI investigation. The truth will come out.\u201d</p>\n<p>A statement issued by Ford Foundation Wednesday said, \u201cRecent allegations that the Ford Foundation offered a Rs 250-crore bribe are outlandish and untrue. No such overture or suggestion has ever been made, and the foundation rejects this desperate allegation completely and unequivocally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Ford Foundation is proud of its record of partnership with the people of India and around the world over the last 60 years. Our mission to reduce poverty and injustice, strengthen democratic values, promote international cooperation and advance human achievement is manifest in the thousands of Indian institutions, research institutes, prominent academics and leading civil society organisations that we have invested in since 1952. This history is a testament both to what we believe and how we behave,\u201d it said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a deep and thorough respect for the Government of India and for the laws of the land. Over the past year, we have worked diligently to address issues raised by government and renew a partnership built on trust. We are honoured to be able to serve the people and institutions of India and look forward to many more years of doing so,\u201d the foundation said.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, after her husband went missing, Meenakshi Joshi repeated the allegation he had made: \u201cHe was under a lot of pressure.</p>\n<p>He was transferred last year after accusations of accepting bribes from NGOs were made against him. During his tenure as Under Secretary, he had put a ban on Ford Foundation. This happened after a woman associated with the company approached him in December and offered him Rs 250 crore. He refused to take the money. The woman then went to the PMO and filed a complaint against him. He was then questioned regarding these charges.\u201d</p>\n<p>She said when she woke up around 7 am, her husband was missing \u2014 they live in Media Times Apartments in Indirapuram.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe main door was ajar. We called all our friends and relatives but couldn\u2019t find him. Ghaziabad police registered a missing person\u2019s case. He only left behind a note. He had been under a lot of stress lately. He has been taking medicines for depression. Last night, he did not eat. People are saying he disappeared because he is guilty in the corruption case. They should conduct a proper inquiry into the matter, everything will be clear,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe CBI searched our house on Sunday. All they found was Rs 7.5 lakh, of which Rs 5 lakh belonged to my father-in-law. Even at the bank, they found jewellery worth Rs 1.5 lakh. If my husband was a corrupt officer, will he have only this much money with him?\u201d Meenakshi asked.</p>\n<p>In the note he left behind for her, Joshi wrote, \u201cFor the last few months, I have undergone a lot of mental harassment but now it has crossed all limits&#8230; I need some peace which is not possible here. I am leaving the house. Please do not try to look for me. Now, you will have to be the father and mother of our children&#8230; After serving my country with patriotism and integrity, I did not expect this. I have probably made a lot of enemies while working for the country. It pains me to leave but right now I am unable to understand anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>SSP Ghaziabad Dharmendra Kumar said a report was filed after the family approached police. \u201cA missing person\u2019s report has been filed at Indirapuram police station in the evening. Investigations are underway. If he is not found in two days, a case under relevant sections of the IPC will be filed,\u201d Kumar said.</p>\n<p>While Home Ministry officials declined comment saying the case against Joshi was being investigated by the CBI, the probe agency said it would send summons again. \u201cHe was supposed to appear before CBI today. We will summon him again,\u201d a CBI spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>Official sources claimed Joshi had sent notices to around 60 NGOs for \u201cviolation\u201d of FCRA provisions in November 2015. Some of Joshi\u2019s seniors in the Home Ministry may be questioned by investigators over the notices to the NGOs, sources said.</p>\n<p><em>\u2014 With ENS inputs</em></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795649&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/on-day-he-was-to-appear-before-cbi-home-officer-goes-missing/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/joshi.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/joshi.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">joshi</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b2bebe1057d92271788ba056079609a0?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">nishantshekhar1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/anand-joshi-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Anand Joshi, MHA official missing, NGO foreign funding, CBI probe on Ananad Joshi, Ford Foundation, Ford Foundation funds case, Foriegn NGO Ford foundation, fcra, Teesta Setalvad, Ford Foundation, Foriegn NGOs funding, Anand Joshi, MHA Under Secretary missing, Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, Teesta Setalvad trust file, CBI, CBI inquiry, sabrang trust, indian express news, india news, teesta news, latest news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Hindu Sena holds havan for Donald Trump, the \u2018saviour of humanity from Islamic terror\u2019</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hindu-sena-holds-havan-for-donald-trump-the-saviour-of-humanity-from-islamic-terror-2796039/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hindu-sena-holds-havan-for-donald-trump-the-saviour-of-humanity-from-islamic-terror-2796039/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 04:00:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 04:00:22 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Naveed Iqbal]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2796039</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Members of the Sena believe that Trump is the man who will \u201csave humanity from Islam and Islamic terror.\u201d<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796039&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2796043\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/trump-havan-759.jpg\" alt=\"donald trump, trump, shiv sena, hindu sena, havan for trump, US presidential elections, trump havan, islamic state, islamic terror, ISIS, indian express trump, indian express ISIS, indian express news\" /> Activists of Hindu Sena offer prayers for the victory of Donald Trump at Jantar Mantar Wednesday.

DU spokesperson Malay Neerav said the VC had ordered that only the Registrar would be dealing with the media on this issue.</p>\n<p>Before meeting the VC, the AAP leaders held a press conference questioning the statement made by the Registrar to a TV channel Tuesday evening and alleged that DU officials were \u201cunder pressure\u201d from the BJP. \u201c&#8230; The Registrar\u2019s statement has nothing to do with what is there in the degree,\u201d said the AAP leaders.</p>\n<p>The AAP also alleged that Maharashtra-based activist Anil Galgali had filed an RTI application in September 2015 asking for records of all students who graduated from DU in 1978, but the university claimed \u201cit did not maintain three to four decade-old records\u201d. \u201cIf the DU had not lied in their reply to Galgali, how have they dug out Modi\u2019s degree and marksheets now? Either they were lying then or they are lying now,\u201d said the AAP leaders.</p>\n<p>Singh said the AAP \u201chas all the proof\u201d of the forgery of documents, and would approach whichever probe agency required to \u201ctake this issue to its logical conclusion\u201d.</p>\n<p>The AAP raised eight questions about the validity of the marksheets released by Shah and Jaitley. Among the questions was one highlighting the display of \u201c<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/how-did-modi-get-computer-typed-mark-sheet-in-1978-aap-degree-row-pm-aam-aadmi-party-ashutosh/\">computer typed marksheet\u201d</a> when there were no computers in India in 1978. \u201cBill Gates must have sent a computer specially at the time knowing that Modi ji will become PM in 2014, so his degree needs to be printed now,\u201d said AAP spokesperson Ashutosh.</p>\n<p>The AAP pointed out the marks of other persons who graduated in 1978 were handwritten, while the marksheets for Narendra Damodardas Modi were \u201cprinted\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796023&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/second-day-in-a-row-aap-fails-to-get-hands-on-pm-modi-marksheet-2796023/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/modi-degree-sdmall.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/modi-degree-sdmall.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">modi-degree-sdmall</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/modi-degree.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Second day in a row, AAP fails to get hands on PM Modi marksheet</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Tainted by graft, ex-DMK ministers struggle</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-elections-tainted-by-graft-ex-dmk-ministers-struggle-2796014/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-elections-tainted-by-graft-ex-dmk-ministers-struggle-2796014/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 03:45:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 03:45:06 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Arun Janardhanan]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2796014</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Among those with a tainted image is senior DMK leader K Ponmudi, who served as the higher education and the mines minister in the previous government<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796014&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2796028\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/dmk-ministers-759.jpg\" alt=\"tamil nadu elections, DMK, ex DMK ministers, tamil nadu corruption, dmk corruption dmk corrupt ministers, K Ponmudi, indian express elections, indian express tamil nadu\" /> (From left) K N Nehru is among the former ministers to buck the trend, Durai Murugan and E V Velu face tough electoral battles.\n<p>ONCE formidable forces on their home turfs, a number of former DMK ministers, fighting corruption charges, are now facing uphill battles in their constituencies.</p>\n<p>Among those with a tainted image is senior DMK leader K Ponmudi, who served as the higher education and the mines minister in the previous government.

Velu is being accused of alienating the majority Mudaliar community, who are apparently backing his main rival, the AIADMK\u2019s Perumal K Rajan. The ADMK candidate also enjoys the support of Vanniyars, another community with a sizeable vote bank in the area.</p>\n<p>It is a similar story with Durai Murugan, the veteran DMK leader infamous for having allegedly pulled the sari of J Jayalalithaa in the state assembly in 1989. The former state PWD minister is up against it at his once pocket borough of Katpadi \u2014 a constituency where he has won six times.</p>\n<p>While Murugan is being blamed for his inaccessibility, even DMK supporters vouch for his main rival, the ADMK\u2019s SRK Appu. \u201cIt was Appu who initiated relief work for the Chennai flood victims here. Murugan was forced to do the same the very next day as the media highlighted Appu\u2019s efforts. Murugan\u2019s MLA office was also locked for a very long time and it was only after Appu clicked photos of it and put it in newspapers that Murugan acted. He deployed people to remove the bushes and reopened the office,\u201d said Perumal, a local taxi driver.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, the PMK has fielded former Union minister N T Shanmugam. \u201cThe Vanniyar votes are also not going to Murugan as N T Shanmugam enjoys a clean image,\u201d said a businessman.</p>\n<p>One of the former DMK ministers to buck this trend is K N Nehru. The veteran is contesting from Trichy. Although he faces major allegations of corruption, land grabbing and rowdyism, Nehru has managed to hang onto his influence in this city, the fourth largest in the state in terms of population.</p>\n<p>Nehru\u2019s father was a zamindar, who named his son after Jawaharlal Nehru due to his association with the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>. He was an accused in several land grabbing cases along with his younger brother K N Ramajayam, who was killed in March 2012. The murder remains unsolved. \u201cNehru will definitely win the election. After his brother\u2019s murder, he has changed a lot,\u201d said a DMK leader in the rival camp.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796014&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-elections-tainted-by-graft-ex-dmk-ministers-struggle-2796014/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/dmk-ministers-480-1.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/dmk-ministers-480-1.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">DMK ministers 480 1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/dmk-ministers-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">tamil nadu elections, DMK, ex DMK ministers, tamil nadu corruption, dmk corruption dmk corrupt ministers, K Ponmudi, indian express elections, indian express tamil nadu</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>In Tamil Nadu, deafening silence around the Dalit vote</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/elections-in-tamil-nadu-deafening-silence-around-the-dalit-vote-2796007/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/elections-in-tamil-nadu-deafening-silence-around-the-dalit-vote-2796007/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 03:34:43 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 03:34:43 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nirupama Subramanian]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2796007</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Just two months ago, Sankar was hacked to death in Udumalpet town for marrying Kausalya, 19, who belongs to the Thevar caste, a powerful OBC group in Tamil Nadu.

From inside the dark single-room house emerges a young woman. \u201cI am C Kausalya, Sankar\u2019s wife,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Just two months ago, Sankar was hacked to death in Udumalpet town for marrying Kausalya, 19, who belongs to the Thevar caste, a powerful OBC group in Tamil Nadu. Sankar died on the way to hospital. Kausalya survived, after 36 stitches to her head. The assailants were alleged to have been hired by Kausalya\u2019a family. Eleven people, including her parents and her mother\u2019s brother, and eight others are in Kovai prison.</p>\n<p>Tamil Nadu was the first state in the country to rebel against caste. Periyar\u2019s movement for social justice gave birth to the Dravidian movement, which in turn led to the state\u2019s two main political formations, the DMK and the AIADMK, that have ruled the state by turn since 1967. The state\u2019s quota of 69 per cent seats in education for Dalits and backward castes is the highest. Today, however, crimes against Dalits in Tamil Nadu are among the highest in India, with the caste narrative moving from the anti-Brahmanism of the first half of the 20th century to an anti-Dalit consolidation by the state\u2019s predominant intermediate castes. With strong political backing from parties such as Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), backward castes such as Thevars and Vanniyars have clashed repeatedly and violently with Dalits, unable to come to terms with the fact that new generations of Dalits are educated, more assertive, and a challenge to entrenched hierarchies.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/elections-in-tamil-nadu-deafening-silence-around-the-dalit-vote-2796007/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-honour-killing-widow-of-slain-dalit-youth-attempts-suicide-2796724/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/dalit-2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Tamil Nadu: Widow of slain Dalit youth attempts suicide</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/a-time-to-love-and-a-time-to-die/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/caste-war-thumb.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Amid Tamil Nadu&#039;s caste rivalry and honour killings: A Time to Love and A Time to Die</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/dalit-murder-in-tirupur/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/dalit-2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Dalit Murder in Tirupur</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/dalit-murder-in-tamil-nadu-five-arrested-mother-in-law-absconding/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/tamil-small.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Dalit murder in Tamil Nadu: Five arrested, mother-in-law absconding</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/dalit-youths-murder-girls-father-surrenders-video-of-attack-goes-viral/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/dalit-2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Dalit murder in Tamil Nadu: Father-in-law claims responsibility for murder, video of attack goes viral</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/eight-months-after-he-married-thevar-woman-dalit-hacked-to-death-in-tamil-nadu/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/dalit-2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Dalit man hacked to death 8 months after he married Thevar woman</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss, aspiring to be the next chief minister, bristles at the suggestion that his party represents only Vanniyars. \u201cHow can you say we are a communal party? We are fighting for the welfare of all sections of society. There are 46 reserved constituencies but the PMK has put up 48 Dalit candidates. Which other party has done that,\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>With the two main Dravidian outfits wooing dominant backward castes and with no Mayawati-like Dalit leader, votes of the community, about 22 per cent of Tamil Nadu\u2019s population, is split. The silence on issues affecting Dalits is deafening. It is also in contrast to the loud caste assertions in daily life.</p>\n<p>The Viduthalai Chiruthaikal Katchi (VCK), or Dalit Panthers, is in the People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) along with Vijayakanth\u2019s DMDK, Vaiko\u2019s MDMK, G K Vasan\u2019s Tamil Manila <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>, the CPI and CPM. VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan, who is contesting in Kattumannarkovil reserved constituency in <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/columnist/p-chidambaram/\">Chidambaram</a>, garlands Ambedkar statues wherever he goes, but stays off Dalit issues in speeches.</p>\n<p>At a small hamlet in the constituency, he canvasses for PWF, asking people to \u201cvote for change, vote for PWF\u201d. Later, he tells <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a> that the main Dravidian parties have \u201cbetrayed\u201d Dalits. \u201cJayalalithaa never condemns caste atrocities. DMK sometimes does under pressure from us, but never on its own. How can they? They need the support of caste Hindus to run their parties,\u201d he says. The PMK\u2019s objective, he says, has been to consolidate all non-Dalit intermediate castes against the Dalits.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Sankar\u2019s killing is not a talking point in this election. No candidate in Madathukulam constituency, in which his village falls, has visited the home where the young widow now lives with her dead husband\u2019s father, two brothers and an ageing grandmother.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a family issue, it is not relevant to the election,\u201d says Ramesh Ramalingam in nearby Karatholuvu. From western Tamil Nadu\u2019s dominant Kongu Vellalar Gounder caste, Ramalingam says Sankar\u2019s murder shocked the entire area, but \u201cis over now\u201d. Ramalingam also says he would not blame either the boy or the girl, and that Kausalya\u2019s parents should have let their daughter go peacefully. \u201cThere was no need to kill. But the parents cannot be blamed either \u2014 every person is born to a caste (and)&#8230;when the daughter does something unacceptable like this, in a moment of anger, parents can do anything,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Were his daughter to choose to marry a Dalit, he says, \u201cI would say you can go anywhere and live as you choose. Just don\u2019t come in front of my eyes. I would cut off all ties with her. However educated the boy, whatever his money power, only community matters\u201d.</p>\n<p>With her two young brothers-in-law sitting next to her, Kausalya speaks confidently. \u201cI am not bothered about caste because I am educated. Sankar told me he is a Dalit. I told him I did not care. I only wanted to be with him,\u201d says Kausalya, speaking in Tamil and English. She had also learnt Japanese in college, hoping to get a placement in a Japanese company. \u201cI want to educate Sankar\u2019s brothers, so that they can get ahead in life.

A string of villages \u2014 karas (land) in local parlance \u2014 criss-crossed by natural and man-made waterways that channelise the waters of five rivers and the Vembanad backwaters, this assembly constituency in Alappuzha district saw unusual political activity last week.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> addressed a rally at Edathua, a village in the region, while Chief Minister Oommen Chandy spoke at a series of meetings here. At Pulinkunnu, an old Christian settlement on one of the Pamba\u2019s distributaries, a day before Modi\u2019s arrival, Chandy said the fight in a lot of constituencies in Kerala, which votes on May 16, was between the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>-led UDF and the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>-led NDA. It created a stir. Senior Congress leaders including A K Antony and state party chief V M Sudheeran suggested that Chandy may have erred in giving prominence to the BJP, over the Left Democratic Front (LDF), as the UDF\u2019s main political rival.</p>\n<p>Did Chandy goof up at Pulinkunnu? Not really. He had only tailored his speech to address the specific nature of the local contest, where the UDF and the LDF face a stiff challenge from the NDA candidate. The chief minister needed to shore up the support of the anti-BJP vote, especially among the minorities, in favour of the Congress by positing the UDF as the real rival to the NDA.</p>\n<p>The local bodies election had revealed that a significant section of Christians and Muslims, who make up about 45 per cent of the state\u2019s electorate and traditionally back the UDF, may have supported the LDF.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-elections-2016-breaking-new-ground-in-kerala-backwaters-hindu-front-hopes-to-drop-anchor-2795988/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/oomen-chandy-counters-narendra-modi-how-can-pm-say-somalia-exists-in-india/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/modi-chandy-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Kerala CM Oommen Chandy counters PM Modi: How can PM say Somalia exists in India?</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-elections-real-fight-is-between-udf-bjp-in-some-constituencies-says-oommen-chandy-2788942/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/oommen-chandy-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Kerala elections: Real fight is between UDF, BJP in some constituencies, says Oommen Chandy</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/vs-achuthanandan-93-cpim-strongman-gets-ready-for-another-electoral-battle-2773890/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/achuthanandan-4801.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">CPI(M) leader VS Achuthanandan gets ready for another electoral battle at 93\u00a0\u00a0</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-assembly-elections-2016-pm-narendra-modi-sonia-gandhi-to-hit-campaign-trail-in-kerala-in-early-may/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/sonia-modi-m.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">PM Modi, Sonia to hit campaign trail in Kerala in early May</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/kerala-cm-confident-of-good-working-relationship-with-centre/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/06/chandy-s.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Kerala CM confident of good working relationship with Centre</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/media-covering-only-modis-rallies-ignoring-cong-cms/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/m_id_444734_shakeel_ahmed.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">&#039;Media covering only Modi&#039;s rallies,ignoring Cong CMs&#039;</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Congress, the CPM and the BJP have left the Kuttanad seat to allies, which has turned the outcome unpredictable. The UDF nominee, Jacob Abraham, is considered the best among the candidates for his work as a panchayat member in the region. However, his party, the Kerala Congress group led by K M Mani, is yet to recover from the bar-bribe taint. Informed sources also hinted that the Congress, which had eyed the seat, was not too keen on Abraham.</p>\n<p>The NDA candidate is Subhash Vasu, national secretary of the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), a political outfit formed by SNDP leader Vellapally Natesan, with the hope of drawing in the support of the numerically powerful Ezhava community. Vasu has drawn on the extensive SNDP network, and, with the help of the RSS cadre, is running a well-oiled campaign in the constituency. He also claims to be the front-runner.</p>\n<p>The incumbent MLA is a colourful character representing Sharad Pawar\u2019s NCP, a constituent of the LDF. Thomas Chandy or \u2018Kuwait\u2019 Chandy, the second richest candidate in the state with a net worth of nearly Rs 100 crore, is known to be large-hearted in helping the \u2018needy\u2019 through his Daveed Putra Charitable Foundation. With no history of political activism, he had been parachuted into Kuttanad as a nominee of the late Congress leader K Karunakaran\u2019s short-lived political outfit, DIC(K), in 2006. When Karunakaran returned to the Congress, Thomas Chandy found a home in the NCP, a party which comes alive in Kerala mainly during elections. Riding on the CPM cadre strength, Thomas Chandy won the seat for the LDF in 2011. Critics though allege that he spends half the month in Kuwait and is more focussed on his businesses in the Middle-East than the constituency\u2019s needs. Even they, however, grudgingly admit that Thomas has charmed his constituents with his purse and is tough to defeat.</p>\n<p>The NCP can\u2019t boast of cadre in Kuttanad, but Thomas Chandy is omnipresent \u2014 on flexboards, banners and even on the back of autorickshaws. Last heard, he was assuring a small gathering in Nedumudi that NCP leaders have declared him as their nominee in the LDF ministry.</p>\n<p>There is, however, unease about Chandy and his \u2018charity\u2019 politics, even among the CPM cadre. A CPM worker said his willingness to fund all party programmes have turned the organisation slothful and dependent. A senior party leader blamed the compulsions of coalition politics for the presence of candidates like Thomas Chandy. The cynicism among the electorate for the MLA is being tapped by the BDJS candidate.</p>\n<p>On the sidelines of a village gathering at Ramankari, a hamlet on the Pamba, the BDJS\u2019 Vasu says he is confident of victory. \u201cIn an electorate of 1.63 lakh voters, only 51,000 are Christians. Even if they don\u2019t vote for me, I\u2019ll win,\u201d he says. He is banking on a tight three-corned contest in which a candidate with about 40,000 plus votes might win. The BJP-BDJS candidates had won over 25,000 votes from two panchayats in Kuttanad in the local bodies election last year. A subtle hint in Vasu\u2019s comment is that he will be able to consolidate the one lakh plus Hindu vote in the constituency, which has been represented only by upper caste Christians for decades. Not surprisingly, Vasu\u2019s main target is the CPM, which he claims, is known in the constituency to be on Thomas Chandy\u2019s payroll.</p>\n<p>Hindus in Kuttanad, like elsewhere in Kerala, are hardly a monolith. In this region, however, the Nair-Ezhava divide was more pronounced until recently, with the latter forming the bedrock of the CPM and a small section of the Nairs supporting the RSS. The bloody RSS-CPM conflicts in the region until the \u201880s also had a caste undercurrent. The BJP-BDJS alliance hopes to overcome the Nair-Ezhava divide and refashion political preferences along communal lines.</p>\n<p>Natesan, the brain behind the BDJS, which was formed earlier this year, claims the BJP\u2019s alliance with his party has turned the NDA politically relevant. The BDJS is contesting in 37 of the total 140 constituencies. Sitting in his sprawling residence at Kanichukulangara, a village on the Alappuzha-Kochi highway, Natesan says the LDF and the UDF have ignored the concerns of Hindus to appease the minority communities.</p>\n<p>But few buy Natesan\u2019s claim that he can facilitate a shift of Ezhava votes to the NDA. Senior CPM leader Thomas Isaac says it is only the creamy layer of the Ezhava community that supports Natesan and may vote for the BDJS. Suresh, a political observer in Kollam, says the BDJS could hurt both fronts. The micro finance schemes run by the SNDP, according to him, could tap three to four thousand votes in every constituency for the BDJS. Venu, who has tracked many elections in Alappuzha, was more sceptical about the impact of the new front and said many SNDP functionaries are also office-bearers of the CPM and are unlikely to facilitate the vote transfer Natesan seeks.</p>\n<p>In a way, the BDJS is a throwback to the \u201870s when the SNDP floated a political outfit called SRP (Socialist Republican Party) and the Nair Service Society had the NDP. Both managed to be part of the UDF, but failed to gain traction and folded soon. The BDJS-BJP alliance is also reminiscent of the Hindu Mahamandalam that NSS leader Mannathu Padmanabhan and SNDP chief R Sankar attempted in the early \u201850s.</p>\n<p>The communal identity paradigm of these experiments proved unsuitable to the political climate of Kerala. The big question now is if the ground has shifted in favour of identity politics that seek to tap Hindu anxieties about the economic and political empowerment of Muslims and Christians in the state. The future of the BDJS \u2014 in fact, the entire political spectrum \u2014 depends on that.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795988&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-elections-2016-breaking-new-ground-in-kerala-backwaters-hindu-front-hopes-to-drop-anchor-2795988/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kerala-backwaters-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kerala-backwaters-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kerala backwaters 480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kerala-backwaters-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kerala, kerala backwaters,  Kuttanad,triangular contest at Kuttanad, NDA, narendra modi, modi rally, edathua rally, modi rally in edathua, oommen chandy, hindu, muslim, christians, kerala hindu, kerala muslim, kerala christians, pamba distributaries, UDF, LDF, indian express news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Nepal is becoming like Kashmir with anti-India feelings: Nishikant Dubey</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/nepal-is-becoming-like-kashmir-with-anti-india-feelings-nishikant-dubey-bjp-2795978/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/nepal-is-becoming-like-kashmir-with-anti-india-feelings-nishikant-dubey-bjp-2795978/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 03:14:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 03:14:49 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Shalini Nair]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795978</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Nishikant Dubey, BJP MP from Godda, speaks to The Indian Express on demand for India-Nepal border fencing.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795978&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2795989 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/dubey.jpg\" alt=\"india nepal, nepal india, indo nepal relations, Nishikant Dubey, BJP MP, BJP MP from Godda, 5 questions indian express, indian express news\" /> Nishikant Dubey, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> MP from Godda.\n<p><strong>Why India must secure its borders with Nepal?</strong></p>\n<p>Under the 1950 India-Nepal treaty, we allowed people from Nepal to freely enter our country and take up jobs here. Since then, Naxalism has emerged as a big issue, and the corridor from Pashupati in Nepal to Tirupati in India is a belt of mines and minerals. Due to the porous border with Nepal, countries like China and Pakistan, and agencies like ISI have explored that route. Nepal is becoming like <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/\">Kashmir</a> with anti-India sentiments brewing within. We should fence the border like we have done with Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you blame the Gandhis for ties with Nepal turning sour?</strong></p>\n<p>In 1986-87, (the then PM) Rajiv Gandhi imposed a blockade on Nepal for three months and ensured that no water, salt or oil reached the Himalayan country. Between 1971 and 1975, (then PM) Indira (Gandhi) never took Nepal into confidence on the Bangladesh issue, nor when Sikkim was merged into our territory. The same is true of Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s policies during India\u2019s war with China in 1962. This is why Nepal feels that India is unjust towards it.</p>\n<p><strong>The Opposition has blamed <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> for the situation with Nepal.</strong></p>\n<p>All this didn\u2019t happen in one day. Nepal was a Hindu nation that became a secular country. Modi is the first Indian PM to visit Nepal in a very long time since he wanted to maintain good ties with the country. People there also welcomed him. But over the years, the relations have deteriorated so badly that it cannot be mended in a day.</p>\n<p><strong>Nepal\u2019s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli also has accused India of trying to destabilise his government.</strong></p>\n<p>He is the eighth prime minister Nepal has got since the end of monarchy there. Nepal is trying to blame India for its internal turmoil.</p>\n<p><strong>Didn\u2019t it all start go downhill after India tried to dictate terms during the drafting of Nepal\u2019s Constitution last year?</strong></p>\n<p>Nepal shares its border with us, and over the years the country has been responsible for fuelling agitation among its Madheshi population there. It is a matter of concern for us. Any law and order situation there will mean pan inflow of refugees to India and it will then be our responsibility.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

The order of revocation has to be placed before the apex court on Friday.</p>\n<p>Rawat\u2019s counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal appreciated the Centre\u2019s stand on revocation of the proclamation. \u201cIt is a very fair stand and we appreciate the learned AG for making a statement on revocation of President\u2019s rule,\u201d said the lawyers.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttarakhand-harish-rawat-government-wins-floor-test-revoke-presidents-rule-2794699/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/live-uttarakhand-floor-test-congress-bjp-harish-rawat-2792780/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/ukd-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Uttarakhand: Harish Rawat has won, will revoke President&#039;s Rule today, Centre tells SC</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttarakhand-crisis-centre-seeks-2-days-to-decide-on-floor-test-2785025/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/supreme-court-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Uttarakhand crisis: Centre seeks two days to \u2018seriously consider\u2019 floor test</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/uttarakhand-crisis-president-rule-harish-rawat-narendra-modi-2764551/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/uttarakhand-high-court-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">The right reply</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttarakhand-crisis-high-court-defers-hearing-plea-of-rebel-cong-mlas-to-april-18/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/harish-rawat480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Uttarakhand HC defers hearing plea of rebel Congress MLAs to April 18</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/harish-rawat-presidents-rule-in-uttarakahnd-hc-rejects-centres-plea-for-adjournment/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/harish-rawat21.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">President&#039;s rule in Uttarakhand:  HC rejects Centre&#039;s plea for adjournment</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/uttarakhand-assembly-floor-test-high-court-stay-order/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/harish-rawat-4801.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">High Court stays Uttarakhand assembly floor test till April 7</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The hearing on Wednesday had started with the AG making a suo motu statement: \u201cI have received the instructions.

It\u2019s hardly a secret that barring in wheat or paddy, no major yield breakthrough has been achieved by Indian scientists for over two decades. This is more so in pulses, oilseeds and high-value agriculture sectors like horticulture, dairy and poultry.</p>\n<p>Dramatic productivity gains in major cereals during the seventies and eighties were made possible mainly through technology sharing by non-profit international research bodies, such as CIMMYT (the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, Mexico) and the International Rice Research Institute in Manila. While our scientists improved many of the genetic lines sourced from these centres and adapted them to the country\u2019s huge diversity of agro-climatic conditions, the original strains and the science behind them were, however, developed in foreign labs before they could support technology in Indian fields.</p>\n<p>It was this international cooperation between government, non-government and research bodies that enabled Indian farmers, at least in the better resource-endowed regions, to achieve significant productivity breakthroughs in wheat and rice. By the early 1990s, India was self-sufficient in foodgrain production.</p>\n<p><b><div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/a-solution-towards-addressing-the-farm-technology-drought-2795939/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/why-popcorn-maize-isnt-a-hit-with-farmers/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/10/popcorn-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Why popcorn maize isn\u2019t a hit with farmers</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/world/indians-abroad/india-born-scientist-sanjaya-rajaram-named-winner-of-2014-world-food-prize/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/06/rajaram-209.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">India-born scientist Sanjaya Rajaram named winner of 2014 World Food Prize</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/as-farmers-give-new-technologies-a-miss-water-levels-keep-falling/\"><span class=\"text\">As farmers give new technologies a miss,water levels keep falling</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-green-signal/\"><span class=\"text\">The green signal</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/as-good-as-msp-gets/\"><span class=\"text\">As good as MSP gets</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/record-wheat-harvest-ahead-this-rabi-season-says-agri-expert/\"><span class=\"text\">Record wheat harvest ahead this rabi season,says agri expert</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</b></p>\n<p>Recapitulating this history is important in the context of the on-going dispute with Monsanto because it reveals how the then government clearly differentiated between strategy and tactics. The reflexive anti-US and anti-MNC sentiment, prevalent\u00a0among influential sections of academia, civil society and the media, apart from bureaucratic and political circles here, wasn\u2019t any weaker then than now. Yet, the political leadership stared down a shrill campaign to block the import of a small quantity of breeder seeds of dwarf wheat varieties for multiplication in India; from its standpoint, the larger strategic objective of food security was more important than any short-term tactical loss of support among key support bases.</p>\n<p>Ending dependence on food aid was given higher priority than pandering to fears regarding destruction of indigenous bio-diversity or loss of seed sovereignty.</p>\n<p>In the instant case, more than one senior agricultural scientist has confirmed to this writer that Monsanto had originally made an offer for an outright transfer of its Bt gene technology to the Centre for a one-time payment in single-digit million US dollars. The Centre could, then, allow any public or private entity to produce cotton seeds incorporating this technology at a fixed royalty. In retrospect, this may have been a major missed opportunity.</p>\n<p>The Monsanto offer was made sometime in the mid-1990s, but a combination of scientific pride and bureaucratic caution seemingly ensured that it never got beyond a few conversations. Monsanto subsequently licensed the technology to a joint venture with a private Indian seed company.</p>\n<p>The commercial royalty levied on this technology lies at the heart of the current dispute with some of the sub-licensee firms that have incorporated it into their own cotton hybrids. With various courts and the Competition Commission of India, too, getting involved, we\u2019ll have to wait and see how the issue gets resolved.</p>\n<p>However, the larger question \u2014 of accessing cutting-edge technology, spanning crop husbandry and even high-value agriculture \u2014 remains unanswered. Frequent technology upgrades are critical to attain the ambitious vision of doubling farm incomes by 2022. Can it be done without seeking technology from outside? The answer is an unequivocal no.</p>\n<p>The approach to acquiring critical agricultural technology could follow the pattern emerging in another area of strategic importance: Defence. To provide the armed forces with cutting-edge capabilities, the Centre is today taking the lead for identifying proprietary technologies and negotiating their transfer to Indian entities (often from one foreign private company to an Indian one), so that the necessary platforms (guns, tanks, fighter jets, warships etc.) are manufactured in India.</p>\n<p>Technology for agriculture needs to be approached in a similar manner. Let the Niti Aayog list critical gaps in our agri technology portfolio and fill a priority list with outright import and adaptation of on-the-shelf technologies from anywhere in the world. The Centre can negotiate the purchase of the identified technologies, using government-to-government purchase mechanisms similar to those in defence acquisitions. This will greatly reduce the commercial complexity of such buy-outs, with the Centre holding the rights to domestically license a range of technologies at reasonable rates of royalty (or even zero where warranted, such as in pulses).</p>\n<p>But why not simply liberalise flows of planting material or germplasm from abroad and allow private entities to enter into tie-ups of their choosing? Well, the chances are we will run into a hundred Monsanto-type problems.</p>\n<p>The political economy of agriculture now will not permit market forces to have free play; the temptation for state agents to influence economic decisions would remain a threat to businesses in the near term. Only when this situation has improved over a decade or so, and market-determined pricing for inputs becomes accepted practice, can one realistically expect agricultural technology liberalisation in the full sense.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795939&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/a-solution-towards-addressing-the-farm-technology-drought-2795939/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/farm-small1.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/farm-small1.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">farm-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b79f669bb80e3de68460b2235b5e7285?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">maneeshkarki</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/farm1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">It\u2019s hardly a secret that barring in wheat or paddy, no major yield breakthrough has been achieved by Indian scientists for over two decades.</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Beyond Bihar: Nitish in Varanasi today, may push for liquor ban in UP</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/beyond-bihar-nitish-in-varanasi-today-may-push-for-liquor-ban-in-up-2795956/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/beyond-bihar-nitish-in-varanasi-today-may-push-for-liquor-ban-in-up-2795956/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 02:46:11 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 02:46:11 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Santosh Singh]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795956</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Nitish seems to have chosen the venue to send a symbolic message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who represents the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795956&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2767502\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/nitish-7591.jpg\" alt=\"nitish kumar, bihar government, bihar liquor ban, liquor ban, liquor ban in Uttar pradesh, bihar CM, uttarakhand government, uttar pradesh liquor ban, indian express news, liquor ban news\" /> Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.

I hope the Centre will find solutions to the vexed questions of Uttarakhand. We are a small state but our aspirations are big. We have to fill the gap between akanksha (aspirations) and apeksha (expectations) and for that we need the Centre\u2019s support,\u201d said Rawat, as celebrating party workers splashed colour on each other outside his residence.</p>\n<p>On his list of people to thank were <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/\">Sonia Gandhi</a> and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a>, Ambika Soni and Mayawati, whom he thanked profusely for her crucial support that gave them the edge in the floor test.</p>\n<p>On the question of whether his doors were open for the rebel Congress leaders, Rawat said, \u201cOnce a chapter ends, you should leave it at that. I have done a lot of tapasya these two months to get these results, now it is for them to do some tapasya. Let the BJP also know what it is to deal with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amidst speculation that the Congress would call for early elections as they have the people\u2019s sympathy right now, Rawat said that development, not political gains, was on his mind. \u201cUttarakhand has suffered a lot in these months. If you were to ask me, the compelling situation in the state demands we focus on carrying out development work first,\u201d he said. Rawat was expected to hold a cabinet meeting later in the day.</p>\n<p>Rawat was also summoned by the CBI in the purported sting case in Delhi, but said he had requested them to question him in Dehradun. \u201cThe CBI asked me first to appear a day before the floor test, which wasn\u2019t possible, and now tomorrow.

This is something which individuals don\u2019t decide.\u201d She said the party will discuss all the possibilities with the state leadership.</p>\n<p>Congress Working Committee member Anil Shastri did not hedge his bets, and categorically stated, \u201cRawat must go for fresh elections. He will win hands down. If elections are held immediately, the Uttarakhand electorate will make <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> bite the dust.\u201d</p>\n<p>Several senior leaders said the party\u2019s assessment is that there is a sentiment in favour of Rawat, especially among his Thakur community, which comprises nearly half the state\u2019s electorate. \u201cThe Thakur community\u2019s vote is very significant and is the deciding factor. And there is huge sympathy in the community in favour of Rawat, although it is up to him to take a final call,\u201d a senior leader said.</p>\n<p>Rawat, of course, will closely watch the CBI inquiry against him in the sting operation case. \u201cOn the face of it, we feel the CBI will go after him,\u201d another senior Congress leader said. \u201cThe BJP government will not let this issue die down. He may wait to see which way the investigation proceeds before taking a call.\u201d</p>\n<p>Many leaders feel Rawat should face the polls now, riding on the momentum generated by a mass contact campaign he and the party had undertaken to protest against President\u2019s Rule, rather than wait till the assembly runs its term, by which time some of the momentum might be lost. But the party will first try and get a sense of its remaining MLAs, leaders said \u2014 since the party does not have a majority on its own, the view of allies will also matter.</p>\n<p>While 10 Congress MLAs have switched sides, the party has not suffered a split or major erosion in its ranks even in the constituencies of these MLAs.</p>\n<p>Soni congratulated the party MLAs for \u201cstanding together firmly with deep conviction\u201d and for not allowing \u201cfloor crossing to take place\u201d. The party, she said, \u201chas fought back&#8230;the BJP did not stop short at anything. The allurements which were offered, according to our MLAs&#8230;some said they threatened with ED, IT, and IB&#8230; Some of our MLAs were really financially vulnerable..they come from far-flung areas, and they still resisted (money).\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS

On the same day, the CBI had moved an application seeking to interrogate Rai inside the prison for two days.</p>\n<p>During the last hearing on May 9, the court had reprimanded and directed the Thane prison superintendent to ensure that Rai was produced in court \u201canyhow\u201d. Rai\u2019s application to the court seeking to be made approver is dated April 29.</p>\n<p>Rai\u2019s lawyer Shrinivas Bhave said he was unaware about the application or his desire to turn approver, till he learnt of it in the court Wednesday. Bhave also said while Rai had not been produced before the court since March, he had also not met him in prison.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Rai was brought to the court along with the three other accused, Indrani Mukerjea, her husband Peter Mukerjea and former husband Sanjeev Khanna. The judge asked Rai to be brought to the witness box and asked if he had sent the application from the jail. Rai said he was seeking pardon and had forwarded an application through the jail superintendent. </p>\n<p>The court then asked him why the application was made and how he was aware of the crime that he was wishing to reveal details of. \u201cMain jahaan murder hua tha, wahaan par tha. (I was there when the murder took place),\u201d Rai told the court.</p>\n<p>In his submission recorded in the court, Rai said, \u201cI am ready to disclose entire facts and circumstances of which I am aware&#8230;being a participant in the commission of the crime, that is the killing of Sheena Bora by strangulation.\u201d He further said he would make himself available as a witness before the court.</p>\n<p>On being asked why he was making such a plea, Rai said he was repenting the act. \u201cPaschatap hua,\u201d he said. Special Judge H S Mahajan also asked him if he was making the submission under any pressure or if anybody had lured him with a monetary offer. \u201cOn making inquiry and verifying, accused number 3 (Rai) has said that he made the submission voluntarily without any pressure, instigation, fear or for reward,\u201d the court recorded.</p>\n<p>Further, the CBI was asked for its response to the request made by Rai. The agency has sought time till May 17. The court has directed the Thane prison superintendent to ensure Rai is produced before court during the next hearing without fail. If he becomes an approver in the case, Rai would have to do so under Section 306 read with Section 307 of the CrPC. It would require him to make a full and complete disclosure about the crime, which could be used against his accomplices during the trial.</p>\n<p>Rai had earlier made a confessional statement under Section 164 of the CrPC. A CBI official said it would be the court\u2019s prerogative to decide on whether the confessional statement would be referred to or a fresh statement recorded if the CBI decided to allow him turn an approver. </p>\n<p>During the course of the investigation, according to the police, Rai had said it was Indrani who approached him to participate in the murder in lieu of money. Rai had also claimed to have accompanied Indrani to Raigad days before the murder to recce the spot for dumping the body and had also helped Indrani and Khanna eventually dispose of Sheena\u2019s body a day after the murder on April 24, 2012.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794942&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sheena-bora-murder-case-indranis-former-driver-wants-to-turn-approver-2794942/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/indrani-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/indrani-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">indrani 480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/17785f3ebe9c18421c5f0c2fe81c6aec?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">abhimanyuchakra</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/indrani-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Sheena Bora, Indrani mukerjea, sheena murder case, sheena bora murder, indrani driver, sheena murder news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Kashmir: Ex-militant injured in bear attack</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/liaquat-hussain-shah-bear-attack-ex-militant-injured-in-bear-attack-2795867/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/liaquat-hussain-shah-bear-attack-ex-militant-injured-in-bear-attack-2795867/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 01:16:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 01:16:54 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Bashaarat Masood]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795867</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Shah, who had crossed over to Pakistan in 1993 for arms training, was arrested by Delhi Police in 2013 when he was returning to Kashmir via Nepal under the J&#38;K government\u2019s rehabilitation plan.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795867&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2795871\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/liaquat.jpg\" alt=\"Liaquat Shah was attacked by a bear outside his house.\" /> Liaquat Shah was attacked by a bear outside his house.\n<p>Liaquat Hussain Shah, the 57-year-old former militant whose return from Pakistan and arrest by the Special Cell of Delhi Police made headlines, was injured in a bear attack on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Shah, a resident of Dardpora village of Kupwara\u2019s Lolab valley, had left home to graze cattle.

However, slowly I felt that the students\u2019 union was effectively hijacked by JAC to mount continuous attack on selected persons. On one hand, the JAC demands justice for Rohith, but it does not cooperate in an inquiry conducted by a judicial commission,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe leaders of the JAC and SFI make serious allegations against certain professors, which are actively supported by faculty who have vested interests, but do not come forward either to prove the allegations or hold discussions to solve the problem,\u2019\u2019 Sahu alleged.</p>\n<p>Claiming that Rohith, who was active in the SFI for sometime, probably felt isolated, Sahu wrote that his own alienation was \u201capparently driving\u201d him towards \u201cthe unfortunate path undertaken by Rohith\u201d.</p>\n<p>About Rohith, he further added: \u201cHe was disillusioned, and went on to join Ambedkar Student Association (ASA). It was very unfortunate that he believed in radical methods to achieve justice for the poor. According to me, the SFI nurtured the feelings of hatred in him&#8230;\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p>Sahu also demanded that the inflow of funds to the JAC and its spending should either be investigated or made public.</p>\n<p>\u201cDaily rent of tent is around five thousand and three months have passed already. Lavish food was served for more than ten days to the students\u2019 community free of cost. Largescale events got organised. Certain individual members of the movement are having lavish parties daily&#8230; As a participant of the movement, I confirm that massive funds are flowing and I am keen to know the source,\u2019\u2019 said Sahu, who actively participated in the JAC protests earlier.</p>\n<p>He also accused SFI and JAC of misguiding students with \u201cimaginary\u201d tales of discrimination.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Adithya Harish, the SFI president in the university, condemned Sahu\u2019s remarks and accused him of maligning the movement to seek justice for Rohith.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795791&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/rohith-vemula-suicide-hyderabad-university-2795791/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/hu-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/hu-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">hu-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b79f669bb80e3de68460b2235b5e7285?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">maneeshkarki</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>UK refuses to deport Vijay Mallya, govt says it will try extradition route</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/vijay-mallya-deportation-uk-latest-news-2794472/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/vijay-mallya-deportation-uk-latest-news-2794472/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 01:00:26 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 08:24:18 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794472</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[UK realises gravity of allegations, keen to help India: MEA<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794472&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2748912 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/vijay-mallya-m.jpg\" alt=\"Vijay Mallya, Vijay Mallya news, Vijay Mallya in UK, Mallya UK, Mallya deportation, UK Mallya extradition, Mallya news, Mallya UK, Vijay Mallya deportation, Vijay mallya news\" /> Liquor baron\u00a0Vijay Mallya\n<p>The United Kingdom has told India that it cannot deport liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who is facing money laundering charges in the country, but could consider an extradition request for him, the Ministry of External Affairs said Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The UK government\u2019s response came nearly a fortnight after India made a request for the deportation of Mallya, whose Indian passport was revoked in a bid to secure his presence for investigation against him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002.

(Express Photo)\n<p>Expressing \u201coptimism\u201d about improvement in ties with India, Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit Wednesday said \u201cone can never lose hope\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cMany things have been spoken again and again. There are some accepted ground realities. Still, chances are always there for improvement in the ties. As a diplomat I am very optimistic,\u201d said Basit, who was accompanied by his wife Summiya to a visit to the Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS) to deliver a talk on \u201cPakistan-India Relations: The Current Situation\u201d here at the sprawling Rashtrapati Niwas, formerly known as Viceregal Lodge.</p>\n<p>\u201cDiplomats never lose hope and while standing at such a historic place &#8211; Shimla, the summer capital of British India that has been witness to a series of pre- and post-Independence dialogues &#8211; one can\u2019t give up hope,\u201d he told <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Read |\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/waiting-for-indias-signal-on-dialogue-pak-envoy-abdul-basit-2792596/\">Waiting for India\u2019s signal on dialogue: Pak envoy Abdul\u00a0Basit</a></strong></p>\n<p>Earlier, while interacting with scholars, including IIAS director Dr Chetan Singh, the High Commissioner said the process of dialogue between the two countries has \u201csuffered a blow\u201d after the terrorist attack on Pathankot air base but \u201cstill things are not so bad\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt (dialogue) got stalled following the Pathankot incident. However, an important thing that happened this time was that reaction from both the sides was not strong as had been the case during earlier attacks. There are good chances of engagement between the two countries in the process of dialogue,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Basit suggested that India \u201cmove forward\u201d with its investigation in the 2007 Samjhauta Express blast case.</p>\n<p>Replying to questions raised by the scholars and IIAS fellows, Basit said \u201cpeople to people contact\u201d was the best way to bring some kind of stability in the relations. In fact, there is a strong need to create a mechanism so that any unforeseen happening doesn\u2019t derail the process of dialogue, he said. \u201cSome basic certainty in the relations between the two countries is of paramount importance.\u201d</p>\n<p>On suggestion from an IIAS fellow, Bettina Baurmer, the High Commissioner agreed to promote \u201cinter-faith dialogue\u201d between the two neighbouring countries. Basit also stressed on the need to promote economic and trade relations, apart from welcoming artists in India and Pakistan.</p>\n<p>Basit earlier took a stroll at the lawns of IIAS and spoke favourably about the state. \u201cI wish Shimla continued to remain a summer capital of India. This place is such an impressive hill station,\u201d he said as he observed the architecture of the Rashtrapati Niwas, built in 1888, while being accompanied by IIAS director and other senior officials of the institute.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS

It allowed the revenue deparment\u2019s appeal against orders of Bombay High Court and Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which had struck down the CIT\u2019s order.</p>\n<p>By filing a re-revised I-T return in 2003, Bachchan had claimed additional expenses to the tune of 30 per cent of his gross professional receipts (Rs 3.17 crore). Explaining the claim, he had told the assessing officer that the money was spent on security since \u201che has to protect himself from various threats to his life&#8230; and to avoid extortion of money from gangsters\u201d. While not disclosing details of security agencies on ground of personal safety, he had said the payments were made out of cash balances available.</p>\n<p>Later, he sought to withdraw the claim. When the assessing officer asked him why the expenses claimed should not be treated as unexplained expenditure, he said he was wrongly advised in making the claim as a standard deduction and that since he had now himself chosen to withdraw it, Rs 3.17 crore need not be treated as his income for such financial year. The assessing officer accepted the reply and dropped the matter, but CIT reopened it, saying the case required further probe.</p>\n<p>Saying that it \u201cwholly\u201d agrees with CIT\u2019s view, the bench held: \u201cMaking a claim which would prima facie disclose that the expenses in respect of which deduction has been claimed has been incurred and thereafter abandoning/withdrawing the same gives rise to the necessity of further enquiry in the interest of the Revenue. The notice issued under Section 69-C of the Act could not have been simply dropped on the ground that the claim has been withdrawn.\u201d It revived CIT\u2019s order of revised assessment in March 2006 by which the previous tax assessment was set aside. Subsequently a fresh tax liability was arrived at by order in December 2006 and the bench has now said this re-assessment order could be challenged by Bachchan, \u201cif he is so inclined and so advised\u201d.</p>\n<p>Reacting to the order, Bachchan\u2019s chartered accountants and legal advisory team said the case has not been re-opened and that the actor has been given the right to appeal against the re-assessment order.</p>\n<p>A statement released by his legal team said, &#8220;The case has not been reopened and also the case has no relation to KBC (Kaun Banega Crorepati) whatsoever in any matter or context.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It also said the apex court has given Bachchan &#8220;the right to appeal against the re-assessment order&#8221;.</p>\n<p><em>(With inputs from Sonup Sahadevan)</em></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795589&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sc-allows-fresh-assessment-of-amitabh-bachchans-tax-liability-2795589/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/amitabh-12001.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/amitabh-12001.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">amitabh 1200</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/435232d9d6e68bceac465179e73e0dbf?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kris1290</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/amitabh-7591.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">amitabh bachchan, amitabh tax issue, panama papers, amitabh panama papers, bachchan panama papers, business news, india news, amitabh income tax, amitabh bachchan income tax</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Never met Sonia, Manmohan or Antony, Gautam Khaitan \u2018responsible for moving money\u2019, says &#8216;middleman&#8217; Christian Michel</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agustawestland-sonia-gandhi-manmohan-singh-ak-antony-congress-christian-michel-2794969/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agustawestland-sonia-gandhi-manmohan-singh-ak-antony-congress-christian-michel-2794969/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:50:03 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:55:07 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794969</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Michel said that BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has not lied about the deal but it seems he has been misled.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794969&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2775560 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/agustawestland_chopper_deal.jpg\" alt=\"sonia gandhi, agustawestland, manmohan singh, ak antony, congress, agustawestland congress, agustawestland scam, india news\" /> &#8220;No, never,&#8221; was the prompt reply of Michel when he was asked whether he had ever met Gandhi, Singh or the then Defence Minister A K Antony for pushing the AgustaWestland deal.\n<p>CHRISTIAN MICHEL, alleged middleman in the VVIP chopper deal, said on Wednesday that he \u201cprobably met\u201d former IAF chief S P Tyagi at Delhi\u2019s Gymkhana Club. He added that he never met <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> president <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/\">Sonia Gandhi</a>, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or former Defence Minister A K Antony.</p>\n<p>\u201cI probably met ex-Air chief S P Tyagi in Gymkhana Club. And I think I shook his hand there. But because of his association with (Guido) Haschke, I really avoided him,\u201d said Michel in an interview to India Today news channel in Abu Dhabi.</p>\n<p>When asked whether he had met top Congress leaders, he said, \u201cNo, never\u201d. \u201cI have never met Sonia Gandhi, never met Manmohan Singh or A K Antony. Congress never interfered in Agusta deal. I avoid meeting leaders, my expertise is implementation,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Denying any wrongdoing on his part, Michel said he couldn\u2019t be sure that kickbacks were not paid, and sought to blame lawyer Gautam Khaitan, and the other alleged middlemen Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa. \u201cI cannot say there were no (kickbacks)&#8230; Gautam Khaitan is certainly the brain behind the scandal. He was responsible for moving the money. He knows everything,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p><b><div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agustawestland-sonia-gandhi-manmohan-singh-ak-antony-congress-christian-michel-2794969/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/efforts-were-made-by-previous-upa-govt-to-favour-agustawestland-parrikar-in-lok-sabha/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/parrikar-ls-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Parrikar rejects Congress demand for SC probe, says will track payoffs</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/congress-stoutly-defends-sonia-gandhi-demands-sc-monitored-probe-in-vvip-chopper-deal-2787629/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/sonia-scindia-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Sonia a &#039;sherni&#039;, will make you repent: Scindia leads Congress charge</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sp-tyagi-couldnt-have-acted-alone-in-agustawestland-chopper-scam-vk-singh-2782901/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/v-k-singh-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">SP Tyagi couldn&#039;t have acted alone in AgustaWestland chopper scam: VK Singh</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/vvip-chopper-scam-agusta-westland-vk-singh-2774684/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/vk-singh480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">VVIP Chopper deal: India has approached UK for extradition of middleman, says govt</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/fam-in-middlemens-papers-refer-to-tyagi-brothers-antony-tells-rs/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/helsmall.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">&#039;FAM&#039; in middlemen\u2019s papers refer to Tyagi brothers, Antony tells RS</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/does-ap-mean-ahmed-patel-asks-prosecutor-in-italy-court-middleman-says-dont-know/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/chopper-thumb.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Does AP mean Ahmed Patel, asks prosecutor in Italy court; middleman says don&#039;t know</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</b></p>\n<p>He said he wasn\u2019t keen on the Tyagi brothers as he always suspected Haschke. \u201cI was introduced to Julie Tyagi as a powerful industrialist. Julie is a very nice man. He didn\u2019t promise me any deal. I was very nervous of them,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Asked if S P Tyagi played an instrumental part in the deal, Michel replied: \u201cI think Tyagi was used as a tool for Haschke to get inside AgustaWestland. I don\u2019t think he can play any major role.\u201d Attempting to clear top leaders in the Congress and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>, he said: \u201cI think Indian leaders did their job. But to say that a man like (A B) Vajpayee, Dr Manmohan Singh or A K Antony is involved is ridiculous. No one would believe that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Michel also said he was ready to be interviewed and examined by CBI and ED, which are probing the case, but he would not come to India as it could take more than 25 years to clear his name. He said the agencies could approach him through the Indian High Commission in UAE and he would cooperate. \u201cVideo-conferencing is also a good way to go about it,\u201d said Michel.</p>\n<p>Both the CBI and ED have made it clear that they want Michel to come to India and join the investigation.</p>\n<p>Michel also made a mention of BJP Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy, who he described as his father Wolfgang Michel\u2019s \u201cgood friend\u201d. He said he was shocked to see Swamy attacking his father, who, he claimed, had close relations with various political leaders in India.</p>\n<p>He said Swamy had been misled about the deal. \u201cHe has authenticated (documents) what was given in the CAG report&#8230; They (CAG) are not aviation experts and they are bureaucrats asked to put together document way beyond their expertise. So he was misled by his own documentation,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The ED is reported to have found that Michel\u2019s driver, Narayan Bahadur, was still receiving payments through overseas wire service from him. Asked whether the money was meant for somebody else, Michel said it was \u201cfor him\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe (Bahadur) is my driver. I know him. He is my dear friend. I hope and have full intention to keep him rest of my life. He has been with me for years and years. I am going to bring him to Dubai and look after him,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Michel also said that though he had many journalist friends in India, none had been paid any money, nor had anyone ever demanded any money.</p>\n<p>Earlier, Michel\u2019s lawyer had said he was ready to come to India and face investigators provided he gets an assurance that he will not be arrested.</p>\n<p>Michel is one of three alleged middlemen whom the Indian investigating agencies suspect to have brokered the chopper deal in favour of AgustaWestland.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n<p>[youtube <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794969&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agustawestland-sonia-gandhi-manmohan-singh-ak-antony-congress-christian-michel-2794969/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/agustawestland-deal-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/agustawestland-deal-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">agustawestland-deal-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/agustawestland_chopper_deal.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">sonia gandhi, agustawestland, manmohan singh, ak antony, congress, agustawestland congress, agustawestland scam, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>BSP will not opt for poll alliance in any state: Mayawati</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttarakhand-uttar-pradesh-elections-bsp-will-not-opt-for-poll-alliance-in-any-state-mayawati-2795819/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttarakhand-uttar-pradesh-elections-bsp-will-not-opt-for-poll-alliance-in-any-state-mayawati-2795819/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:47:19 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:47:19 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795819</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Talking to reporters in Delhi and in a subsequent party statement on the matter, Mayawati said BSP will contest the coming Assembly polls in UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab \u201calone\u201d and \u201con its own\u201d.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795819&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2583217\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/mayawati-759.jpg\" alt=\"mayawati, BSP, uttarakhand, mayawati eye on uttarakhand, uttra pradesh elections, harish rawat, indian express news\" /> BSP Chief Mayawati\n<p>BSP chief Mayawati Wednesday said that her party will not have any alliance or understanding with any party in the assembly elections in any state, including Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

USL had also approached a local court, citing provisions in the Portuguese Civil Code to block auction of the property in the past.</p>\n<p>There was a delay on part of the collector in allowing takeover of the property, which made SBICAPS approach the Goa Bench of Bombay High Court. The bench granted three months to the collector to complete the hearing of application filed by the consortium of banks seeking possession of the villa.</p>\n<p>So far, the banks have recovered over Rs 1,400 crore by selling shares and collaterals and over Rs 1,200 crore is blocked in escrow accounts at Debt Recovery Tribunal, Bengaluru and the Karnataka High Court. Mallya had told the Supreme Court he was ready to repay up to Rs 6,800 crore of the total dues of over Rs 9,400 crore.</p>\n<p>Last month, the consortium of banks had failed in its attempt to sell Kingfisher Airline&#8217;s erstwhile headquarters Kingfisher House in Mumbai because of the high reserve price of Rs 150 crore.</p>\n<p>Attempts to sell the Kingfisher brands and associated trademarks carrying a reserve price of Rs 367 crore had also found no takers.</p>\n<p>Mallya left the country on March 2 for London. Earlier this week, the Government asked Britain to deport Mallya, citing the revocation of his passport and a non-bailable warrant against him.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795809&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/vijay-mallya-kingfisher-villa-goa-banks-lenders-90-crore-2795809/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/10/vijay-mallya-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/10/vijay-mallya-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">vijay-mallya-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/mallya.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Kingfisher villa, Kingfisher villa goa, VIjay MAllya kingfisher villa, kingfisher villa vijay mallya,</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Delhi confidential: House Tactics</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/congress-rajya-sabha-viplove-thakur-olympics-delhi-confidential-house-tactics-2795801/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/congress-rajya-sabha-viplove-thakur-olympics-delhi-confidential-house-tactics-2795801/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:29:34 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:29:34 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795801</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Just before the House convened on Wednesday, party MP Viplove Thakur was heard telling fellow MPs: 'I met Supriya (NCP\u2019s Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule) and she told me that we have passed the Finance Bill, and if you do, too, both Houses will be adjourned sine die.'<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795801&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2331601\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/04/supriya-sule-l.jpg\" alt=\"delhi confidential, congress, rajya sabha, MP supriya sule, shiv sena, Maharashtra Krupal Tumane, Jagdish Prasad, Ministry of Health, UNICEF, WHO, indian government, Home Ministry, Rio de Janeiro Olympics, indian express news\" /> Supriya Sule\n<p>The <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> appears to enjoy using its majority to stall Rajya Sabha.

I told her, \u2018hum to nahi kar rahe (we are not doing it)\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Pay Hike</strong></p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Shiv Sena MP from Maharashtra Krupal Tumane demanded a pay hike for legislators, saying that his current monthly salary of Rs 50,000 doesn\u2019t even let him buy tea for people who visit his office. At this point, several MPs were seen stealing glances at the media gallery above to gauge the response. Seeing this, Tumane reproached his colleagues and told them to stop being so concerned about the media\u2019s reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Making An Input</strong></p>\n<p>In a government where even ministers refrain from making sweeping statements about how the government should function, Director General, Health Services, Jagdish Prasad left many flummoxed when he suggested that there should be a deputy prime minister to look into inter-ministerial coordination between social sector ministries. He was speaking on Tuesday at a national consultation on the need for transition from millennium development goals to sustainable development goals in the presence of senior officials of the Ministry of Health, UNICEF, WHO, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Line</strong></p>\n<p>Like many other countries across the globe, the Indian government has received a request for security personnel to be deployed during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics to be held in August this year. The posting, obviously, is a lucrative one as it comes with a free ticket to the greatest sports show on the planet.

The court added it was not necessary to declare drought for the entire state and that it should be so declared for districts or some villages too.</p>\n<p>Criticising the state governments in Bihar, Gujarat and Haryana for an \u201costrich-like attitude\u201d to drought-hit areas, the bench underlined that a delayed declaration of drought particularly affected women and children while also putting an undue strain on the resources of the states. It asked the agriculture secretary to convene a meeting within a week with the chief secretaries of Bihar, Gujarat and Haryana to review the drought situation.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795558&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/supreme-court-centre-drought-haryana-gujarat-bihar-2795558/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/drought-4801.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/drought-4801.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">drought  480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/drought-7591.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">drought, supreme court, supreme court drought, drought centre, SC Drought, centre drought , supreme court drought centre, centre drought supreme court, drought gujarat, drought haryana, bihar drought, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Politics at Kumbh: Amid controversy, Amit Shah takes holy dip with Dalit sadhus</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bjp-chief-amit-shah-dalit-sadhus-simhasth-kumbh-2795446/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bjp-chief-amit-shah-dalit-sadhus-simhasth-kumbh-2795446/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:15:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:42:27 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Liz Mathew]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795446</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Shah, initially scheduled to take the \u201cSamrasta Snan\u201d  along with sadhus from backward communities at Ram Ghat, the main ghat, had to change his plan at the last minute due to protests from a section of sants and Sangh leaders. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795446&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2795469 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/amit-shah1.jpg\" alt=\"Amit shah, Amit shah dalit sadhus, dalit sadhus amit shah, Simhasth Kumbh, Samrasta Snan, amit shah Samrasta Snan, \" /> <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> National President Amit Shah takes holy dip with dalit sadhus and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Kshipra river during Simhastha Mahakumbh in Ujjain on Wednesday. (Source: PTI)\n<p>In an attempt to reach out further to the Dalit community, in line with the strategy of the party and its ideological parent, BJP chief Amit Shah Wednesday took a holy dip with some Dalit sadhus in the Kshipra river at Valmiki Ghat in Ujjain.</p>\n<p>However, the confusion and apprehension among the sadhus, as well as a section of Sangh leaders, seemed to have overshadowed Shah\u2019s symbolic gesture.</p>\n<p>Shah, initially scheduled to take the \u201cSamrasta Snan\u201d (social harmony bath) along with sadhus from backward communities at Ram Ghat, the main ghat, had to change his plan at the last minute due to protests from a section of sants and Sangh leaders. According to them, such a move would have sent a wrong message \u2014 that Dalits had so far been restricted from taking a holy dip.

Addressing sadhus at a makeshift tent near Valmiki Ghat, Shah, accompanied by Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, said, \u201cThe BJP is the only party that believes in strengthening Indian culture and fosters the feeling of world as one family.\u201d Extending tributes to sants and sadhus on behalf of Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a>, he said with this, he has taken the holy dip in all four Kumbhs \u2014 Hardwar, Nasik, Allahabad and Ujjain.</p>\n<p>But Umeshnath of Valmiki Dham, who addressed sadhus and followers of Valmiki Akhara, did not hide his concern over divisions in the society. Pointing out that Lord Ram had embraced a lower caste person during his exile, Umeshnath urged them to \u201cdo away with caste lines and unite the nation\u201d. Appreciating Shah\u2019s \u201ccourage\u201d in taking a samrasta snan at Valmiki Ghat, he said: \u201cThe real courage will lie in reflecting this in mind, action and commitment&#8230;. Sants do not belong to any community. Let all sants resolve that they will work towards a caste-free society.\u201d</p>\n<p>Besides Chouhan, BJP general secretaries Kailash Vijaywargiya, Anil Jain, vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe also accompanied Shah in taking the dip. Along with them were Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad head Narendra Giri, Juna Akhara Peeth\u2019s head Awdheshanand, Valmiki Dham\u2019s Peethadheeshwar Umesh Nath, and several sadhus from Valmiki Akhara. Shah, along with Chouhan and his wife, later served food to sadhus at a programme \u2014 Samrasta Bhoj.</p>\n<p>Controversial saffron leader Sadhvi Prachi was also present at the function.</p>\n<p>Not all sadhus, though, were happy at the political tone given to the Kumbh Mela. While the venue on the Kshipra\u2019s banks had banners with pictures of Chouhan, advertising his government\u2019s initiatives and welcoming the devotees, a sant belonging to a backward community said: \u201cSamrasta snan may send a message but this politicisation is not good. Kumbh does not have any caste, and people do not look at caste of those who come here.

Richa recently joined the SP. However, on this issue of an off line entrance test, all the members of the union are united and jointly staged hunger strike on campus.</p>\n<p>The university was in the news for political reasons too last year when Richa had opposed the visit of BJP Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath who was invited by other union leaders.

Fearing unrest, the administration had canceled programme of Yogi on campus.</p>\n<p>In January this year, the ABVP members of the students\u2019 union had opposed Richa\u2019s invitation to former editor of The Hindu Siddharth Varadarajan as chief guest at a seminar. The ABVP argued that Varadarajan was a controversial man who wrote pro-Naxal and anti-national articles.

But the Article 276 (2) provides for capping and &#8220;with creative use of language&#8221; the government can accommodate.</p>\n<p>Referring to a media report that said some section in the government believes that GST is undesirable, the former Minister said, &#8220;the real opposition to GST is not coming from the Congress, it is coming from within the government.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He attacked the government for using Congress as &#8220;smoke screen&#8221; for the current situation of GST.</p>\n<p>Speaking about GDP growth figures, Ramesh said today nobody believes India&#8217;s GDP figures. &#8220;Chief Economic Advisor, RBI Governor, London economists and WallStreet Journal do not believe our GDP numbers,&#8221; he claimed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nobody is denying that we are having high growth rate. But the number put on GDP are highly suspicious. It (GDP growth) is somewhere between 5.9 per cent and 6.5 per cent and not 7.5 per cent,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Stating that India is growing and the country should grow much faster, Ramesh said, &#8220;For the first time, the credibility of GDP numbers are questioned. It has served the government purpose. I urge the government to pause a bit and come out with credible set of figures.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795394&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/congress-gst-bill-parliament-modi-government-kg-basin-jairam-ramesh-2795394/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jairam-ramesh2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jairam-ramesh2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">jairam ramesh2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/jairam-ramesh1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Congress GST, GST Congress, Congress GST Bill, GST bill rajya sabha, GST parliament</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Over 50 per cent drop in corruption complaints to CVC: Govt</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/over-50-per-cent-drop-in-corruption-complaints-to-cvc-govt-2795357/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/over-50-per-cent-drop-in-corruption-complaints-to-cvc-govt-2795357/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 18:16:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 18:16:05 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795357</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[In 2014, the Central Vigilance Commission received 62,363 complaints while in 2015 the complaints dropped to 29,838, the minister said in a written reply in Lok Sabha.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795357&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2587144\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/jitendra-singh759.jpg\" alt=\"Jitendra Singh\" /> Union Minister Jitendra Singh.

(Russian) MIG 29K fighter aircraft on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Onboard INS Hansa docked at Vasco &#8211; Admiral R K Dhowan, who witnessed the acrobatic maneuvers of the aircraft, commended its service and hailed its role in the maritime security. &#8220;Being one of the toughest known machines in air, we had some of the finest set of pilots flying them &#8211; the Sea Harriers,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>However, Dhowan suggested that given the new threats and challenges in air, the multi role supersonic MiG 29K gave the Indian Navy an upper hand in aerial defence.</p>\n<p>Holding that the Navy held safety of both its manpower and machines at prime importance, Dhowan said Navy was taking corrective recourse such as detailed analysis of air accidents in the past, ensuring that its personnel strictly adhered to the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to avoid untoward incidents.</p>\n<p>In its immediate future, Dhowan said that the Navy was looking at induction of Naval Utility Helicopters and Medium Range Maritime Reconnaissance aircrafts.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

With increasing access to information technology and changing nature of our globalised economy; new threats for children are emerging &#8211; sex tourism, child pornography, online threats to children among others,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The Home Minister said at the same time, large number of children are adversely affected due to rapid climate change, disasters and conflict.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are increasingly realizing that we cannot commit ourselves to protecting children without providing an overarching social protection network to them and their families. The biggest challenge is to identify and track children and their families who are vulnerable and reach out to them,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Singh said in India, the government is trying to ensure a protective environment for children by bringing all citizens, including children under the purview of social security by linking them with AADHAAR \u2013 Unique Identification number which will empower them to access to their entitlements directly without any hindrance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have set up a National Portal \u2013the Track Child which not only has data on &#8216;missing&#8217; children but it also has live database to monitor the progress of the &#8216;found&#8217; children who are availing various services in different Child Care Institutions,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The Home Minister said in recent past, a large number of children were rescued and restore them to their families or provide a protected environment to them through a special initiative called Operation Smile &#8211; a drive pioneered jointly by Police, Ministry of Women and Child Development, District administration, civil society organisations and community.</p>\n<p>Singh said safety, security, dignity and wellbeing of our children and young people will determine the wellbeing and strength of our countries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;SAIEVAC is a coalition of States which aims at protection of the rights of children, particularly protection of children from all forms of discrimination, abuse, neglect, exploitation, torture, trafficking; that is any kind of violence.

In contrast, cities like Guwahati and Bhubaneswar have figured in the list of 100 smart cities.</p>\n<p>Naidu also made a veiled attack on the Trinamool regime in West Bengal, blaming it for lack of proper governance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Only fund is not the criteria for smart city programmes. Governance is also important and I think you understand what I mean,&#8221; Naidu told Trinamool members.</p>\n<p>The minister said the project was aimed at creating 100 smart cities to work as &#8220;light houses&#8221; for others to follow.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795166&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/western-india-lacks-brains-says-bjp-mp-bhola-singh-2795166/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bhola-singh-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bhola-singh-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Bhola-singh-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/435232d9d6e68bceac465179e73e0dbf?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kris1290</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/bhola-singh-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">File photo of BJP MP Bhola Singh.

(Source: PTI/File)\n<p>Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray, who is presently embroiled in a bitter battle of oneupmanship with the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>, was admitted to the Lilavati Hospital on Monday morning.</p>\n<p>Party sources claimed that Thackeray was admitted for a routine checkup.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He is admitted in Lilavati Hospital for his routine checkup. His health is fine no question of worries. He will be discharged by today late afternoon,&#8221; Maharashtra Health Minister and senior Shiv Sena leader Dr Deepak Sawant said.</p>\n<p>The Sena chief has been involved in a bitter game of oneupmanship with the BJP for the past 18 months. The BJP had earlier this week decided to launch a direct assault on Thackeray himself when BJP MP Kirit Somaiyya claimed that the BMC was being run by a &#8220;saheb&#8221; from Bandra along with two of his cronies.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you ask anybody why corruption goes on, the reply is they have blessings of those in power and their personal assistants,\u201d he said, though he did not name the Sena President Uddhav Thackeray or his personal assistant.</p>\n<p>The Sena has been stunned by this direct assault on Thackeray himself and is likely to have added to the Sena chief&#8217;s woes. Thackeray has also over the past few days been making rounds of drought-hit Marahtwada where temperatures are searing.</p>\n<p>A teetotaler and an avid badminton player, Thackeray has faced health issues. In 2012, he had been diagnosed with multiple blockages in his heart and had undergone angioplasty twice where eight stents were inserted into his constricted arteries.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794910&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/shiv-sena-chief-admitted-to-lilavati-hosp-for-routine-checkup/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/10/uddhav-4801.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/10/uddhav-4801.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">uddhav-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/17785f3ebe9c18421c5f0c2fe81c6aec?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">abhimanyuchakra</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/uddhav5.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Shiv Sena, Uddhav thackeray, Uddhav Thackeray health, Uddhav health problem</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Rahul Gandhi on Uttarakhand win: &#8216;Hope Modiji learns his lesson&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/rahul-gandhi-uttarakhand-congress-government-narendra-modi-bjp-2794841/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/rahul-gandhi-uttarakhand-congress-government-narendra-modi-bjp-2794841/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 13:27:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 13:41:35 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794841</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Rahul Gandhi said that the people of India will not tolerate 'the murder of democracy'.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794841&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2789269\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/rahul-759.jpg\" alt=\"Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.

Singh Badal at the Indian Express idea exchange in New Delhi. Express photo by RAVI KANOJIA. New Delhi Feb 15th-2011\" /> Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal (File/Express)\n<p>Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal\u2019s China visit has come in for criticism from industrialists across sectors. While dairy farmers urged China to take lessons from them, bicycle industrialists said they are \u2018competent enough.\u2019 Polyhouse farmers, however, are clueless about plans of Sukhbir regarding growing \u2018Chinese\u2019 vegetables. Overall, Sukhbir\u2019s China visit may have buoyed big industrial houses but failed to enthuse small and medium industrialists and even the progressive farmers.</p>\n<p>Daljeet Singh Sadarpura, president of progressive dairy farmers association, Punjab said, \u201cI read in newspapers that Sukhbir visited some dairy farmers plants in China in the name of \u2018technology exchange.\u2019 However, he is not aware that China entered dairy farming in a serious way about five-seven years ago only, earlier they were importing milk products as Chinese lifestyle does involve much use of milk products. In fact, Punjab\u2019s dairy farming meets world-class standards and today our cows produce 9,000 litres milk in 305 days compared to American cows which produce 10,000 litres in the same duration. So we are close to them. And hence we are capable of giving lessons to Chinese, rather than learning from them.\u201d</p>\n<p>G S Kang, another progressive dairy farmer based in Phidde village of Ferozepur, added, \u201cWhile wrong policies of the Punjab government have diminished the prospects of Punjab\u2019s dairy industry and instead of improving it, the Deputy CM is keen in copying China\u2019s dairy farming who are still taking baby steps in this direction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sukhbir also took a keen interest in the agricultural practices of China and had given a press statement that China would assist Punjab farmers in growing vegetables that will be useful in Chinese food products. \u201c We are not aware of this plan and once it is unfolded we will be able to comment upon it. As of now, we think that it is much ado about nothing. Such castles in air are expected in the election year.\u201d</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794635&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/chinese-should-learn-from-us-sukhbir-singh-badal-2794635/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/10/sukhbir-thumb.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/10/sukhbir-thumb.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">sukhbir-thumb</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/sukhbir-singh-badal759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal at the Indian Express idea exchange in New Delhi.

We have our own Whatsapp group, where we post things that are funny, and are always in touch. For us (the photography department of <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a>), our lives and lifestyle have been closely knit all these years. All our night-outs, parties and work have been with each other. Ravi had recently got a new place in Delhi\u2019s Rajnagar Extension, and he was planning a party as well.</p>\n<p>One thing that I admired the most about him was that he was a complete disciplinarian. I used to tell this to other people, too. It is not just about waking up early. It was everything \u2014 from what to buy, to clothes to cleanliness to investments.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2794510 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/nizamuddin-baoli-759.jpg\" alt=\"Ravi Kanojia, Ravi Kanojia death, Ravi Kanojia photos, Express Photographer, Express Photographer death, Ravi Kanojia Indian Express, Indian Express\" /> A boy jumps into a baoli at Nizamuddin Dargah in Delhi \u2014 winner of Delhi Tourism award during the Commonwealth Games.\n<p>He was very particular about the way he looked and smelled. He was very particular about technology and gadgets too. The Indian Express social networking presence is among the strongest, and he was the main Instagrammer.</p>\n<p>Coming from Ludhiana, he had an innate sense of pride in everything he had achieved. Whatever he did, he valued so much. And it wasn\u2019t just the awards, but also the smallest things in his life. For instance, if there was a message from the editors praising a photograph \u2014 he would wear it like a star on his shoulders.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2794509 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/rk-sachin-759.jpg\" alt=\"Ravi Kanojia, Ravi Kanojia death, Ravi Kanojia photos, Express Photographer, Express Photographer death, Ravi Kanojia Indian Express, Indian Express\" /> Sachin Tendulkar at a BCCI photoshoot a day before his last Ranji trophy match in 2013.\n<p>We used to play pranks on him a lot. I remember when he first got transferred from Ludhiana to Delhi. It was in 2009. We were supposed to go and shoot the Ramnath Goenka Awards. Ravi didn\u2019t know his way around Delhi at that time. Another photographer from our team, Praveen Khanna, and I were always mischievous with him in the beginning.</p>\n<p>That evening, Ravi was on his motorcycle, as were we, and he kept telling us, \u201cDon\u2019t drive too fast. I don\u2019t want to get lost.\u201d Khanna and I have this thing where we don\u2019t talk but make eye contact. We did so that moment, too, and at a roundabout close by, we starting driving round and round until we spread out and vanished. Ravi kept going around and got lost.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2794505 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/indiagate-yoga-759.jpg\" alt=\"Ravi Kanojia, Ravi Kanojia death, Ravi Kanojia photos, Express Photographer, Express Photographer death, Ravi Kanojia Indian Express, Indian Express\" /> Rehearsal for International Yoga Day in 2015\n<p>The most beautiful thing about him was that he used to show distress but was always smiling. No matter how much one was rude to him, and even I have been many times, he was always smiling. He was never angry or impatient. He was very calm and mature about everything.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2794506 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jln-yoga-759.jpg\" alt=\"Ravi Kanojia, Ravi Kanojia death, Ravi Kanojia photos, Express Photographer, Express Photographer death, Ravi Kanojia Indian Express, Indian Express\" /> Another shot of International Yoga Day rehearsal, at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.\n<p>Another thing he used to keep saying was, \u201cAapne bataya nahi\u201d (You didn\u2019t tell). One day he kept saying that and I lost my cool. He quietly smiled and said, \u201cAapne bataya toh tha, par samjhaya nahi\u201d. (You did tell, but didn\u2019t explain).</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2794655\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/muzaffarnagar-riots-759.jpg\" alt=\" An image from Ravi Kanojia\u2019s series on the Muzaffarnagar riots, which won him a National Award in 2014.\" /> An image from Ravi Kanojia\u2019s series on the Muzaffarnagar riots, which won him a National Award in 2014.\n<p>He won a National Award in 2014 for his photographs of the Muzaffarnagar riots (top). In 2010, he won the Best Photographer in the north Indian region by the Canon Press. During the Commonwealth Games, there was a photography campaign by Delhi Tourism, and his photographs did really well there as well.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2794508 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/rk-f1-grnoida-759.jpg\" alt=\"Ravi Kanojia, Ravi Kanojia death, Ravi Kanojia photos, Express Photographer, Express Photographer death, Ravi Kanojia Indian Express, Indian Express\" /> Sebastian Vettel of Germany after winning the Indian Formula One Grand Prix at the Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida.\n<p>He was extremely particular about his photographs but, beyond that, he made sure he updated himself on photography, both from India and other countries.

are found only in Gujarat. When Gujarat is considered as one of the favourite dens of the saffron party, the failure of the BJP government both in the state and at the Centre in saving the lives of Asiatic lions casts doubts on the sincerity of the government in its wildlife conservation efforts,\u201d Gogoi said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the last five years over 300 lion deaths were reported in Gujarat, which makes a mockery of the conservation efforts of the Centre and the state government in Gujarat,\u201d Gogoi said. Citing official statistics, the Assam chief minister said that while 76 lion deaths were reported in 2013 in Gujarat, the figure had jumped to 78 in 2014, and to 91 in 2015.</p>\n<p>Union forest and environment minister Javadekar had on Monday informed Rajya Sabha that while the rhino population in Assam had gone up from 2,505 in 2012 to 2,624 in 2015, in West Bengal it rose from 229 in 2013 to 225 in 2015. Uttar Pradesh on the other hand ha recorded 34 rhinos in 2015, he said.</p>\n<p>This increase, Javadekar had said, was mainly due to a series of initiatives taken by the Centre, the most important being creation of Protected Areas all over the country under the provisions of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 to conserve wild animals and their habitats. Most of the rhino habitats are part of Tiger Reserves at Kaziranga Tiger Reserve, Manas Tiger Reserve, Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and Jaldapara Tiger Reserve, Javadekar had said.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794428&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/tarun-gogoi-snubs-centre-for-claiming-credit-for-rhino-population-asks-why-are-lions-dying-2794428/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/tarun-gogoi-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/tarun-gogoi-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">tarun-gogoi-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/tarun-gogoi-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\"> Tarun Gogoi, prakash javadekar, union forest and environment minister, assam rhinos, rhinos in assam, increase in rhino population, lion population in gujarat, gujarat lion, save tiger, save asiatic lions, asiatic lions, gir forest, indian express news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Nabarangpur: Poorest district leaps to top 5 in Odisha with 92 per cent pass in Class X</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/odisha-nabarangpur-poorest-district-leaps-to-top-5-in-odisha-with-92-per-cent-pass-in-class-x-2794420/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/odisha-nabarangpur-poorest-district-leaps-to-top-5-in-odisha-with-92-per-cent-pass-in-class-x-2794420/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 05:44:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 05:44:52 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Uma Vishnu]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794420</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Class X results declared on May 2, standing fifth among the state\u2019s 30 districts.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794420&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/topic/district-zero/\">NABARANGPUR</a> has scored an A-plus.

According to 2015-16 data provided by the District Education Office, Nabarangpur\u2019s elementary schools are short by 985 teachers and secondary schools by 290 teachers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHistory has been created in Nabarangpur,\u201d said District Education Officer Kulamani Nathsharma. \u201cIf you count the correspondence students and the ex-regular students (those who failed or couldn\u2019t sit for the exam last year), Nabarangpur has a pass percentage of 90.73 per cent and we stand first in the state. Of the 12,281 students who sat for the Class 10 exams, close to 30 per cent have secured first division. Last year, 93 students scored above 80 per cent; this year, 153 students have scored that much. And we have five students who scored above 90 per cent, up from one last year,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Nathsharma attributed these \u201cspectacular results\u201d to \u201cpersistent monitoring, inspection and tracking of teachers\u2019 attendance\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single child who hasn\u2019t been enrolled in school. In January-February, before the exams, we hold remedial classes for children who need help \u2014 an hour each in the morning and evening. This year, we upgraded 14 upper primary schools to high schools and four of our 10 CBSE model schools will take in students this academic year,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>However, there is still some catching up to do. \u201cThis is a poor district and there are some very remote villages that are cut off from the block or district headquarters. The teachers who get posted to these places report for duty, leave and don\u2019t return. There must be some way of keeping teachers back or maybe getting local teachers,\u201d said the principal of a school in Jharigam block who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>According to the District Information System for Education (DISE) data for 2014-15, Nabarangpur also has a high dropout rate of 24.23 per cent for Class 8, compared to 4.88 per cent for Odisha and 6.88 nationally.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe tracking system under Right To Education (RTE) is very strong but that\u2019s only until they clear Class 8. After that, girls either drop out to get married or because the high schools are far away from their homes,\u201d said Radhanath Behera, a retired principal of Nabarangpur College, one of the only two degree colleges, both private, in the district headquarters.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794420&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/odisha-nabarangpur-poorest-district-leaps-to-top-5-in-odisha-with-92-per-cent-pass-in-class-x-2794420/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/school-children-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/school-children-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">school-children-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Under cloud for long, Pondicherry University vice-chancellor Chandra Krishnamurthy resigns</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/under-cloud-for-long-pondicherry-university-vice-chancellor-chandra-krishnamurthy-resigns-2794418/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/under-cloud-for-long-pondicherry-university-vice-chancellor-chandra-krishnamurthy-resigns-2794418/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 05:38:23 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 05:38:23 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ritika Chopra]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794418</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Indian Express had reported on November 22, 2014 that Krishnamurthy plagiarised most of one book mentioned in her CV, which also listed two other books that may have never been published at all.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794418&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2794421 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/chandra-krishnamurthy.jpg\" alt=\"pondicherry, pondicherry VC, Pondicherry University, Chandra Krishnamurthy, HRD ministry, smriti irani, UGC, pondicherry VN resigns, indian express news, pondicherry university news\" /> Pondicherry University vice-chancellor Chandra Krishnamurthy.

The government is yet to take a call on whether it should accept the resignation. \u201cWe have received it and the resignation is currently being examined by us,\u201d said a senior ministry official, who did not wish to be identified.</p>\n<p>Krishnamurthy, who is currently on forced leave, was appointed as the university\u2019s first woman head by the UPA government in February 2013 and has a little less than two years left in her tenure. The Indian Express could not reach her for a comment.</p>\n<p>The government, sources said, is in two minds about accepting her resignation, especially after the precedent set by the sacking of Visva-Bharati V-C Sushanta Dattagupta. Dattagupta, who was accused of financial and administrative irregularities, had also quit in anticipation of his removal, but the ministry did not accept it and sacked him in February this year. His removal was the first sacking of a central university head in the country\u2019s history.</p>\n<p>Krishnamurthy\u2019s future has been uncertain since early last year after the UGC instituted an inquiry following an indefinite agitation by a section of students and teachers that left the institutions paralysed. The students and faculty were seeking her ouster for alleged autocratic behaviour and mismanagement of university affairs.</p>\n<p>On October 23, 2015, The Indian Express reported that the probe \u2014 led by former V-C of Punjab University Jai Rup Singh, former bureaucrat Nita Chowdhury and ex-director of Indian Law Institute K N Chandrasekharan Pillai \u2014 had found that Krishnamurthy authored only one book against the claim of three in her CV. It also found that she lied about guiding nine PhD students and receiving four research projects. The V-C claimed to have written 25 articles in her CV, but the probe could trace only one, which was also plagiarised.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794418&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/under-cloud-for-long-pondicherry-university-vice-chancellor-chandra-krishnamurthy-resigns-2794418/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/chandra-krishnamurthy-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/chandra-krishnamurthy-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Chandra-Krishnamurthy-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/chandra-krishnamurthy.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">pondicherry, pondicherry VC, Pondicherry University, Chandra Krishnamurthy, HRD ministry, smriti irani, UGC, pondicherry VN resigns, indian express news, pondicherry university news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>To delink caste from quota for \u2018poor\u2019, BJP steps over faultlines</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-bjp-rupani-to-delink-caste-from-quota-for-poor-bjp-steps-over-faultlines-2794406/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-bjp-rupani-to-delink-caste-from-quota-for-poor-bjp-steps-over-faultlines-2794406/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 05:24:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 05:24:22 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Sheela Bhatt]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794406</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Gujarat government is committed to honestly implement 10 per cent reservation for non-reserved poor people. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794406&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2794415\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/rupani.jpg\" alt=\"gujarat, BJP, gujarat BJP, muslims in gujarat, gujarat muslims, muslim quota, minority quota, gujarat government, gujarat bjp chief, vijay rupani, indian express news\" /> Vijay Rupani, Gujarat <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> chief.\n<p>BRUSHING aside legal objections and what critics describe as fears of \u201csocial tension\u201d, the BJP government in Gujarat is pushing to implement its new 10 per cent reservation for the poor during college admissions starting this month.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Gujarat government is committed to honestly implement 10 per cent reservation for non-reserved poor people. We have issued the notification and have instructed all educational institutions to start admitting students as soon as the results of classes X and XII are declared.

There is tension all over Gujarat among all castes about this. The Patels and other upper castes feel that this political decision will be stayed in the very first hearing by a court. All of us will be back to square one,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are not against the poor from upper castes. Like us, we know that they suffer. We want to tell the BJP, \u2018don\u2019t play politics\u2019. Also, look after our poor as well,\u201d said Thakor.</p>\n<p>Anand Yagnik, Ahmedabad-based lawyer, described the decision as a \u201ccomplete violation\u201d of the 1992 Supreme Court judgment that identified caste as the criteria for reservation. \u201cIt\u2019s a sham. Any level of camouflage won\u2019t help inside the courtroom,\u201d said Yagnik.</p>\n<p>The new quota has also elicited a mixed response from Patidars who want to continue with their demand for inclusion on the OBC list.</p>\n<p>The Opposition <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>, too, appears to be playing it safe, with its former state chief Arjun Modhawadia virtually endorsing the move.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter the Patidar agitation, we had announced that in line with the Congress\u2019s national manifestos of 2009 and 2014, we want 10-20 per cent reservation in Gujarat for the economically backward classes, in accordance with their population,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Speaking to The Indian Express, BJP state chief Vijay Rupani defended the government move, saying it was in tune with \u201cthe demand of the times\u201d. He said that the decision was also in line with various schemes of the central and state governments that cater to the poor.</p>\n<p>Asked how the state would justify the quota if it was legally challenged, Rupani said, \u201cWe will justify it on the grounds that bright and clever children from poor families often do not get admissions in institutes of higher education. The Right to Education (RTE), introduced by the Congress, had a provision for poor children in schools. On similar grounds, we will argue that poor children who are craving for higher education need attention and a system that assures admission under RTE.\u201d</p>\n<p>Responding to allegations levelled by critics, such as Thakor, that the idea may not be Constitutionally viable, Rupani said, \u201cThere is no issue of the Constitution involved here. The way weaker sections get plots to build cheap houses, the way government projects are planned and implemented for them, we have carved out a quota&#8230;\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794406&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-bjp-rupani-to-delink-caste-from-quota-for-poor-bjp-steps-over-faultlines-2794406/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/rupani-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/rupani-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">rupani-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/rupani.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">gujarat, BJP, gujarat BJP, muslims in gujarat, gujarat muslims, muslim quota, minority quota, gujarat government, gujarat bjp chief, vijay rupani, indian express news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Officer versus officer over Teesta Setalvad&#8217;s trust file, CBI case</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/officer-versus-officer-over-teesta-setalvad-trust-file-cbi-case-2794399/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/officer-versus-officer-over-teesta-setalvad-trust-file-cbi-case-2794399/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 05:17:19 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 05:58:05 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794399</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Summoned by the CBI Wednesday, Joshi Tuesday accused his seniors of targeting him because he \u201crefused to go soft\u201d on donor agency Ford Foundation.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794399&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2369964\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/teesta-main.jpg\" alt=\" Teesta Setalvad, Teesta Setalvad trust file, CBI, CBI inquiry, joshi, corruption, corruption case, anand joshi, FCRA, sabrang trust, indian express news, india news, teesta news, latest news\" /> Social activist Teesta Setalvad\n<p>A corruption case registered Monday by the CBI against Home Ministry Under Secretary Anand Joshi, who was also accused of being in illegal possession of a file relating to actions under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) against activist Teesta Setalvad\u2019s NGO Sabrang Trust, has triggered a spat within the Ministry.</p>\n<p>Summoned by the CBI Wednesday, Joshi Tuesday accused his seniors of targeting him because he \u201crefused to go soft\u201d on donor agency Ford Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>Read |\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/home-ministry-official-anand-joshi-booked-on-graft-charges-2792436/\">Home Ministry official, Anand Joshi, booked on graft charges</a></strong></p>\n<p>\u201cI was offered around Rs 200-250 crore to remove Ford Foundation from a blacklist.

Mr Joshi was not part of the 4-member Inspection Team which had visited the Trust\u2019s office in Mumbai for inspection,\u201d it stated.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe further state that other than one official communication from the FCRA department signed by Shri Anand Joshi, Under Secretary, and the Trust\u2019s response to it&#8230; at no point was there any other communication of any kind from him to the Trust/its Trustees,\u201d it stated.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794399&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/officer-versus-officer-over-teesta-setalvad-trust-file-cbi-case-2794399/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/teesta.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/teesta.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Teesta</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/teesta-main.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\"> Teesta Setalvad, Teesta Setalvad trust file, CBI, CBI inquiry, joshi, corruption, corruption case, anand joshi, FCRA, sabrang trust, indian express news, india news, teesta news, latest news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Look who\u2019s Amma\u2019s ambassador in God\u2019s own country</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-election-j-jayalalithaa-aiadmk-2794405/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-election-j-jayalalithaa-aiadmk-2794405/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 05:15:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 08:26:57 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Amrith Lal]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794405</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Liquor baron, whose bribery charge toppled Kerala\u2019s finance minister, has unleashed a \u2018Tamil-style\u2019 poll campaign in the state capital.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794405&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2794410\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jaya-kerala.jpg\" alt=\"kerala election, MGR films, J Jayalalithaa, Jayalalithaa kerala election, AIADMK, kerala news, kerala, kerala news, viral video, kerala polls, India news\" /> Flexboards sporting Jayalalithaa, MGR, Biju Ramesh.

With a jeep and a cart in front, the procession winds its way past the narrow lanes of Puthenthoppu, a fishing hamlet in Thiruvananthapuram, and stops where the road opens to the Arabian Sea.

After all, it was his bribery allegation that forced the powerful state finance minister K M Mani to resign \u2014 ironically, the AIADMK\u2019s two-leaves symbol has been allotted to Mani\u2019s Kerala <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> (M) this time.</p>\n<p><b><div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-election-j-jayalalithaa-aiadmk-2794405/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/from-films-to-life-tns-cult-of-the-mother/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/m-g-ramachandran-s.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">From films to life, Tamil Nadu\u2019s cult of the mother</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/profile-jayalalithaa-the-amma-of-indian-politics/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/05/jayalalithaa209.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Profile: She wanted to study...a film role changed her life</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/to-beat-poll-code-first-jaya-movie-with-mgr-returns-angers-dmk/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jayamgrt.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">To beat poll code, first Jaya movie with MGR returns, angers DMK</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/reading-ammas-mind/\"><span class=\"text\">Reading Amma\u0092s mind</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/latest-news/jayalalithaa-the-iron-lady-who-proved-her-mettle-again/\"><span class=\"text\">Jayalalithaa: The &#039;iron lady&#039; who proved her mettle again</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/jaya-boycott-dmdk-upbeat-for-bypolls/\"><span class=\"text\">Jaya boycott: DMDK upbeat for bypolls</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</b></p>\n<p>In a way, Ramesh has framed the election agenda in Kerala, which votes on May 16. In December 2014, he alleged on primetime TV that the bar owners\u2019 association in the state \u2014 he was the working president \u2014 had paid a bribe of Rs 1 crore to Mani to facilitate licences. The fallout led to Mani\u2019s resignation and forced Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to announce phased prohibition.</p>\n<p>Chandy\u2019s policy caught many in his own party and the Opposition unawares, but got the backing of the influential Latin Catholic church and the ruling ally Muslim League. With the prohibition agenda becoming an election issue, the CPI(M)-led Opposition was forced to uncork its own liquor policy leaning more towards temperance.</p>\n<p>With a string of bars in the capital, Ramesh, 51, is not happy with the new policy but defends Amma\u2019s support for phased prohibition. But then, Ramesh is more than just about bars. His website describes him as entrepreneur and philanthropist and one holding a doctorate in business administration. His Rajadhani Group has at least 14 hotels in and around Thiruvananthapuram, has invested in realty and offers trade and technology solutions.</p>\n<p>At his sprawling office near the Kerala capital\u2019s iconic Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple, he clarifies that he is not a politician and had refused offers from Left parties and the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>. \u201cBut when Amma asked me I could not refuse,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The AIADMK doesn\u2019t boast of much presence in Thiruvananthapuram, although the constituency of over 1.8 lakh is home to around 35,000 Tamil-speaking voters. So, how did Ramesh come under the radar of Amma? He says he took an AIADMK membership six years ago and since has become friends with many AIADMK ministers.</p>\n<p>\u0081\u201dI am not concerned about the outcome. I am contesting because of my love and respect for Amma,\u201d he said. Such devotion is what has made the political careers many AIADMK cadres MLAs, MPs and ministers in Tamil Nadu, which is just an hour\u2019s drive from Thiruvananthapuram. In fact, Ramesh claims he was one of five \u2014 the four others were AIADMK ministers \u2014 who were allowed to receive Amma when she launched the party\u2019s campaign in Coimbatore.</p>\n<p>Ramesh admits he has business interests, including property, in Tamil Nadu. He claims he joined the AIADMK, which was then the main Opposition, after a minister demanded a bribe to let him construct a hotel in Kanyakumari. He refused to pay, he said, and the hotel has still not been completed. Now, having entered the contest, he is keen to make the most of it.</p>\n<p>Every morning, he sets out on the campaign trail with a bunch of followers \u2014 one of them admitted he was on hire \u2014 to canvas in the name of Amma. His glossy pamphlet outlines his 46-point development agenda. All households have been promised freebies ranging from TVs, refrigerators, fans, mixer-grinders, sewing machines and other household goods. Brides have been promised Rs 25,000 and four grams of gold; the cash component has been doubled for girls with a degree. Housing projects, subsidies for Haj as well as pilgrimages to Jerusalem and Hindu centres, CCTVs at bus stations, toilet facilities at bus stations, diesel subsidy for fishermen are part of his promises.</p>\n<p>So who will fund these freebies and schemes? \u201cAmma,\u201d said Ramesh, adding, \u201cIt will be a new thing in India\u2019s federal set-up where the chief minister of a neighbouring state will fund schemes in another state.\u201d</p>\n<p>There will be pressure from residents of 139 other assembly constituencies in Kerala on political parties to rethink their welfare agenda, he said. Amma has also promised to set up a state-of-the-art garbage disposal plant on land to be provided by the candidate, said Ramesh.</p>\n<p>However, having been a Thiruvananthapuram resident all his life, Ramesh knows what the constituency needs. On top of his agenda is making the city garbage-free. He agenda lists better sewage and drainage facilities, more toilets at public places and so on. He also speaks in detail about the lack of facilities at the numerous resettlement colonies.</p>\n<p>The Thiruvananthapuram constituency includes the Secretariat area, in the heart of the city, and the coast adjoining the airport. The Congress has fielded minister V S Sivakumar and the Left candidate is Antony Raju, a Janadhipathya Kerala Congress leader. Former cricketer Sreesanth is the BJP nominee.</p>\n<p>Ramesh singles out Sivakumar for criticism and claims the Congress has been targeting him since he came up with the bar bribery allegation. He claims that he blurted out details about the payment when he got irritated by the sanctimonious talk of fellow panellists on a TV show. \u201cWhen the journalists named the minister, I refused to retract my statement,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794405&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-election-j-jayalalithaa-aiadmk-2794405/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jaya-kerala-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jaya-kerala-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">jaya-kerala-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b79f669bb80e3de68460b2235b5e7285?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">maneeshkarki</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/jaya-kerala.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kerala election, MGR films, J Jayalalithaa, Jayalalithaa kerala election, AIADMK, kerala news, kerala, kerala news, viral video, kerala polls, India news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Connecting with Lakshadweep &#038; the Andamans: Charting a digital course to the fringes</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/connecting-with-lakshadweep-the-andamans-charting-a-digital-course-to-the-fringes/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/connecting-with-lakshadweep-the-andamans-charting-a-digital-course-to-the-fringes/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 04:54:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 04:54:40 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Pranav Mukul]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794394</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Telecom Commission has approved laying down of submarine optic fibre cable between Chennai and the Andamans.

The augmentation of the satellites will juice up the bandwidth capacity almost three times to 318 megabits per second (Mbps) from the existing 102 Mbps. This project will also be funded by the USOF, but the annual transponder charges will be funded by the Union territory\u2019s administration, The Indian Express learnt.</p>\n<p>The DoT, in January 2014, had written to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) seeking the latter\u2019s suggestions on improving telecom connectivity in the two Union territories. \u201cLack of high bandwidth communication channels pose a serious challenge in rolling out e-governance solutions apart from the many constraints in communication during both normal operations as well as during any potential emergency,\u201d the DoT had told Trai.</p>\n<p>The Trai, too, recognising the strategic importance of the two island clusters, had submitted its recommendations in July 2014, which were cleared by the DoT\u2019s apex decision making body.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe geographical configuration and the location of the ANI (Andaman and Nicobar Islands) chain in the Bay of Bengal and Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea safeguards India\u2019s eastern and western seaboards, respectively. Provision of secure, reliable, robust, and affordable telecom facilities in these islands is of utmost importance for the people living in these islands and from a strategic point of view to the whole country,\u201d Trai had said.</p>\n<p>Recently, Trai had asked the telecom ministry to roll out comprehensive communications network at Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep even if the cost was higher than estimated, with the islands assuming \u201cimmense strategic importance\u201d. The telecom and media regulator had originally recommended an initial plan costing about Rs 2,400 crore to connect the two Union territories which at present are only dependent on satellites for connectivity.</p>\n<p>The Trai had said that in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 29 out of 576 islands are inhabited and 90 per cent of the population lives in three islands \u2014 North, Middle and South Andaman Islands alone. In Lakshadweep, 11 out of 36 are inhabited and 10 of the inhabited islands have population above 100.</p>\n<p>For Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, the regulator suggested connecting the 22 islands, which included 18 islands with population of above 100 and four islands which have presence of police, forest camps and tourists.</p>\n<p>The government had also appointed Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd to prepare a detailed project report on improving connectivity to these islands.</p>\n<p>The Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands are a part of the West Bengal telecom circle and Lakshadweep is a part of the Kerala circle. In Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, four telecom operators \u2014 BSNL, Bharti Airtel,</p>\n<p>Vodafone India and Reliance Communications \u2014 have launched services, while in Lakshadweep only BSNL and Bharti Airtel have their services.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven the telecom service providers, who have rolled out their network in these islands, are concentrated only around the capital, district headquarter or bigger islands. Even BSNL is not keen to expand its network to all the inhabited islands and villages because these operations are commercially unviable,\u201d Trai had said in its recommendations issued in July 2014.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794394&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/connecting-with-lakshadweep-the-andamans-charting-a-digital-course-to-the-fringes/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/ravi-shankar-prasad-4801.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/ravi-shankar-prasad-4801.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">ravi-shankar-prasad-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b79f669bb80e3de68460b2235b5e7285?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">maneeshkarki</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/ravi-shankar-prasad759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Ravi Shankar Prasad, Telecom Commission, submarine optic fibre cable, optic fibre cable, Chennai Andamans optic fibre, Lakshadweep optic fibre cable, Lakshadweep, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Andaman and Nicobar, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Hyderabad: 5 of family killed over property</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hyderabad-5-of-family-killed-over-property-2794398/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hyderabad-5-of-family-killed-over-property-2794398/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 04:51:11 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 04:51:11 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794398</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Officials said the assailants were nephews of the family head Naimatullah Khan, a former Bhainsa town municipal corporator.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794398&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five members of a family, including three women, were murdered allegedly by close relatives over a property dispute in Bhainsa town of Adilabad district on Tuesday.

Earlier, nine MLAs had left them, today one more was added to that tally, \u201c said BJP MLA Ganesh Joshi.</p>\n<p>Madan Singh Bisht, the Congress MLA who was shown in a purported sting just two days before the floor test, claiming that he had got 12 Congress MLAs money to support Rawat, said, \u201cWe were always together. As for the sting, let me watch all of it and then I will take legal action.\u201d</p>\n<p>Addressing Congress workers in the afternoon, Rawat said Wednesday will bring a new beginning and urged the Centre to support Uttarakhand\u2019s development. \u201cI want to thank all my supporters, the Supreme Court and most of all the people of Uttarakhand. Pichle do mahenein ek bhayanak sapne ki tarah the (The last two months were like a nightmare). But I want to forget all this and move forward. I want to tell the Centre, if you can give us a helping hand, please do that. You are mighty people, we are just a small state,\u201d said Rawat to the jubilant crowd that had collected at the Congress Bhavan in the heart of the city.</p>\n<p>The official result may be a day away but the speculation that Rawat will call for early elections is growing louder. \u201cIt can be discussed later but we are in no hurry. Already, we have lost a lot of time and we now want to focus on development,\u201d said senior Congress leader Hira Singh Bisht.</p>\n<p>The party is expected to discuss the issue in the meetings they will hold after the results of the floor test are announced. \u201cThis will come up for discussion. We have a thin majority now. Nine MLAs had been disqualified bringing the strength of the house down to 61. It is difficult to predict but we are ready to go to the people. The environment is good for us, people are angry with the BJP. We are in any case prepared for elections next year, the organisation is ready, our senior leaders are ready. We have already lost two months in such a crucial time, there is a lot of development work to be done,\u201d said senior vice president of the Uttarakhand Congress Suryakant Dhasmana.</p>\n<p>BJP spokesperson Munna Singh Chauhan said Rawat shouldn\u2019t expect smooth sailing ahead. \u201cWe are where we were on the March 18. In fact, we have marginally gained because the Congress is poorer by one MLA. They have lost their tenth MLA and if they think it\u2019s a small loss, then God help them. The episode has weakened Rawatji\u2019s position and he doesn\u2019t have the confidence of his MLAs nor of his leadership,\u201d said Chauhan.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794065&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttarakhand-floor-test-congress-claims-majority-bjp-doesnt-disagree-harish-rawat-president-rule-2794065/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/harish-rawat2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/harish-rawat2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Uttarakhand Assembly floor test</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/435232d9d6e68bceac465179e73e0dbf?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kris1290</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/harish-rawat1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">uttarakhand, Congress, BJP, supreme court, uttarakhand news, uttarakhand govt, uttarakhand congress, bjp uttarakhand, uttarakhand news, harish rawat, india news, latest news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>No proof against Sardar Singh: Ludhiana Police</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/no-proof-against-sardar-singh-ludhiana-police-2794355/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/no-proof-against-sardar-singh-ludhiana-police-2794355/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 03:46:12 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 03:46:12 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Divya Goyal]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794355</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Special Investigation Team constituted by the Ludhiana police commissioner to probe the case has found that the duo did not stay overnight at Bhaini Sahib and thus rape allegations by the woman, a UK resident and also a former international hockey player, were \u201cfalse\u201d.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794355&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2776694\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/sardar-759.jpg\" alt=\"sardar singh, hockey, sexual harassment case, sardar singh sexual harassment case, indian express sports\" /> No incident of sexual harassment has been found at Bhaini Sahib.\n<p>NEARLY THREE months after a UK-based woman filed a complaint against Indian hockey team captain Sardar Singh alleging sexual harassment, the Ludhiana police Tuesday said the complaint stands disposed of from their side as no evidence has been found against Sardar during probe.</p>\n<p>The Special Investigation Team constituted by the Ludhiana police commissioner to probe the case has found that the duo did not stay overnight at Bhaini Sahib and thus rape allegations by the woman, a UK resident and also a former international hockey player, were \u201cfalse\u201d.</p>\n<p>Ludhiana police commissioner J S Aulakh said, \u201cNone of the allegations by the woman has been found to be true.

While the final autopsy report is yet to be released, Dr Sudhir Gupta, head of forensic medicine at AIIMS, said: \u201cOur autopsy has ruled out death due to hanging, or suicidal in nature. But the body has been embalmed for so long that it has been mummified. It is not possible to comment on the cause of death.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/after-14-months-and-two-post-mortems-in-saudi-arabia-aiims-negates-saudi-autopsy-not-suicide-2794345/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/sunanda-pushkar-death-case-timeline/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sunanda-tharoor-209.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Sunanda Pushkar death case: Timeline</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/rml-to-conduct-autopsies-soon/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/delhi-ss38.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">RML to conduct autopsies soon</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/drug-overdose-cause-of-sunandas-death-aiims-autopsy-report/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/spt1.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Drug overdose cause of Sunanda&#039;s death: AIIMS autopsy report</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/jind-girls-body-brought-to-aiims-for-third-autopsy/\"><span class=\"text\">Jind girl\u0092s body brought to AIIMS for third autopsy</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/magisterial-probe-ordered-aiims-to-conduct-autopsy/\"><span class=\"text\">Magisterial probe ordered,AIIMS to conduct autopsy</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/cbi-set-to-file-closure-report-in-sachan-case/\"><span class=\"text\">CBI set to file closure report in Sachan case</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>It has been a long, petition-laden fight for the family to get the body back.</p>\n<p>Afsar, 32, came from Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand and was working in Saudi Arabia since 2013 with a private company as a bulldozer operator. He had died sometime after he had last spoken with his wife \u2014 on March 13 last year. His family suspects there could have been foul play, as Afsar had mentioned having had arguments with his employer over leave. \u201cHis employer wanted him to serve out the five-year contract but Afsar was desperate to go home \u2014 he had asked for his passport and pending salary,\u201d Zulfikar Ansari, his elder brother, told <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a>.</p>\n<p>Afsar had assured his wife that he would \u201csort out the issue the following day and return to India by the end of that month,\u201d his brother said.</p>\n<p>Ansari claims Afsar could not be reached on the phone after that. They learnt that he had died only two days later &#8211; when his employer answered Afsar\u2019s phone.</p>\n<p>According to the family\u2019s lawyer, Jose Abraham, the first autopsy conducted in Saudi Arabia had identified hanging as the cause of death. Afsar\u2019s family did not believe he could have hanged himself. \u201cOn April 1, 2015, they wrote to the Union Finance and External Affairs ministers, as well as the Indian embassy in Riyadh, seeking impartial investigation,\u201d Abraham said.</p>\n<p>When that did not help, Afsar\u2019s wife Naushaba Bano moved a petition in Delhi HC on December 22, seeking direction to repatriate his body. The HC directed the Centre and the Indian embassy in Riyadh to \u201censure that the mortal remains&#8230;are transported to India&#8230; and preferably within four weeks\u201d.</p>\n<p>On April 8, 2016, with the body still to be brought back, the family filed a contempt petition in HC. It finally arrived on April 30.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt took us another petition (on May 6) to get permission for his post-mortem. But now we are told that the law does not allow the government to do anything beyond that. How do I explain this to his wife and five-year-old daughter,\u201d Ansari asked while making preparations to take his brother\u2019s body back to his village for burial. The body reached the family\u2019s village late Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794345&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/after-14-months-and-two-post-mortems-in-saudi-arabia-aiims-negates-saudi-autopsy-not-suicide-2794345/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/saudi-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/saudi-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">saudi   480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0627d8e7cec9e0547e60a02771d26bca?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">eshitabhargava</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/saudi-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">suicide, AAIMS, AIIMS delhi, Mohammad Afsar\u2019s death, saudi man death, indian worker death, delhi high court, MEA, indian express news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Kurukshetra murder probes: Shift top officials now, says Punjab and Haryana HC</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/shift-top-officials-now-punjab-and-haryana-hc-to-govt-in-murder-case-2794340/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/shift-top-officials-now-punjab-and-haryana-hc-to-govt-in-murder-case-2794340/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 03:22:31 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 09:09:58 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[India News]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794340</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The court has ordered a CBI probe into the murder of a Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh) resident, allegedly by members of Gau Raksha Dal in Kurukshetra, while he was transporting a buffalo from Shahbad.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794340&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2600766 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/punjab-haryana-hc-759.jpg\" alt=\"kurukshetra, kurukshetra murders, kurukshetra murders investigation, kurukshetra news, Haryana news, Haryana murders, Haryana news, India news\" /> Punjab and Haryana High Court.\n<p>The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed immediate transfer of the Kurukshetra District Magistrate, Superintendent of Police, Deputy Superintendent of Police and Station House Officer of Shahbad police station \u201cto a far-off place at inconsequential posting\u201d.</p>\n<p>In the detailed judgment released Tuesday, the court also ordered a CBI probe into the murder of a Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh) resident, allegedly by members of Gau Raksha Dal in Kurukshetra, while he was transporting a buffalo from Shahbad.</p>\n<p>Justice Fateh Deep Singh had on Monday disposed of a petition moved by a Saharanpur resident Tahir Hassan, who lost his son Mustain (27) in the incident.

MPs usually get three minutes to speak on important issues during Zero Hour. Pratap Singh Bajwa of the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> raised the issue of corruption in transportation of foodgrain in Punjab, which evoked loud protests from Akali members. In the commotion, the timekeeper accidentally allotted an extra three minutes to Bajwa even though he had exhausted his time limit. Although Congress MPs were more than happy to ignore the error, the deputy chairman was quick to spot it. An irked Kurien immediately asked RS staff to find out the person responsible for the mistake.</p>\n<p><strong>Swing Factor</strong></p>\n<p>The crucial vote of two BSP MLAs during the Uttarakhand floor test Tuesday was decided the moment the Supreme Court ruled Monday that nine rebel Congress MLAs will not be allowed to vote. BSP chief Mayawati\u2019s right-hand man Naseemuddin Siddiqui, also the Uttarakhand in-charge of the party, was closely observing the situation. The two MLAs were kept in \u201csafe custody\u201d under his watch. After the court ruling, Siddiqui promptly reached Dehradun with Mayawati\u2019s offer of support. The party had its Plan B ready too, in case the SC had allowed the rebels to vote. In that case, the BSP would then have abstained from voting, it is learnt.</p>\n<p><strong>Penn In The House</strong></p>\n<p>Hollywood actor and former Obama administration official Kal Penn was the toast of the US embassy on Monday, as ambassador Richard Verma hosted a reception for him. Selfies were the order of the day with the actor, known for his roles in the TV show House and the Harold &amp; Kumar film series. Penn was extremely self-deprecatory even as Verma showered lavish praise on his public service record. The actor, whose real name is Kalpen Patel, told the gathering that he wished his mother was in the room. He evoked laughter when he said that his parents will be upset at him for not wearing formals for the event \u2014 which had \u201cbusiness\u201d as the dress code.</p>\n<p><strong>Well-ness advice</strong></p>\n<p>During a discussion on drought in <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> on Tuesday, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab took potshots at the Congress, whose members sat in the well throughout the debate.
