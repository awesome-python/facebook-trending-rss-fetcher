Such is the punishment of Richard Hendricks, the meek engineer-founder of the data-compression startup Pied Piper. At the end of the second season, Richard is booted by his investors from the C.E.O. seat; now, as the third season begins, he has been replaced with the middle-aged, horse-breeding, folksy-seeming \u201cAction Jack\u201d Barker, and moved to a technical role. In last Sunday\u2019s episode, the sales team tells Richard that Jack has gutted his product in the name of future revenue, and Richard storms off to confront Jack, who\u2019s out at the local stables. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he yells, upon entering the barn. \u201cOh, mother of God.\u201d There\u2019s Jack with his arms crossed, and there\u2019s a muscular white stallion, rubbing his cricket bat of a penis against the haunch of Jack\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 breeding mare,\u201d as the aggrieved brown horse is described. \u201cThoroughbreds,\u201d Jack sighs.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hbos-silicon-valley-the-gayest-straight-show-on-tv?mbid=rss\">See the rest of the story at newyorker.com</a></p>Related:<br /><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/let-the-flayings-begin-game-of-thrones-returns\">Let the Flayings Begin! \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Returns</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/the-human-comedy-of-adam-wade\">The Human Comedy of Adam Wade</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/postscript-bill-campbell-1940-2016\">Postscript: Bill Campbell, 1940-2016</a><br />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>The Screening Room: \u201c(Otto)\u201d</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/screening-room-otto?mbid=rss</link>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.newyorker.com/?p=3199887</guid>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Sarah Larson</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 00:00:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[ <p>The delightfully eerie ten-minute animated short \u201c(Otto)\u201d is the second work in our Screening Room series by the Dutch design studio Job, Joris &#38; Marieke, whose Oscar-nominated short \u201c<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/the-screening-room-a-single-life\">A Single Life</a>\u201d was featured here a year ago. \u201cA Single Life\u201d is about a mysterious record album with the ability to control time: move the needle forward or backward and get older or younger, like Alice growing and shrinking, via cake and potion, in Wonderland.
