He replied with his characteristic, straight-faced pessimism. \u201cI find it a lousy deal. There is no advantage in getting older. I\u2019m 74 now. You don\u2019t get smarter, you don\u2019t get wiser ... Your back hurts more, you get more indigestion ... It\u2019s a bad business, getting old.

Cargo is moved from one place to another by molecular machines that have been observed walking on two legs along protein tightropes.

Robert Twilley still vividly remembers the first time he made the trip. The Louisiana State University coastal ecologist piled into a 24-foot Boston Whaler with a bunch of geomorphologists from Minnesota and motored out to an arc of spongy islands along the central coast of Louisiana called the Wax Lake Delta. It was the best place to learn about how a delta develops. The way the land eventually stabilizes and becomes home to a unique ecosystem that changes as the delta gets older is a process that ecologists call succession. \u201cSuccession is one of the most fascinating concepts in ecology,\u201d said Twilley, \u201cthough one of the hardest to study. But in the Wax Lake Delta you can see it all. Biologic communities link up A to Z; it is the holy grail of ecosystem succession.\u201d</p> <p>What is remarkable for scientists like Twilley is that with good muck boots, a small boat, and a non-aversion to intense sun, freak thunderstorms, biting insects, and devastating humidity, the aging process of this new land can be studied in a human lifespan.
