A University of Alberta-based team was part of the research group that looked at the path cancer cells travel in the human body. Tumour cells enter the blood stream, then &amp;#8220;exit&amp;#8221; to another organ or area of the body. This is how cancer cells &amp;#8220;metastasize&amp;#8221; or spread in the body.</description><source>Health</source><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2014 15:46:41 Z</pubDate><enclosure url=\"http://www.calgaryherald.com/cms/binary/10165404.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">tag:www.calgaryherald.com:content=10156552</guid><link>http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/seniors/Tripping+treadmills+Scientists+make+seniors+slip+stop/10156552/story.html</link><title>Scientists make seniors slip in lab to see if it can stop future falls</title><description>Researchers are tripping seniors on purpose, and it&amp;#8217;s not some kind of warped practical joke.
