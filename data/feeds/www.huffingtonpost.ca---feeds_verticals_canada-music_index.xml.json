Estate attorneys unconnected to the case say they have a pretty good idea what's happening, starting with a careful accounting of the megastar's assets, debts and whether any unknown heirs exist.<br />\n<br />\nSome questions and answers about untangling the estate of an artist who industry experts say will continue earning millions after his death:<br />\n<strong><br />\nWHAT'S HAPPENING?</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn the days since Bremer Trust was named special administrator of the estate, the company likely has been tallying up the assets Prince left behind\u2014 financial accounts, real estate, recording catalogue and the unreleased recordings in his vault at Paisley Park. It will also tackle the complicated job of trying to put a value on them. The company has been working to verify who Prince's heirs are and determine what creditors are owed. And it's still trying to dig up any will, trust documents or estate plan.<br />\n<strong><br />\nWHO ARE THE HEIRS?</strong><br />\n<br />\nAssuming there is no will or trust\u2014 and several experts say it's too early to be sure there isn't \u2014Minnesota law is clear on who inherits Prince's estate: his sister Tyka Nelson and his half-siblings. That is, unless it turns out he has an unknown child. Nelson's initial filing identified five surviving half-siblings, but another person, Illinois resident Darcell Gresham Johnston, is claiming to be a half-sister.<br />\n<br />\nCourt papers identify Johnston only as \"an interested party and beneficiary in this matter.\" When asked by The Associated Press whether she's a half-sister of Prince, she replied, \"Yes but no comment.\" She wouldn't say who her parents were.<br />\n<br />\nThe judge authorized genetic testing Friday on a Prince blood sample kept by the medical examiner \"recognizing that parentage issues might arise.\"<br />\n<br />\n<strong>DON'T RICH PEOPLE NORMALLY HAVE WILLS?</strong><br />\n<br />\nLawyers with wealthy clients strongly recommend wills, or trusts, which many prefer because a trust doesn't have to go through probate and can remain secret. That's usually appealing to someone as private as Prince. Los Angeles entertainment lawyer Howard King, who represented Prince from 2011 to 2013, wouldn't say whether he discussed having a proper estate plan with Prince, but said his death has generated a lot of new trust and estate business in the entertainment community.<br />\n<br />\n\"Every one of our artists has very strong ideas about how their intellectual property should be handled, so we do make sure to advise all clients to make sure that if they care about how their property is handled after they pass, they need an estate plan,\" King said. \"And some clients take our advice and some don't.''<br />\n<br />\n<strong>WHAT'S NEXT?</strong><br />\n<br />\nNo hearings are scheduled. Within the next six months, someone is likely to petition the court to appoint a personal representative, who would have authority to make the big decisions. And that could be the beginning of a big fight.<br />\n<br />\nThat petition could come from Nelson, who got Bremer Trust named special administrator. She might ask to be named executor, or another sibling could seek that job. Experts say there's a good chance the court will pick Bremer Trust or another neutral party.<br />\n<br />\nThe court will also have to rule on the company's motion to dismiss as frivolous a claim filed by a California man who contends Prince gave him control over his music catalogue and vault via a verbal agreement in the mid-1990s.<br />\n<br />\nWith so much money at stake, it's a good bet that more claims will come for the court to sort out.

I felt the loss as though he was someone I knew personally; someone important to me. I imagine other people have been feeling similarly. This was an artist so beloved by so many different types of people; from the creative avant-garde to his hometown folks in Minnesota.<br />\n<br />\nIn thinking about what it was that made people love him so much, I came to the conclusion that it was because he was completely and utterly himself. He was always authentic to his vision and unafraid to do things exactly his way. He was someone who was truly free.<br />\n<br />\nI loved the way he turned gender stereotypes on their head. He wore eyeliner, lace, crop tops and high heels. Often, he dressed prettier than me. He played a great game of basketball... in his high heels! He flaunted his sexiness in exactly the way some women do. And yet, women loved him, and married him. And men were comfortable around him. This was an interesting guy.<br />\n<br />\nAnd of course, there was the talent. His music always captured the energy and spirit of the moment so brilliantly. His songs have held up over time, becoming anthems for our youth. We will always be singing, \"Raspberry Beret,\" \"Little Red Corvette,\" \"Lose Control,\" \"1999,\" and \"Purple Rain.\" They're so powerfully associated with their time, and yet these songs are timeless.<br />\n<br />\nAt a time when music is growing ever more boringly formulaic, Prince was an original, writing and performing in exactly the way he wanted. When he was unhappy with the direction in which his label was trying to push him, he gave up his name for a time and became represented first by an unpronounceable symbol, and then by the name, \"The artist formerly known as Prince.\" You've gotta love the guy, if only for doing that.<br />\n<br />\nIn losing Prince, the world has lost not just a brilliant artist and performer, not just a devoted friend, family member and colleague; we've lost another wonderful weirdo, and in these days of mass conformity, this is a true tragedy. There are far too few inspiring oddballs and eccentrics around these days, and that's incredibly sad.<br />\n<br />\nIt's weirdos like Prince who fill the world with all the crazy colours in their head and invite us into their dreams, taking us along on a wild adventure where we get to explore ideas and images that we never would have considered in our ordinary lives. These strange people give the rest of us permission to embrace our own weirdness, and perhaps, to express our own oddball creativity.<br />\n<br />\nOh Prince, you've died much too soon. We'll never forget your passion, your daring, your creative genius and your magical voice filling your music with whispers, growls and screams. You were one of a kind.

The next, I was singing for Justin Bieber.<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps it was jet lag. Perhaps it was the parade of superheroes that casually strolled by me as I donned my Marie Antoinette wig. Either way, it was the most surreal evening of my life. <br />\n<br />\nA few weeks prior, I had been in hair and make up for the Canadian premiere of Mozart's <em>Lucio Silla</em> with Toronto-based opera company, Opera Atelier. The co-artistic director, Marshall Pynkoski, leaned over my make-up chair and asked me if I would be willing to fly back to Toronto from Spain to perform at an event. <br />\n<br />\n\"We're going to have to be quite secretive about planning this,\" he said. \"It is the birthday party of one of our donors and is celebrating the engagement of his friend, Jeremy. Jeremy is Justin Bieber's father. Justin will be there.\"<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><br />\n  <span class=\"quote\">I scanned for the address. \"I think it's the one with the Batmobile,\" I said. And so began my evening singing for the Biebs.</span><br />\n</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nThe afternoon of April 30, my husband picked me up at Pearson Airport, where I had arrived direct from Barcelona. We weaved through the Toronto highways toward the Bridle Path -- I changed shoes, put on lipstick, warmed up my voice in the car. As we turned the corner of one of Toronto's most exclusive neighbourhoods, I scanned for the address. \"I think it's the one with the Batmobile,\" I said. And so began my evening singing for the Biebs.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-04-1462380320-1902821-GPM_6535.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-04-1462380320-1902821-GPM_6535.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-04-1462380320-1902821-GPM_6535-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"380\" /></a><br />\n<em>Photo credit: George Pimentel </em><br />\n<br />\nAndy Curnew and Dr. Rita Kilislian know how to throw a party. As guests were welcomed into their home, they walked a red carpet. The foyer was decorated with large scale, colourful artwork. Graffiti artist Nicholas Sinclair was painting a live commission. The whole evening was carefully curated by Andy with themes of art and pop culture woven throughout. <br />\n<br />\nIt was a mecca of visual titillation. With a new attraction in each corner, the party seemed to effectively reflect our society's need for constant, ever changing stimulus. As an opera singer, I appreciate spectacle. It is not an easy feat to capture the attention of one person, let alone a group. It is an art. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-04-1462379775-1889534-DSC_0375.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-04-1462379775-1889534-DSC_0375.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-04-1462379775-1889534-DSC_0375-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"380\" /></a><br />\n<em>Photo credit: George Pimentel</em><br />\n<br />\nToronto's best and most beautiful sprawled across the couple's property, a large pool canalling the space. Toward the left, a tent with Nyotamoiri or \"body sushi.\" The right, a DJ playing songs far too hip for me to know. Wildly fit women served sashimi and miso-glazed eggplant, rousing within me tinge of guilt for all of the patatas bravas I had scarfed in Spain the week prior. <br />\n<br />\nIn a large tent at the back of the yard, decorated with torches and fire pits, there was a gallery of sculptures and art from some of the world's most famous artists. Rodin sculptures, original Andy Warhol prints, five-foot-tall photographs of early Kate Moss and statuesque paintings by Canadian artist Joanne Corno. As I sauntered past the artwork in my giant, Elsa-from-<em>Frozen</em>-esque ball gown, I felt flattered to be a living art installation amongst the greats.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-04-1462380064-862573-GPM_66641.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-04-1462380064-862573-GPM_66641.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-04-1462380064-862573-GPM_66641-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"380\" /></a><br />\n<em>Photo credit: George Pimentel</em><br />\n<br />\nAfter the acrobats and the fire throwers, we musicians got ready to take stage. Opera Atelier's Pynkoksi took the mic to announce that Andy Curnew and Dr. Rita Kilislian had just made a $25,000 donation to their Toronto-based company. <br />\n<br />\nLet me quickly digress a moment to say one thing: opera is a hard sell. It is a gorgeous, archaic, at-times hard to swallow art form. There is something exotic but inaccessible about what we do. Being relevant to pop culture, to modern society and to current audiences is something we need, and for that, I'm thankful to Andy and Rita for not only their donation but their inclusion. <br />\n<br />\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><br />\n  <span class=\"quote\">I like to think that it was a moment of repose for him, because for a second, someone else was on stage.</span><br />\n</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nMy colleagues, Nicole Bellamy, Chris Enns, Olivier Laquerre and I belted our way through the opera faves. The boys melted hearts with Sondheim, I flounced my way through Puccini's \"Quando m'en vo,\" \"flirting\" with well-dressed strangers and draping myself over the lap of a <em>Dragon's Den</em> star. <br />\n<br />\nSomewhere between <em>La Boheme</em> and \"O sole mio,\" I saw a low-profile, beautifully handsome Bieber peak out from behind an oversized black hoody. I like to think that it was a moment of repose for him, because for a second, someone else was on stage. He seemed intrigued, which is exactly what one could hope for. With high notes and larger-than-life gestures, the set finished, perfectly timed with dusk falling. I couldn't help but wonder if that had been curated as well.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-04-1462379510-375231-GPM_6675.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-04-1462379510-375231-GPM_6675.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-04-1462379510-375231-GPM_6675-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"380\" /></a><br />\n<em>Photo credit: George Pimentel</em><br />\n<br />\nI climbed out of my corset and changed into plain clothes. My wig came off, my hair came down and I was entirely anonymous. As darkness fell upon our extravagant evening, I sat in a sleek poolside chair. I sipped a gin and tonic, leaned back and became an audience member: a voyeur to the those who had just watched me. The gymnasts, the electronic violin player squealing over Journey songs, wild opera patron Mike Wekerle getting a tattoo in the corner created the tapestry for an entirely different type of performance. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-04-1462380160-2122040-GPM_6879.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-04-1462380160-2122040-GPM_6879.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-04-1462380160-2122040-GPM_6879-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"380\" /></a><br />\n<em>Photo credit: George Pimentel</em><br />\n<br />\nThe difference between being an opera singer and a pop star like Justin Bieber is that at the end of the day, you shed your character and go back to being a regular person. The world of opera, so entirely unique and separate from modern society, has managed to exist in its own artistic universe. <br />\n<br />\nOnly time will tell if singing for a superstar will have any impact on my career or life. I encourage and welcome the melding of these worlds, but doubt it may. For now, I will I forge forward in preparation for roles in my world -- singing for opera companies in North America, performing in the Palace of Versailles, my upcoming debut at Lincoln Center. But who knows? Maybe next year I'll be singing for Miley Cyrus. <br />\n<br />\n<em>Meghan Lindsay recently performed the role of Giunia in the Canadian premiere of </em>Lucio Silla <em>with Opera Atelier.

That brought him real happiness,'' Graham said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"larry graham prince\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4280682/thumbs/o-LARRY-GRAHAM-PRINCE-570.jpg?15\" /><em>Larry Graham said it was important to Prince to be able to share scripture. (Photo: AP)</em><br />\n<br />\nGraham said Prince was a private person who didn't discuss his health issues openly. He said he saw Prince three days before he was found dead at Paisley Park and that, besides recovering from a cold, he seemed \"pretty normal.''<br />\n<br />\nA law enforcement official has told the AP that investigators are looking into whether Prince died from an overdose and whether a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks beforehand. The official has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.<br />\n<br />\nGraham said he had never seen Prince take any prescription drugs.<br />\n<br />\nThe two met while playing separate shows in Nashville, Tennessee, in the mid-1990s and Prince asked Graham, who was a Jehovah's Witness, to come on tour with him. Graham said Prince was deeply interested in the Bible and they would talk about it for hours.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"prince\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4268012/thumbs/o-PRINCE-570.jpg?16\" /><em>Bassist Larry Graham said Prince was deeply interested in the Bible. (Photo: CAPmar/MediaPunch/IPX)</em><br />\n<br />\n\"He asked me questions every day, every week \u2014 sometimes we would bring up the sun talking about the Bible,'' he said.<br />\n<br />\nLater, Prince asked Graham if he would move to Minnesota to continue teaching him about God and his faith. He accepted, and Graham and his family relocated from Jamaica, where they had been teaching Bible school.<br />\n<br />\nPrince's interest in the Bible grew and eventually he came to the conclusion that he, too, wanted to become a Jehovah's Witness, Graham said. Later, Prince began worshipping at a Kingdom Hall just outside Minneapolis. Graham said he considered Prince to be his \"spiritual brother.''<br />\n<br />\nIt was important to Prince, like many artists, to give his fans joy with his music, Graham said. But the most important thing to him was not just giving people a \"temporary feeling'' from a record or album but being able to share scripture, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\"His joy \u2014 his biggest joy \u2014 was sharing the hope of everlasting life,'' Graham said. ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4260744/images/s-PRINCE-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/02/workout-songs-may-2016_n_9819956.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[The Best Workout Songs For May]]></title>\n      <author>Joy D'Souza</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/02/workout-songs-may-2016_n_9819956.html?utm_hp_ref=canada-music&amp;ir=Canada+Music</link>\n      <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 11:52:54 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[During a tough workout, music can give you the motivation you need to push past the exhaustion.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you want to quit, psychologist David-Lee Priest tells WebMD <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/exercise-and-music\" target=\"_hplink\">heart pumping beats are the perfect medicine</a>. \"Fast music, especially, can help, because it distracts you from getting tired or wanting to stop exercising.\"<br />\n<br />\nAnd music does more than keep you from quitting \u2014 scientific studies show <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/5799-music-benefits-exercise-studies-show.html\" target=\"_hplink\">cyclists who keep pace with music breathe more efficiently</a> while exercising.<br />\n<br />\nBut if you're a fan of High Intensity Interval Training you might want to try speakers instead of ear buds.

Born and raised in Jamaica, he moved to Toronto in 1973, married and became a citizen. That was then, now he is back living in Jamaica and visits The Big Smoke whenever he can.<br />\n<br />\nSibbles was the lead singer and bass player for <a href=\"http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20131208/ent/ent4.html\" target=\"_hplink\">The Heptones</a> in the 60s and 70s and continues to this day performing in and around the U.S. and the Caribbean. In combination with his work with The Heptones, Sibbles was a session bassist and arranger at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/may/06/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" target=\"_hplink\">Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd's Jamaica Recording and Publishing Studio</a>. <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=felkD8CI97sC&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq=Kevin+O%E2%80%99Brien+Chang+sibbles&source=bl&ots=gPh6ezZa2W&sig=m3E7YtVj9IBsqlR6GrJpg63jy0g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3tZnGorDMAhXntYMKHW97ATQQ6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&q=Kevin%20O%E2%80%99Brien%20Chang%20sibbles&f=false\" target=\"_hplink\">Kevin O'Brien Chang</a> describes him as \"the greatest all-round talent in reggae history\" in his 1998 book <em>Reggae Routes</em>.<br />\n <br />\nThe Heptones were among the most prolific and influential groups of the rock steady era -- they evolved Jamaican ska music into the world phenomenon of reggae. Signature Heptones songs included \"Get In The Groove,\" \"Ting A Ling,\" \"Fattie Fattie,\" \"Got To Fight On To The Top\" and \"Sweeting Talking.\" <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-28-1461810862-936888-Georgespix.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-04-28-1461810862-936888-Georgespix.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-28-1461810862-936888-Georgespix-thumb.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"319\" /></a><br />\n<em> Sibbles' photo George Socka</em><br />\n<br />\nSibbles left Jamaica in 1972 but continued to tour with the group for another four years. After moving to Canada Sibbles established a successful solo career winning a number of record awards, including a Juno.<br />\n <br />\nHe is currently in Toronto visiting friends and family and playing a very rare gig at the Boomer Palace -- the Dundas Street West <a href=\"http://www.lula.ca/\" target=\"_hplink\">Lula Lounge</a>. I caught up with the founding member of the Heptones just before he took to the stage. <br />\n<br />\n\"I used to live in Toronto,\" said the 67-year-old singer and bass player. \"I spent over 20 years here in Toronto, in Canada, so this is where (my headspace) really is. I settled in here for more than 20 years and I went back to Jamaica for 20 years, so we are talking about a 40-year span (in my life). Right now I am living in Kingston, Jamaica and I am here for a Toronto gig.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe \"gig\" that he talks about was a reunion of old-school Canadian reggae performers -- <a href=\"http://www.jaydouglasmusic.com/\" target=\"_hplink\">Jay Douglas</a> (founding member of The Cougars), Ossie D, <a href=\"http://chestermillerreggae.moonfruit.com/#/biography/4552166679\" target=\"_hplink\">Chester Miller </a> (Jamaican/Canadian reggae/dancehall performer) and <a href=\"http://www.knuckledustermusic.com/artist/elaine-shepherd/\" target=\"_hplink\">Elaine 'Lil'Bit Shepherd (</a>2011 Reggae Recording Juno winner). The audience was aging reggae fans who knew the songs and still had the moves on the dance floor.<br />\n<br />\nSibbles says he is blown away by the fact that Toronto is the second largest hub for Jamaican music in the world. He also is quietly pleased that the city has recognized the importance of the music.<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-28-1461810976-2079025-themural.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-04-28-1461810976-2079025-themural.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-28-1461810976-2079025-themural-thumb.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"177\" /></a><br />\n<em>Sibbles' Mural Photograph by Weir</em><br />\n<br />\n\" I was here late last year for (the unveiling of Reggae Alley), a huge mural by Caribbean-Canadian artist<a href=\"http://www.adrianhaylesproductions.com/\" target=\"_hplink\"> Adrian Hayles</a>,\" he said. \"It was not just about me. It was for all the Canadian reggae heroes who were involved in the physical creation of Jamaican music here in Canada.\"<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-28-1461811043-2892888-closeup.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-04-28-1461811043-2892888-closeup.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-28-1461811043-2892888-closeup-thumb.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"400\" /></a><br />\n<em>Photograph by Weir</em><br />\n<br />\n\"I passed it up (the mural) yesterday on Eglinton, and I know it was a tribute to all these guys! We are grateful for this because it is nice to be recognized for things that you have done that are positive.\"<br />\n<br />\nSibbles is getting set to head out on the road again. He has no plans to play in Toronto for the rest of the year because he has his sights set on Africa. But, with his roots here in Toronto, that boomerang effect is always at play, and he knows he will be coming home again soon.<br />\n<br />\n\"Toronto is major for me because I have spent so much time building (my career) here,\" he explains.  But, \"the next place I want to be is Africa. I never been there, I am thinking I would like to go. We are in discussions with some people so I could be there in November for the month.\"<br />\n<br />\nSee a video of my interview with Leroy Sibbles by videographer <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BIwLh2XMtCE\" target=\"_hplink\">George Socka here</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote><strong>Follow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook</strong><br />\n<div class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/huffpostcablogs/\" data-width=\"570\" data-show-faces=\"true\"></div></blockquote><br />\n<br />\n<strong>MORE ON HUFFPOST:</strong><br />\n<br />\n<HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--360221--HH> ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4266820/images/s-LEROY-SIBBLES-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/tasheka-lavann/music-black-issues_b_9790062.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[When You Want To Be Black Without Dealing With Black Issues]]></title>\n      <author>Tasheka Lavann</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/tasheka-lavann/music-black-issues_b_9790062.html?utm_hp_ref=canada-music&amp;ir=Canada+Music</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 07:24:41 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[Thanks to the popularization of rap music -- that has every man, woman and child whipping and nene-ing, dabbing and panda-ing, wanting to be a trap queen or be with a trap queen -- the black culture is being embraced like never before.<br />\n<br />\nAnd with global music icons such as Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna (my wife in my dreams) and Nicki Minaj, all the ladies now want to \"slay,\" \"work\" and purchase a big booty from the nearest plastic surgeon to match their \"anaconda.\"<br />\n<br />\nOn any given weekend, one will find a multitude of non-blacks rocking to these songs and even posting videos showing off their dance moves and rapping/singing skills. Hey Selena! I was at the nightclub recently when Beyonc\u00e9's Formation song started playing and everyone and I mean everyone (black, pink, sparkly...) sang those lyrics like the alphabet song.<br />\n<br />\nI have seen this time and time again with many other songs from black artists that lead to groups of people coming together and having absolute fun despite our cultural, social and economic differences. Each time I would walk away feeling extremely proud. I mean Beyonc\u00e9 had at least half (or more) of the world singing<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\"OK ladies now let's get in formation.\"</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nWell... that was until the \"conversations\" started, which unveiled, for the gazillionth time, the realities of black people all across the earth.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"beyonce\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4250768/thumbs/o-BEYONCE-570.jpg?7\" /><br />\n<br />\nI recently had a conversation with one of my caucasian friends, who not too long ago was singing Beyonce's song with me and the rest and of the world. I made the mistake and began talking about what Bey's latest album <em>Lemonade</em> truly represents within the black community and let's just say, the proud member of the #Beyhive went silent. It was funny and sad at the same time.<br />\n<br />\nThat night I had a conversation with myself and that is how this piece came to life.<br />\n<br />\nWhy do these same \"fans/friends\" disappear when the discussion turns to the deeper messages within such songs? Why do they become so uncomfortable when blacks bring attention to social issues being faced by our own? Why do people who have always praised Beyonc\u00e9 turn around and bash her for owning her blackness. Why is it now a bad song; an inappropriate message; a threat to society? Why do these same \"fans of Beyonc\u00e9's music\" conveniently become silent?<br />\n<br />\nBeyonc\u00e9, who is without a doubt one of the greatest singers of all time with a following that makes President Obama's fan club look like the hair on Donald Trump's head, has been praised over the years for her raw musical talents and songs which have been turned into international anthems. But the moment she starts speaking the truth about the experiences of black people in America and all across the world, she is \"using the race card,\" sending \"anti-police\" messages and is too \"raunchy.\"<br />\n<br />\nThen there are people like my caucasian friend who take pride in having black friends who they can hang out with and listen to all the music from black rappers and singers. Heck, some even go as far as singing the word \"niggas\" as I recently witnessed at Rihanna's Anti World Tour concert in Toronto.<br />\n<br />\nSo again I ask, where are our friends and fans of black music and black people when the partying stops and the subject turns to the reality of being black? When I attend concerts for some of these artists, non-blacks are the ones front and centre, filling more than half of the seats. Switch to a Black Lives Matter march... these folks are nowhere to be found or we're told that, as black people, we complain too much.<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><br />\n  <span class=\"quote\">Beyonc\u00e9 has clearly started another series of important conversations and equally visible are our friends who are all too quiet.</span><br />\n</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nIn 2016, every non-black person wants a black friend. Why? \"Because you guys are super cool!\" Well that's what I learnt some time ago during a discussion with some of my white friends, which had me laughing for days. It didn't bother me one bit because my friends are my friends and we have love for one another and will curse a person out if they ever make the mistake and disrespect one of us. We simply do not see colour!<br />\n<br />\nBut, to many of our so-called \"friends\" and \"fans of black music,\" 2016 is no different than my grandmother's experiences during what was supposed to be the end of racial segregation. It is much like a time when blacks and whites finally started attending college together and interracial friendships developed, but quickly ended after that one white friend stood by in silence as the white boys and girls spat in your face.<br />\n<br />\nBeyonc\u00e9 has clearly started another series of important conversations and equally visible are our friends who are all too quiet.<br />\n<br />\nIf you're my friend or a lover of all people, you won't find my truth offensive, so let me say this with all the love in my heart. You can't hang with us if you're not prepared to hang with us at the next Black Lives Matter march. You cannot go on Snapchat and Instagram to perform all the lyrics and dance moves on <em>Lemonade</em> when you are not prepared to speak up for me and my people when someone says something ignorant like \"Bey's release (of Lemonade) is part of a CIA plot to start a civil war.\"<br />\n<br />\nGet ready to take a stance against the biased legal system that continues to gun down our youth; the prejudiced employment sector; the racist media stations and the bigots who drag black people on social media almost on a daily basis. Don't be silent! Speak up!<br />\n<br />\nIt warms my heart to be living in a time when music continues to bring the world together especially with the rise of technology. Today we can turn on the TV and see Taylor Swift rapping in a commercial or visit social media where you'll find amazing parodies of <em>Lemonade</em> featuring our \"friends.\" That is so cool, right? But are they prepared to stand with black people when it counts?<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote><strong>Follow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook</strong><br />\n<div class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/huffpostcablogs/\" data-width=\"570\" data-show-faces=\"true\"></div></blockquote><br />\n<br />\n<strong>ALSO ON HUFFPOST:</strong><br />\n<br />\n<HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--487654--HH> ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4265642/images/s-BEYONCE-LEMONADE-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
