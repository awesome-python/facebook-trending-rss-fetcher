Nations should be considering the potential impact of temperature rises of much as 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 Fahrenheit), said Robert Watson, former head of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The U.N. panel was assigned to find ways to limit global warming to 1.5C (2.7F) after a 195-nation climate change summit in Paris in December.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/governments-study-worst-case-global-warming-scenarios-former-233631958.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 19:36:31 -0400</pubDate><source url=\"http://www.reuters.com/\">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">governments-study-worst-case-global-warming-scenarios-former-233631958</guid></item><item><title>For first time, scientists grow two-week-old human embryos in lab</title><description>By Kate Kelland LONDON(Reuters) - Scientists have for the first time grown human embryos outside of the mother for almost two full weeks into development, giving unique insight into what they say is the most mysterious stage of early human life.

Farmers on small holdings are responsible for about 30 percent of the logging and destruction of Brazil's vast forests, up from about 23 percent 10 years ago, said Daniel Nepstad, executive director of the California-based Earth Innovation Institute. \"A lack of clear land title pushes small farmers to opt for cattle (rearing) instead of more intensive (food) production\" said Nepstad, a specialist with 30 years of experience tracking Amazon deforestation told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/land-titles-farmers-help-cut-brazils-forest-loss-115936984.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 07:59:36 -0400</pubDate><source url=\"http://www.reuters.com/\">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">land-titles-farmers-help-cut-brazils-forest-loss-115936984</guid></item><item><title>Scientists win $3 million for detecting Einstein's waves</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/scientists-win-3-mln-detecting-einsteins-waves-111749835.html\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/lq9n2CN5J0d99aIL.yLX6g--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztmaT1maWxsO2g9ODY7cT03NTt3PTEzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2016-05-03T111749Z_1_LYNXNPEC420G2_RTROPTP_2_SPACE-GRAVITYWAVES-PRIZE.JPG\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"File photo of Dr. Thorne of Caltech listening during news conference on detection of gravitational waves, in Washington\" align=\"left\" title=\"File photo of Dr. Thorne of Caltech listening during news conference on detection of gravitational waves, in Washington\" border=\"0\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Joseph Ax NEW YORK (Reuters) - Researchers who helped detect gravitational waves for the first time, confirming part of Albert Einstein&amp;#039;s theory in a landmark moment in scientific history, will share a $3 million Special Breakthrough Prize, according to the prize&amp;#039;s selection committee.
