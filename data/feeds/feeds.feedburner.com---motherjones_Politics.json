The 84-year-old worked as Trump's butler for 17 years before becoming the in-house historian at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, the 9/11 Commission's chairman and vice-chairman, &lt;a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/04/27/911-report-28-pages-saudi-arabia-kean-hamilton/83597386/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;argued that&lt;/a&gt; \"the 28 pages were based almost entirely on raw, unvetted material that came to the FBI\" and were more akin to \"preliminary law enforcement notes,\" not solid evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;But Lehman says the report was too lenient on the Saudis, and that the commission saw \"an awful lot of circumstantial evidence\" that Saudi officials, &lt;a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/4/20/11454968/28-pages-saudi-arabia-911\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;likely members&lt;/a&gt; of the kingdom's Islamic affairs ministry, were involved. \"Our report should never have been read as an exoneration of Saudi Arabia,\" he said during his &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; interview.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabian officials have a long history of backing armed fundamentalist movements, from anti-Soviet fighters in Afghanistan during the 1980s to &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/syria-crisis-saudi-arabia-spend-millions-new-rebel-force\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Islamist rebel groups&lt;/a&gt; in the Syrian civil war. The kingdom is also a frequent target of 9/11 conspiracy theorists, who believe the US government helped cover up high-level Saudi complicity in the attacks. Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump has suggested the same thing on the campaign trail. &amp;ldquo;Who blew up the World Trade Center?\"&amp;nbsp;he said during an &lt;a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/donald-trump-suggests-the-saudis-did-911.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;appearance on Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in February. \"It wasn't the Iraqis, it was Saudi&amp;mdash;take a look at Saudi Arabia, open the documents.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/sections/politics\">Politics</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/international\">International</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/secondary-tags/911\">9/11</category>\r\n <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:42:20 +0000</pubDate>\r\n <dc:creator>Max J.

Francis' statement came during a question-and-answer session, during which he was asked to explain the current exclusion of women from serving in ordained roles, especially since women were permitted to be ordained in the early church. One woman asked, \"Why not construct an official commission that might study the question?\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"Constituting an official commission that might study the question?\" Francis responded. \"I believe yes. It would do good for the church to clarify this point. I am in agreement. I will speak to do something like this.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2016/pope-tells-women-religious-vatican-will-study-women-deacons.cfm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Catholic News,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Francis told the group that it was his understanding that women in early scripture were not ordained as permanent deacons, and that he had meditated on the issue with a professor years ago. His announcement on Thursday signaled a historic step that could potentially open the doors for women to serve in that ordained position.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The pope, however, did not comment on the role of women serving as priests, something he has previously rejected as a change that &lt;a href=\"http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/francis-again-rejects-women-priests-without-specific-reasoning\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\"cannot be done.\"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/sections/politics\">Politics</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/religion\">Religion</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/sex-and-gender\">Sex and Gender</category>\r\n <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:44:21 +0000</pubDate>\r\n <dc:creator>Inae Oh</dc:creator>\r\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">303881 at http://www.motherjones.com</guid>\r\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>On Facebook, Trump's Longtime Butler Calls for Obama to Be Killed</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/trump-butler-anthony-senecal-facebook-kill-obama</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Senecal, who worked as Donald Trump's butler for 17 years before being named the in-house historian at the tycoon's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, has repeatedly published posts on his &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/anthonypetersenecal\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; that express profound hatred for President Barack Obama and declare he should be killed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Senecal put up a post that read:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;To all my friends on FB, just a short note to you on our pus headed \"president\" !!!! This character who I refer to as zero (0) should have been taken out by our military and shot as an enemy agent in his first term !!!!! Instead he still remains in office doing every thing he can to gut the America we all know and love !!!!! Now comes Donald J Trump to put an end to the corruption in government !!!! The so called elite, who are nothing but common dog turds from your front&amp;nbsp;lawn are shaking in their boots because there is a new Sheriff coming to town, and the end to their corruption of the American people (YOU) is at hand !!!!

Come on America put your big boy pants on---this election you have a choice---GET YOUR ASS OUT AND VOTE !!!! Thank you !!!!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Though Senecal's Facebook page is public, this message could only be read by his Facebook friends. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones, &lt;/em&gt;Senecal confirms that those were his words: \"I wrote that. I believe that.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Here's a screen shot of the missive:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"inline inline-center\" style=\"display: table; width: 1%\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" class=\"image\" src=\"/files/Screen%20Shot%202016-05-12%20at%201.14.28%20PM.png\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign says, \"This individual has not worked at Mar-a-Lago for many years.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Senecal, who is 84, says he has been employed at Mar-a-Lago since about 1959. Trump acquired the property in 1985, and Senecal remained on staff. \"As [Trump] says, I came with the furniture,\" Senecal remarks. About seven years later, he became the butler for the celebrity mogul who is now the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee. In 2009, Senecal informed Trump he wanted to resign as butler, and Trump persuaded him to stay on as the in-house historian at Mar-a-Lago. There is no salary for the job, Senecal says, but he makes money leading tours of the estate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Senecal regularly posts screeds on his Facebook page from a far-right perspective in which he decries Obama and his wife&amp;mdash;along with Hillary Clinton, other Democrats, and Republican leaders. He often refers to Obama as \"zero,\" and several times he has called for the president's execution. He confirms that he has written all the posts on the page that have appeared under his name. \"It's all me,\" he says.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On April 21, 2015, Senecal railed:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;Looks like that sleezey bastard zero (O) is trying to out maneuver Congress again, if the truth be known this prick needs to be hung for treason!!!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On May 23, 2015, he published a post saying:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;I feel it is time for the SECOND AMERICAN REVOLUTION !!!!! The only way we will change this crooked government is to douche it !!!!! This might be the time with this kenyan fraud in power !!!!! ...[W]ith the last breath I draw I will help rid this America of the scum infested in its government--and if that means dragging that ball less dick head from the white mosque and hanging his scrawny ass from the portico--count me in !!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On June 6, 2015, one of his Facebook friends wrote a comment on Senecal's page saying, \"We need to send the seals to SOROS and ROTHCHILD and REMOVE them and their cronies--then HANG BO and most of Washington--and we'll have a CHANCE to get things straightened out.\" This person added, \"everyone knows they're CRIMINAL - HANG ALL OF THEM.\" Senecal replied, \"I love the idea.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On May 26, 2015, a commenter on the page excoriated Obama and his wife, Michelle (referring to the First Lady as \"Sasquatch\"): \"If he gets hung, then Sasquatch does too.\" Senecal responded, \"Amen....Two of the most DISGUSTING individuals on the face of God's Green Earth !!!!

I think he's a fraudulent piece of crap that was brought in by the Democrats.\" Trump's historian is a birther. Senecal notes that he has been suspended in the past on Facebook for publishing material that violated the service's guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;One recurring theme in Senecal's messages is that Obama is a secret Muslim bent on destroying the United States. On September 18, he wrote, \"Our current 'president' is a rotten filthy muzzie !!!!! Period !!!!!! He continues his war on Christians !!!!!! ...zero is against the people of America !!!!!\" Months earlier, he declared of Obama, \"look at the number of goat screwing muzzies he is degrading our government with !!!!!\" (One of Senecal's Facebook associates replied, \"We need to LYNCH that NIG -- NOW!!\") In another post that day, Senecal suggested Obama was preparing to impose martial law on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On June 6, a commenter on Senecal's page wrote, \"I will gladly fight...to get rid of the commie muzzie and his vp in the white house...[and] we need to get rid of his whole administration and those that support and those muzzies he has put in highly senative positions in our government.\" Senecal answered, \"Exactly, Ruth !!!!!\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In a June 23 message, Senecal complained, \"there are to [sic] many fkn muzzies in America !!!!!\" Two days later, he wrote on Facebook, \"muzzie shits...are invading our country.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On August 12, he published a photo of Obama with this caption: \"If ALLAH HAD AN ASSHOLE IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS.\" On June 18, he referred to Obama as an \"unfeeling sack of camel feces.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Senecal's Facebook timeline is loaded with assorted extremism. A year ago, he derided Clinton: \"Stop the LYING BITCH OF BENGHAZI, NOW---killery clinton !!!!!! She should be in prison awaiting hanging !!!!!!!\" Last summer, Senecal posted an image comparing Obama to Hitler and Lenin. On September 11, he groused about the Iran nuclear deal and assailed \"the treachery of zero, the pig 'president' and traitor ketchup kerry.\" And Senecal has taken shots at the GOP establishment. In a September 7 post, Senecal denounced then-House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and said both were \"FKN CROOKS and should be run out of D.C, on a rail and covered in hot tar.\" A few months prior to that, he proclaimed, \"revolt and hang all of the a-holes in Congress and the crooked government !!!!! Let's get 'er done !!!!!!\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Senecal often has included links to articles about various right-wing conspiracies. On September 14, he cited an article that claimed that Obama \"is leading the Muslim Brotherhood.\" The day before, he had linked to a story from a conservative site claiming that nearly half of Americans would support a military coup against Obama.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;He has regularly published images of the Confederate flag on his Facebook page. And in a May 10, 2015, post, he exclaimed, \"Call me biased, racist...call me anything you want--I could care less !!!!!\" The following month, he wrote on the page that once Obama leaves office, \"only a FEW Negroes and josh earnest will even remember him.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;A lengthy and flattering &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/us/politics/donald-trump-butler-mar-a-lago.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; of Senecal in March noted, \"Few people here can anticipate Mr. Trump's demands and desires better than Mr. Senecal...He understands Mr. Trump's sleeping patterns and how he likes his steak ('It would rock on the plate, it was so well done').\" The story reported that in 1990, Senecal \"took a sabbatical to become the mayor of a town in West Virginia, where he gained some notoriety for a proposal requiring all panhandlers to carry begging permits.\" The article did not mention his Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; did point out that \"Senecal's admiration for his longtime boss seems to know few limits.\" On June 16, Senecal exclaimed on his Facebook page, \"Today, my employer and friend Donald J Trump announced he was running for the Office of President of the United States... NO ONE deserves to run for and be elected to this GREAT office, than Mr. Trump. !!!!!\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is a roundup of screen shots from Senecal's Facebook page:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"DV-container\" id=\"DV-viewer-2830634-Senecal-Facebook-Posts\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=\"//assets.documentcloud.org/viewer/loader.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;\r\n  DV.load(\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830634-Senecal-Facebook-Posts.js\", {\r\n  width: 630,\r\n    height: 450,\r\n    sidebar: false,\r\n    text: false,\r\n    container: \"#DV-viewer-2830634-Senecal-Facebook-Posts\"\r\n  });\r\n&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;\r\n  &lt;a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2830634/Senecal-Facebook-Posts.pdf\"&gt;Senecal-Facebook-Posts (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;\r\n  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2830634/Senecal-Facebook-Posts.txt\"&gt;Senecal-Facebook-Posts (Text)&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/sections/politics\">Politics</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/2016-elections\">2016 Elections</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/right\">The Right</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/top-stories\">Top Stories</category>\r\n <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:40:02 +0000</pubDate>\r\n <dc:creator>David Corn</dc:creator>\r\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">303866 at http://www.motherjones.com</guid>\r\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>Romney on Trump's Taxes: He's Hiding Something</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/mitt-romney-donald-trump-tax-returns</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitt Romney ripped into Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon, claiming that Trump is unfit for the presidency if he doesn't release his tax returns. Romney &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mittromney/posts/10153487016861121\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;took to Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to share his message, saying \"it is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters, especially one who has not been subject to public scrutiny in either military or public service.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Romney's attack comes a day after Trump swatted aside suggestions that he should release his tax returns before the election. \"There's nothing to learn from them,\" Trump &lt;a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/087bc8bc5028405c80fa20cea70be877/ap-interview-trump-narrows-vp-list-he-moves-general\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Associated Press on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Romney disagreed and played the role of armchair psychologist, speculating about Trump's true motivations for refusing to make his records public. \"There is only one logical explanation for Mr. Trump's refusal to release his returns: there is a bombshell in them,\" Romney wrote. \"Given Mr. Trump's equanimity with other flaws in his history, we can only assume it's a bombshell of unusual size.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Romney's own 2012 presidential campaign was &lt;a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/07/corn-msnbc-mitts-still-hidden-tax-returns\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;plagued&lt;/a&gt; by demands from Democrats that he release his tax returns.

Bance noted that Trump was already &lt;a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/11/11655832/donald-trump-sadiq-khan-muslim-ban\"&gt;feuding&lt;/a&gt; with London's newly elected mayor, Sadiq Khan, who is Muslim, and worried that an American president who has vowed to block Muslim immigrants would hurt relations between the countries. \"Turned on the TV [this morning], CNN, and there's Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump is talking about how he's going to make an exception for Mr. Khan,\" Bance said. \"Mr. Khan is the Muslim who is allowed to come into the US if he's won the presidential election!\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the European visitors were not as shocked as Bance. \"We in Europe are really used to the right,\" said Luca Visentini, general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, during one panel. \"It's not something new for us.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I asked Visentini after the panel how closely his compatriots in Europe had been tracking the election. \"Sometimes in Europe we are quite cynical. We see a lot of Mr. Trumps around in different countries, so we're not astonished nor neither shocked,\" he said. \"But we are really very worried.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout Tuesday's panels, the labor leaders discussed various tactics to combat right-wing politicians, like Trump, who stoke the passions of the working class with populist language. The general consensus was that unions both in the United States and around the world need to present clear liberal solutions to their members in order to limit the power of right-wing politicians. \"Politically,\" said Damon Silver, the AFL-CIO's director of policy, \"the neoliberal consensus opened the door to a monster that many had thought had been driven permanently into the outer darkness of democratic politics: the racist, authoritarian right.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/sections/politics\">Politics</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/2016-elections\">2016 Elections</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/secondary-tags/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</category>\r\n <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:00:18 +0000</pubDate>\r\n <dc:creator>Patrick Caldwell</dc:creator>\r\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">303836 at http://www.motherjones.com</guid>\r\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>Elizabeth Warren Mocks Trump on Twitter and Goads Him Into Striking Back</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-tweet</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen.

I disavowed Duke the day before at a major conference.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with Trump's three television interviews that Sunday morning told &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt; that NBC and Fox were in charge of the camera and satellite truck&amp;mdash;a common pool sharing arrangement&amp;mdash;and that the same equipment was used for all three interviews. \"So the notion that some particular earpiece was to blame is not accurate,\" the source said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"section-lead\"&gt;The Photoshop glitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\tLast July, Trump tweeted a photo of himself looking stoic against a backdrop of an American flag and marching soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"&gt;.&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\"&gt;@realDonaldTrump&lt;/a&gt; has deleted the tweet (finally) but here's the pic, Waffen-SS very clear at bottom &lt;a href=\"http://t.co/Kv1GsdKQkw\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kv1GsdKQkw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;mdash; John Schindler (@20committee) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/20committee/status/621031805290987520\"&gt;July 14, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tweet seemed unremarkable, until close observers &lt;a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-nazi-imagery-tweet-2015-7\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that the soldiers used in the image were in fact dressed as Worl War II-era Waffen-SS infantry.

The resolution calls for allowing voters to decide whether the Lone Star State should become an independent nation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Texas was, in fact, its own country for nine years before joining the United States in 1845, and while the idea of returning to independence has never been taken seriously by most people, it remains popular as a romantic notion and marketing hook. Lone Star beer is the \"national beer of Texas.\" &lt;em&gt;Texas Monthly&lt;/em&gt; is the \"national magazine of Texas.\" In a 2009 rally, then-Gov. Rick Perry &lt;a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/06/tsa-bill-texas-secessionists-rick-perry\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;hinted&lt;/a&gt; that the state could secede if \"Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people.\" He later backed off the idea. (Representatives of the state GOP and Texas Nationalist Movement could not be reached for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Texas Nationalist Movement, once considered a quixotic fringe group, has added &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/19/the-texas-secession-movement-is-getting-kind-of-serious/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;hundreds of members&lt;/a&gt; in the years since the election of Barack Obama. According to the &lt;em&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/texas-secession-independence-nationalist-movement-7248746.php\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Dylan Baddour&lt;/a&gt;, at least 10 county GOP chapters are coming to the convention supporting independence resolutions. But this will be the first time in the state's 171-year history that they will actually vote on one. It's very unlikely to win. Then again, that's what people said about Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/sections/politics\">Politics</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/2016-elections\">2016 Elections</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/top-stories\">Top Stories</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/secondary-tags/texas\">Texas</category>\r\n <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 19:09:47 +0000</pubDate>\r\n <dc:creator>Josh Harkinson</dc:creator>\r\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">303806 at http://www.motherjones.com</guid>\r\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>Here Are All the People Bill Kristol Can't Get to Run for the White House</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/here-are-all-people-bill-kristol-cant-get-run-things</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never fear, Americans: neoconservative pundit Bill Kristol has heard your calls for a presidential candidate you can love and respect, and he's on the case.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"&gt;At pizza place in Penn Station: \"You going to get us a better choice?\" \"Doing my best.\" \"We're counting on you.\" &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeightOfWorldOnMyShoulders?src=hash\"&gt;#WeightOfWorldOnMyShoulders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;mdash; Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/730095407204868097\"&gt;May 10, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreaming up fantasy GOP presidential tickets is actually something Kristol does a lot. He's spent much of the last two presidential elections trying to drum up support for alternative candidates to presumptive nominees Mitt Romney in 2012 and now Donald Trump. His pleas have even taken the form of &lt;a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/marvellous-ode/582082\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;terrible poetry&lt;/a&gt;. None of his would-be candidates have actually heeded his calls during the past two elections, but that hasn't stopped him from repeatedly trying. Here's the long list of people Kristol has failed to recruit:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitt Romney:&lt;/strong&gt; Kristol desperately wanted a conservative challenger to Romney in 2012, but this year the former Massachusetts governor is &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/06/mitt-romney-met-privately-with-william-kristol-who-is-leading-the-effort-to-draft-an-independent-bid/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Kristol's latest choice&lt;/a&gt; to stop Trump.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen.

(He does this a lot, including with former generals &lt;a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/clinton-petraeus-2016-predicts-bill-kristol.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;David Petraeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/709963025621630977\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;John Kelly&lt;/a&gt;.)

Kristol wants him to run as an anti-Trump &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/728159633559392257\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;third-party candidate&lt;/a&gt;, but that's &lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/10/donald-trump-winning-over-republicans-as-ben-sasse/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;not going well&lt;/a&gt; so far.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.):&lt;/strong&gt; Kristol has pushed the former Marine and hardcore hawk for &lt;em&gt;two &lt;/em&gt;nominations: Even before he said Cotton should run as an anti-Trump candidate, he wanted the senator to be the vice presidential candidate in a fever-dream &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/643988102554345473\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;ticket with Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;. Cotton hasn't bitten on either suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dick Cheney:&lt;/strong&gt; As previously mentioned, Cheney was Kristol's man for &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/543518989293342720\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a while in 2014&lt;/a&gt; and 2015 before he stopped plugging the idea. Since we're already fighting &lt;a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/02/united-states-war-isis-syria-iraq-libya\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;yet another war&lt;/a&gt; in Iraq, that suggestion may just have been rendered obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitch Daniels:&lt;/strong&gt; Drafting long shots isn't just for 2016! Kristol was disgruntled enough with the prospect of a President Mitt Romney that he repeatedly &lt;a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/exclusive-weekly-standard/617264\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;begged Daniels&lt;/a&gt;, then the wonky governor of Indiana, to reconsider his decision not to run.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.):&lt;/strong&gt; Kristol also &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/us/politics/christie-team-assessing-how-fast-a-2012-campaign-could-be-mounted.html?ref=christopherjchristie\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;tried to pressure Christie&lt;/a&gt; to get into the race in 2012.

The documents, which could be made public as soon as Thursday, may shed light on one of the more colorful&amp;mdash;and allegedly mobbed-up&amp;mdash;individuals Trump has done business with during his long career in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The case involves a man named Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant who worked for a real estate development firm in New York called Bayrock Group, which had an office in the Trump Tower in Midtown. Bayrock was involved in helping develop some of Trump's properties in New York, Florida, and elsewhere, including Trump SoHo in New York City. In 2011, Trump &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/politics/donald-trump-soho-settlement.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&amp;amp;smtyp=cur\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;settled a lawsuit by investors&lt;/a&gt; in Trump SoHo after they discovered, thanks to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/nyregion/17trump.html?_r=2\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that Sater had a long criminal past. In 1993, Sater was sent to prison after slicing open a man's face with a glass during a bar fight. More significant, he was later implicated in a $40 million \"pump and dump\" stock swindle that involved alleged Russian criminals and American mobsters. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering, apparently in exchange for his assistance as a government informant in a mob prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Sater's own criminal record was kept under wraps for years&amp;mdash;until another group of investors sued Bayrock, alleging they had been defrauded. Among the acts of chicanery, they claimed, was the fact that the firm was hiding Sater's criminal past. The investors and their lawyer put many of the documents regarding Sater's criminal history into the public realm in the lawsuit. That disclosure prompted a &lt;a href=\"https://wiselawny.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/judge-2-lawyers-vulnerable-to-contempt-for-referring-to-material-in-unsealed-orders/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;flurry of other litigation &lt;/a&gt;and court action against the investors' lawyers and caused the documents to be sealed on the grounds that their disclosure could put Sater, and future potential informants, at risk or compromise ongoing criminal investigations. &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/nyregion/fraud-case-challenges-secrecy-of-mans-past-as-criminal-and-cooperating-witness.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Those are the documents&lt;/a&gt; the AP has been trying to dislodge from the court.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the documents, many of which have already been leaked, appear pretty innocuous, including a 2000 press release from the Justice Department touting Sater's racketeering plea deal. It's unlikely that many of the records soon to be released directly involve Trump, as most were sealed in attempt to protect Sater from retribution for his informant work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The likely GOP presidential nominee distanced himself from Sater in 2007, after &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/nyregion/17trump.html?_r=2\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the details of his criminal history. However, three years later, Trump gave the man an office and business cards, describing him as a \"senior advisor\" to Trump's organization, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. Sater worked for Trump for about six months, the paper reported, drumming up deals for his organization.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Even if the documents don't reveal more about Trump's relationship with Sater, they should illuminate plenty about one of the \"best people\" Trump says he likes to surround himself with in the course of his business dealings&amp;mdash;and highlight one of the more unsavory episodes of Trump's business career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/sections/politics\">Politics</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/2016-elections\">2016 Elections</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/secondary-tags/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</category>\r\n <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 20:15:24 +0000</pubDate>\r\n <dc:creator>Stephanie Mencimer</dc:creator>\r\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">303791 at http://www.motherjones.com</guid>\r\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>Former Cop Who Shot and Killed Walter Scott Now Faces Federal Charges</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/michael-slager-federal-charges-walter-scott</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former police officer who was filmed fatally shooting Walter Scott, an unarmed black man in South Carolina last year, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on three new charges.

But his legacy still hangs over West Virginia politics.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, his allies helped elect a business-friendly justice, Beth Walker, to the state Supreme Court by pouring at least $2.5 million into the race, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. It's a strange ending to a story that began 12 years ago, when Blankenship spent $3 million to unseat a liberal justice and replace him with a Charleston attorney named Brent Benjamin, who went on to vote to overturn a $50 million judgment against Massey Energy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The US Supreme Court ultimately ordered Benjamin to recuse himself from the case. The whole episode so reeked of corruption that it inspired John Grisham novel and a public financing system for judicial races in West Virginia. But over the course of Benjamin's 12-year term on the bench, Blankenship's allies &lt;a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/west-virginia-supreme-court-blankenship-benjamin\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;determined that Benjamin was not conservative enough and decided to try to replace him with Walker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Last year, Republicans in the state legislature reformed the process for electing Supreme Court justices. Whereas the old system had the political parties nominate candidates for a November election, the new system features a nonpartisan election on the primary election date, allowing a large number of candidates to compete. The result is that the winner need only take a plurality of votes among a potentially divided field. That's exactly what happened on Tuesday. With most precincts reporting by Wednesday morning, Walker &lt;a href=\"http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160510/results-from-tuesdays-races\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;won a 12-year term with about 40 percent of the vote&lt;/a&gt;, followed by liberal candidates Darrell McGraw (the brother of the justice Benjamin beat in 2004) and Bill Wooten. Benjamin came in fourth place, with less than one-third of Walker's vote total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/sections/politics\">Politics</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/2016-elections\">2016 Elections</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/secondary-tags/dark-money\">Dark Money</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/money-politics\">Money in Politics</category>\r\n <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 16:01:01 +0000</pubDate>\r\n <dc:creator>Pema Levy</dc:creator>\r\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">303761 at http://www.motherjones.com</guid>\r\n  </item>\r\n  <item>\r\n    <title>Trump Campaign Corresponded With Its White Nationalist Delegate Long After \"Database Error\"</title>\r\n    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/trump-white-nationalist-california-delegate-response-email-pledge-database-error</link>\r\n    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\"&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt; broke the story that the Trump campaign &lt;a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/donald-trump-white-nationalist-afp-delegate-california\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;had selected William Johnson, a prominent white nationalist leader,&lt;/a&gt; as a California delegate. The Trump campaign responded with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Trump campaign submitted its list of California delegates to be certified by the Secretary of State of California. A database error led to the inclusion of a potential delegate that had been rejected and removed from the campaign's list in February 2016.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Reached again by &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt; late Tuesday, Johnson said he would resign as a delegate if asked to do so by the campaign. \"I accept Trump's explanation,\" he said, regarding the statement. \"I don't want to gainsay the Trump campaign. If I am not removed from the database, I will resign.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Although the Trump campaign blamed a \"database error\" for including Johnson as a delegate, the campaign corresponded with him personally just over 24 hours ago. Trump's California delegate coordinator, Katie Lagomarsino, sent Johnson a congratulatory email on Monday, and when he asked for clarification about how to send his completed pledge form back to the campaign, she replied. Here is the email exchange (with the personal contact information redacted by &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"inline inline-center\" style=\"display: table; width: 1%\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" class=\"image\" src=\"/files/CampaignEmail.png\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt; also has a copy of the pledge form discussed in the email exchange, which Johnson signed and sent to the Trump campaign on Monday.

Anthony List, joined other pro-life women leaders in writing &lt;a href=\"https://www.sba-list.org/home/pro-life-women-sound-the-alarmdonald-trump-is-unacceptable\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Iowa voters to warn against Trump, saying they were \"disgusted\" by his treatment of women.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"America will only be a great nation when we have leaders of strong character who will defend both unborn children and the dignity of women,\" they wrote, poking at Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\" They continued: \"We cannot trust Donald Trump to do either. Therefore we urge our fellow citizens to support an alternative candidate.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;When Trump flip-flopped on abortion in March, first stating that he believed women who got the procedure should be punished, but then backtracking, Dannenfelser told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/03/pro-life-leader-what-do-you-believe-mr-trump-no-one-knows/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Breitbart News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that Trump \"has completely contradicted himself. If this is his position,&amp;nbsp;he has just disqualified himself as the GOP nominee.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;But Trump's rise to becoming the presumptive Republican nominee seems to have inspired Dannenfelser to flip her position on the real estate mogul. On Monday, she wrote &lt;a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/marjoriedannenfelser/2016/05/09/the-prolife-case-for-trump-n2160264\"&gt;an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; for the conservative news site &lt;em&gt;Townhall.com&lt;/em&gt; titled \"The Pro-Life Case for Trump.\" She cites several of his anti-abortion statements from the campaign trail: his promises to defund Planned Parenthood, to appoint anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court, and to support Congress' proposed 20-week abortion ban, which failed in September 2015 but is being debated again this term.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;She writes that it is important to oppose Hillary Clinton, whose promise to fund Planned Parenthood, according to Dannenfelser, is \"the most dramatic pro-abortion position espoused by a leading political figure to date.\"&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Abortion care makes up about &lt;a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/planned-parenthood-at-a-glance\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;3 percent&lt;/a&gt; of health services provided annually by Planned Parenthood.) Dannenfelser concludes, \"We believe Mr. Trump, who has already taken strong positions on the life issue throughout the primary campaign, will join us on offense.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"A few weeks ago, they were crying foul that Donald Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t adhere to anti-choice orthodoxy,\" Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-sba-list-abortion_us_5731f3dfe4b0bc9cb0480225\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. \"Now, Susan B.

If the feds make good on their threat, the University of North Carolina stands to lose more than $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Why is everyone suddenly so fired up about bathrooms and gender?

It's a small and overwhelmingly white&amp;mdash;in fact, at 93 percent white, it's the third-whitest state in the country, according to &lt;a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-may-win-big-in-west-virginia/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Independents were permitted to vote in the Democratic primary, and Sanders has done well in contests open to independents, whereas Clinton has won most primaries restricted to Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Recent polls showed Sanders leading by an average of &lt;a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/wv/west_virginia_democratic_presidential_primary-5425.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;six points&lt;/a&gt; in the state. The major networks called the race with a quarter of the votes counted.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;But Sanders' win is not enough to make up ground in the delegate count. West Virginia has only 29 delegates, which will be allocated proportionally. Before Tuesday night, Clinton led Sanders by 290 in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/primary-calendar-and-results.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;pledged delegate count&lt;/a&gt;. When superdelegates are included, that lead grows by another 484 delegates. In order for Sanders to overtake Clinton, he will need many of those superdelegates to abandon Clinton and support him instead. And he'll need to win bigger states than West Virginia, and by bigger margins.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On the Republican side, presumptive nominee Donald Trump won handily in West Virginia. Even before his last two rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, left the race last week, polls in West Virginia &lt;a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/wv/west_virginia_republican_presidential_primary-5423.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; the real estate mogul with a lead of more than 30 points.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Trump also easily won the Republican primary in Nebraska on Tuesday. Nebraska's Republican governor, Pete Ricketts, recently endorsed Trump, while the state's junior senator, Republican Ben Sasse, is among the &lt;a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-trailguide-05052016-republicans-and-democrats-failed-time-for-a-third-1462454967-htmlstory.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;most vocal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/heres-are-elected-republicans-who-wont-back-trump\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;anti-Trump members of Congress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</description>\r\n     <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/sections/politics\">Politics</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/primary-tags/2016-elections\">2016 Elections</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/tags/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/secondary-tags/bernie-sanders\">bernie sanders</category>\r\n <category domain=\"http://www.motherjones.com/category/secondary-tags/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</category>\r\n <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 01:31:30 +0000</pubDate>\r\n <dc:creator>Pema Levy</dc:creator>\r\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">303706 at http://www.motherjones.com</guid>\r\n  </item>\r\n  </channel>\r\n</rss>\r\n",
