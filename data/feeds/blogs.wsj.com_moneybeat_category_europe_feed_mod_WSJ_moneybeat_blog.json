By late afternoon, it was up by only around 0.10% at $1.44.</p>\n<p>The BOE\u2019s sterling exchange rate index, which tracks the average strength of the pound against a basket of other currencies, has declined by around 9% since its peak in November.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the central bank said that around half of that dip is due to the uncertainty surrounding the referendum on\u00a0June 23.</p>\n<p>That suggests the currency is much weaker than it would have been without the prospect of this vote, meaning that it could snap higher if the U.K. votes to remain.</p>\n<p>[wsj-responsive-image P=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ562_BOEPOU_P_20160512092132.jpg\" J=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ562_BOEPOU_J_20160512092132.jpg\" M=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ562_BOEPOU_M_20160512092132.jpg\" caption=\"\" credit=\"\" placement=\"Inline\" suppressEnlarge=\"false\" ]</p>\n<p>Working out precisely how much of the recent fall in the pound is down to the referendum is a difficult task, but it matters enormously for how volatile the currency will be around the\u00a0June 23\u00a0vote.</p>\n<p>After its own calculations, the BOE issued a range of forecasts, based on different estimates of what proportion of the currency\u2019s recent decline is down to the shadow cast by the referendum.</p>\n<p>If all the fall since November was caused entirely by the referendum, the BOE\u00a0suggests sterling would end the year down by just 1.2%, if the U.K votes to remain. That implies a significant rise in the pound once the uncertainty is lifted.</p>\n<p>But if worries about the\u00a0referendum haven\u2019t actually had a major impact on the pound, and the decline has been due to other factors \u2014 like signs of a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-data-point-to-economic-slowdown-1461229514?tesla=y\">slight economic slowdown</a>\u00a0\u2014 then the Bank estimates that\u00a0the pound would\u00a0end the year 10.7% lower than it began. That\u2019s if the British vote to stay in the European Union.</p>\n<p>The gap between a decline of 1.2% and one of 10.7% is a large one for the foreign exchange market. It also impacts the BOE\u2019s forecasts for inflation, with a strengthening\u00a0pound meaning lower prices for goods from abroad.</p>\n<p>If the BOE is right to attribute half of sterling\u2019s decline over the last six months\u00a0to the referendum, and the U.K. votes to remain,\u00a0that 4.5% decline should reverse pretty quickly.</p>\n<p>But what happens to the pound if the U.K. votes to leave?

But what happens if the U.K. decides to leave the European Union? How will this affect bankers and fund managers?</p>\n<p>Lots is unknown, of course, and while estimates are being made by both sides on the cost to the economy, to jobs and competitiveness, those estimates vary widely. So what do we really know?</p>\n<p><strong>First, what is the EEA and why does it matter to this debate?</strong></p>\n<p>The European Economic Area is the glue that binds the European Union together. It allows free movement of people and trade throughout the 28 EU member states (plus a few honorary extras).</p>\n<p><strong>So it\u2019s like having a business passport?</strong></p>\n<p>Right. Being in the EEA allows financial firms the ability to work in European member states without needing local authorization from every single local regulator. If you\u2019re authorized in one market, you\u2019re authorized in all.</p>\n<p>According to the European Banking Authority, over 2,000 U.K. investment firms have outbound passporting rights.</p>\n<p>Passporting rules have helped London grow as a financial services hub. It makes life easier if you can offer a host of cross-border services from one location.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens in the event of a Brexit?</strong></p>\n<p>In the event of a vote to Leave, there are two main scenarios. The U.K. could end up leaving the EEA entirely, and would then have to broker bi-lateral relationships that govern its relationship with the EU, similar to Switzerland\u2019s relationship.</p>\n<p>The alternative is that it stays part of the EEA, and therefore remains subject to EU regulations but has no say on how they are formed. This is similar to the relationship Norway and Iceland have with Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>What would happen to banks and fund managers?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a whole host of services that will be affected; who you can lend to, who you can market to, even who you can advise.</p>\n<p>If the U.K. left the EEA, a bank or fund manager would have to gain local licences for all countries they wished to do business in. If they want a new passport for the EEA, they may also have to move the bulk of the relevant business to an EEA jurisdiction in order to qualify.</p>\n<p>However, there are a number of areas where, if a non-EEA country has similar rules, then European legislators can permit business to continue without a sizable disruption.</p>\n<p>For example, European regulation for fund managers can be extended to non-EEA managers, as long as they adhere to the existing rules, and get permission from a regulator in the EEA.</p>\n<p><strong>So there is a chance things can just continue as normal?</strong></p>\n<p>Well. If the U.K. promises to keep the same regulations, many problems may be avoided.</p>\n<p>However, the U.K. has always been keen to tailor laws to suit its financial sector. It has recently fought the EU on issues such as bonuses, trading taxes, and clearing rules for pension schemes. If the U.K. begins to change its own financial regulation, this may make it harder to convince the EU to keep things the way they are.</p>\n<p>There are also areas where rules for non-EEA states have not been sorted out, such as deposit taking or custody services.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the problem of disputes. If the fund manager did receive a non-EEA passport, any legal dispute with investors in the EEA would have to be heard and settled in an EEA law court, not the U.K.</p>\n<p><strong>What about how you make a trade? Surely that won\u2019t change?</strong></p>\n<p>At present, a large amount of euro-denominated trades are cleared in London.</p>\n<p>Following Brexit, the European Commission could force all euro-denominated trades to be cleared and settled in the eurozone.</p>\n<p>Last year the U.K. won a legal battle against the ECB after the EU general court found that the ECB did not have the \u201ccompetence necessary to regulate the activity of securities clearing systems.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the time, the ECB said it would look into ways of challenging the ruling. Brexit might prove a good opportunity to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it a big deal if clearing houses are moved?</strong></p>\n<p>That depends. Clearing houses are increasingly important parts of the financial plumbing, acting as a middle man between trades, holding collateral in case one side of the trade goes bust. Think of them as shock absorbers.</p>\n<p>London is home to some of the biggest clearing houses, including facilities operated by the London Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange and CME. They are currently allowed to offer clearing services for customers across the EEA and in euro-denominated products. In the case of Brexit, U.K. clearing houses could only provide services within the EEA if they are subject to rules deemed equivalent to those in the EEA. Getting such approval would not be an overnight process.</p>\n<p>There is also insolvency law to consider. If a buyer or seller goes bust and their trades are unsettled, then the clearing house\u2019s national bankruptcy law comes into play when deciding who gets re-paid. The U.K. law is seen as one of the most favorable to lenders, German or French law less so.</p>\n<p><strong>Will lots of jobs have to move from London to the EU?</strong></p>\n<p>Some people think so. U.K. Treasury chief\u00a0George Osborne, a leading figure in the campaign against Brexit, has warned there could be \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of potential job losses.</p>\n<p>Xavier Rolet, head of the London Stock Exchange, has said up to 100,000 jobs could be lost from London\u2019s financial sector. HSBC has said it might shift 1,000 staff to Paris in the event of a Brexit.</p>\n<p>Some estimates seem high. There are currently around 360,000 employed in financial services in London, as of 2014, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p>\n<p>However, given the uncertainty, any numbers are difficult to predict. European firms may have to build up their subsidiaries in London. This could act as a counterbalance.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-brexit-and-finance/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<media:group><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_A_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_C_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_D_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_E_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_F_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_G_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_P_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_J_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_M_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_ER_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_FR_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_GR_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NZ571_Brexit_AM_20160512094727.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></media:group>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Online Fashion: Strong Growth, But Can It Make Money?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/12/online-fashion-strong-growth-but-can-it-make-money/?mod=WSJ_moneybeat_blog</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/12/online-fashion-strong-growth-but-can-it-make-money/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:57:43 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Stephen Wilmot]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Overheard]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Stocks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Asos]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Heard on the Street]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Online Fashion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Online retail]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Zalando]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/?p=49548</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Europe\u2019s largest online fashion retailer blamed the strong dollar and bad weather for disappointing results\u00a0Thursday.

Officials with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, say the contest won\u2019t settle down until geopolitical rifts in the Middle East cool.</p>\n<p>Saudi Arabia\u2019s rivalry with Iran has contributed to violent conflicts in Syria and Yemen and made it nearly impossible for OPEC to agree on tactics to raise crude prices. Russia has managed to keep its European market share steady in 2014 and 2015, while Saudi Arabia has slipped.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/aramco-aiming-to-double-gas-production-in-10-years-1462864819\">plans to nearly double</a>\u00a0its gas production\u00a0<span>in 10 years</span>, Chief Executive Amin Nasser said.

Seeing the devastation \u201cwas really quite overwhelming in some spots,\u201d Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said after touring the town.</p>\n<p>She said one of the issues she would discuss with energy executives is housing for oil-sands workers subject to evacuation orders, some of whom have lost their homes. Fort McMurray and much of the surrounding area are inaccessible to workers in the oil-sands industry, and many oil producers have reduced their crude output, with at least 645,000 barrels a day now cut, more than a quarter of daily production.</p>\n<p><strong>SHELL EVACUATES NON-ESSENTIAL STAFF FROM NIGERIA FIELD</strong></p>\n<p>Royal Dutch Shell PLC\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/shell-evacuates-non-essential-staff-from-nigeria-field-1462805125\">evacuated nonessential staff</a>\u00a0from one of its Nigerian oil fields amid mounting militancy in the country\u2019s oil-rich Niger Delta region, Sarah Kent reports. The move follows an attack on one of Chevron Corp.\u2019s offshore facilities last week that knocked out 35,000 barrels a day of the company\u2019s oil production.</p>\n<p><strong>MARKETS</strong></p>\n<p>Oil prices gained on Tuesday, with supply outages from Canada to Nigeria helping to alleviate the global glut of crude.</p>\n<p>Wildfires in Canada\u2019s oil-rich Alberta province have knocked off some 1.6 million barrels a day according to consultancy Energy Aspects. Several companies including Suncor, BP, and Phillips 66 have declared force majeure on Canadian crude.</p>\n<p>According to analysts at Commerzbank, the outages in Canada will contribute to tightening supply on the North American market and could lead to a decline in U.S. crude oil stockpiles in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Read our latest market report at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-prices-rise-supply-outages-in-focus-1462871742\">wsj.com</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/10/saudi-arabian-fight-for-oil-market-intensifies-energy-journal/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<media:group><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_A_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_C_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_D_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_E_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_F_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_G_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_P_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_J_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_M_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_ER_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_FR_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_GR_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CP563_SKYBOX_AM_20160509200854.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></media:group>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>WSJ City: Credit Suisse Swings to a Loss, Bookings Slow at easyJet</title>\n\t\t<link>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/10/wsj-city-credit-suisse-swings-to-a-loss-bookings-slow-at-easyjet/?mod=WSJ_moneybeat_blog</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/10/wsj-city-credit-suisse-swings-to-a-loss-bookings-slow-at-easyjet/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 06:54:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Giles Turner]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Banks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Deals]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Stocks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Breakfast Briefing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Morning MoneyBeat Europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[WSJ City]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/?p=49442</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Good morning from London.

Elsewhere in Asia, shares were choppy though the Nikkei surged after Japan\u2019s finance minister reiterated his stance on currency intervention.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 600\">Stocks to Watch:\u00a0</span></p>\n<div style=\"color: #222222\"><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> swings to loss; <strong>Nokia</strong> falls to surprise loss; <strong>Munich Re</strong> cuts 2016 after-tax profit guidance; <strong>easyJet</strong>\u00a01H pretax loss \u00a324m; <strong>Capita</strong> has solid start to 2016.</div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222\"></div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222\"><span style=\"font-weight: 600\">Coming Up:</span>\u00a0The Office for National Statistics issues UK trade data for March, while the REC/KPMG report on jobs is also published.</div>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>WSJ City Event:</strong>\u00a0Come and hear top investors discuss navigating turbulent markets at WSJ City\u2019s first panel discussion, on June 9 at The News Building, next to The Shard, from 7am. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wsj-city-investing-in-a-turbulent-world-tickets-21035634148\">Sign up here.</a></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WSJCity\">@WSJCity</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 600\"><em style=\"font-weight: 400\">Please feel free to share this newsletter with friends and colleagues.\u00a0If they want to sign up,\u00a0<a style=\"color: #0080c3\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/newsletters\">they can do so here.\u00a0</a></em></span></p>\n<p>You can unsubscribe\u00a0<a style=\"color: #0080c3\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/newsletters\">here.</a></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/10/wsj-city-credit-suisse-swings-to-a-loss-bookings-slow-at-easyjet/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<media:group><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_A_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_C_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_D_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_E_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_F_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_G_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_P_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_J_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_M_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_ER_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_FR_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_GR_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY489_easyjg_AM_20160510022334.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></media:group>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Krispy Kreme to Exit Public Markets After 16 Years of Hot and Cold</title>\n\t\t<link>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/09/krispy-kreme-to-exit-public-markets-after-16-years-of-hot-and-cold/?mod=WSJ_moneybeat_blog</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/09/krispy-kreme-to-exit-public-markets-after-16-years-of-hot-and-cold/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 14:26:50 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kevin Kingsbury]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Deals]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[U.S.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[JAB Holdings]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Krispy Kreme]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/?p=49427</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Krispy Kreme will get a chance to get its act together away from the glare of the public markets.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than a decade ago, shares of <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/KKD\">Krispy Kreme Doughnuts</a> were about as hot as the company\u2019s fresh-out-of-the-oven doughnuts, which stoked lines around the block.</p>\n<p>But the fascination wore off as the Southeast-focused chain\u2019s goods became pervasive\u2014along with its stores. The overexpansion landed the company in trouble, and there was\u00a0some question about whether Krispy Kreme could make it through the financial crisis.</p>\n<p>Shares, which almost got to $50 in 2003, bottomed in 2009 at $1.01. They then briefly breached $25 in late 2013 before pulling back anew amid inconsistent results.</p>\n<p>[wsj-responsive-matterhorn-chart id=0]</p>\n<p>Now Krispy Kreme will be able to get its act together away from the glare of the public markets. The company is set to become the latest U.S. consumer firm to <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/krispy-kreme-to-be-acquired-by-jab-for-1-35-billion-1462798137\">come under the umbrella of German company JAB Holding Co</a>.</p>\n<p>For the firm\u2014which manages the wealth of one of Germany\u2019s wealthiest families, the Reimanns\u2014agreeing to pay $1.35 billion for Krispy Kreme comes soon after JAB led the acquisition of Keurig Green Mountain. It goes without saying that myriad synergistic possibilities come to mind for a doughnut chain and the coffee firm and JAB\u2019s already-owned Peet\u2019s Coffee & Tea. It\u2019s also apropos that Keurig has been undergoing its own hangover as its in-home brewing machines became ubiquitous.</p>\n<p>(<strong>RELATED:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/09/meet-jab-the-german-company-buying-krispy-kreme/\">Meet JAB, the German Company Buying Krispy Kreme</a>)</p>\n<p>But before thinking about combined Krispy Kreme-Keurig efforts, the former needs to get its house in order as sales have been slowing at international locations\u2014which make up more than 70% of the company\u2019s store count.</p>\n<p>The $21-per-share price tag is a level Krispy Kreme last traded at barely a year ago; it closed Friday at $16.86.</p>\n<p>Other JAB holdings include beauty-products maker <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/COTY\">Coty</a> and shoemaker <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/CHOO.LN\">Jimmy Choo</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/09/krispy-kreme-to-exit-public-markets-after-16-years-of-hot-and-cold/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<media:group><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_A_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_C_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_D_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_E_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_F_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_G_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_P_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_J_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_M_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_ER_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_FR_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_GR_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NY023_krispy_AM_20160509101402.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></media:group>\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
