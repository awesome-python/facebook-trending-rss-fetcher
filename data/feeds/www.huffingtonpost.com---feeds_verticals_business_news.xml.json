Apple recently has come under pressure from Chinese regulators, with its online book and film services shut down last month, and Cook is traveling to the country this month.</p><br />\n<p>The investment gives Apple, which has hired dozens of automotive experts over the past year, a sizeable stake in Uber Technologies Inc's chief rival in China. Cook said in an interview that he sees opportunities for Apple and Didi Chuxing to collaborate in the future.</p><br />\n<p>\"We are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market,\" he said. \"Of course, we believe it will deliver a strong return for our invested capital over time as well.\"</p><br />\n<p>Didi Chuxing, formerly known as Didi Kuaidi, said in a statement that the funding from Apple was the single largest investment it has ever received. The company, which previously raised several billion dollars, dominates the ride-sharing market in China. The company said it completes more than 11 million rides a day, with more than 87 percent of the market for private car-hailing in China.</p><br />\n<p>Investors are eagerly watching to see whether Apple will enter the automotive business. Apple has hired a wide range of automotive experts, and the company is exploring building a self-driving car, sources have told Reuters.</p><br />\n<p>Cook said Apple remains focused on the in-car experience with its CarPlay system that links smartphones to vehicle infotainment systems.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;That is what we do today in the car business, so we will have to see what the future holds,\" he said.</p><br />\n<p>Although Apple's sales in China have slumped amid slowing economic growth there, Cook stressed he remains confident in the market.</p><br />\n<p>The deal \"reflects our excitement about their growing business ... and also our continued confidence in the long term in China&rsquo;s economy,\" Cook said.</p><br />\n<p>(Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Leslie Adler)</p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/57353df922000057072567e8.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/education-department-student-loans_n_9940458.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[An Obama Policy 'To Protect Students And Taxpayers' Is In Danger Of Not Happening]]></title>\n      <author>Shahien Nasiripour</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/education-department-student-loans_n_9940458.html?utm_hp_ref=business&amp;ir=Business</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:17:46 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<br />\n<p><a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2009/ge-faq.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Obama administration has promised to punish for-profit colleges that produce graduates who can't afford their student loan payments.

So, in 2010, the Obama administration finalized new rules that eliminated Bush-era loopholes to Clinton-era rules that banned schools from paying bonuses to recruiters based on how many students they enroll.</span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But FSA and the Education Department failed to rescind a Bush-era directive that the department&rsquo;s </span><a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oig/auditreports/fy2015/a05n0012.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inspector general said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> discouraged FSA employees from punishing schools that violated the ban.

Schools can challenge the inclusion of certain graduates in their totals or the department&rsquo;s figures for their loan balances, among other information.</p><br />\n<p>Colleges have three major opportunities to appeal their figures -- the Education Department&rsquo;s list of their career programs&rsquo; graduates, those students&rsquo; reported debt levels, and earnings information for the typical graduate.</p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schools have 45 days to appeal each of the first two sets of data, and 60 days to appeal the final figures. Each set of appeals forces the department to manually check its numbers, delaying the rule&rsquo;s bite. Final federal figures </span><a href=\"https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN1512.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">won&rsquo;t be made public</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while schools&rsquo; appeals are pending.</span></p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t lose anything to appeal,&rdquo; one industry source said of colleges&rsquo; motivations.</p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=04313d6392576d1d41abdf697527fd7c\">Fewer than 20 Education Department employees</a>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are expected to evaluate document-heavy appeals, federal contracting records show.</span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the figures -- such as graduates&rsquo; loan balances -- are littered with errors.

The restaurant chain announced that food prices would rise in those locations to cover higher labor costs, and in turn,&nbsp;the average employee's<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joes-crab-shack-tips-tipping_us_5642f9dde4b045bf3decfb76\"> $2-an-hour plus tip wage</a> would rise to $12 an hour.</p><br />\n<p>The problem is, nobody believed them.</p><br />\n<p>Bob Merritt, the shack's new chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/business/joes-crab-shack-tried-getting-rid-of-tips-it-didnt-last-long.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">told investors last week</a> that both customers and employees weren't happy with the policy, according to The New York Times. Company research found that diners hated the price hikes, and 60 percent disliked the new tipping policy -- they were happy to throw a little extra cash toward their wait staff as an incentive for a better experience.</p><br />\n<p>\"The system has to change at some point, but our customers and staff spoke very loudly,\" Merritt told the Times. \"And a lot of them voted with their feet.\"</p><br />\n<p>Those 18 locations lost 8 to 10 percent of their customers, and former CEO Raymond Blanchette <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/12/pf/joes-crab-shack-ends-no-tipping-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">told CNNMoney</a> that some employees quit over the policy.</p><br />\n<p>Now Joe's Crab Shack is rolling back its plan, decreasing prices at 14 locations but keeping the no-tip measure at four locations as a continued experiment.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;We are going to try to figure out why it worked in some places and why not in others,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://nrn.com/latest-headlines/joe-s-crab-shack-cuts-back-no-tipping-test\" target=\"_blank\">Merritt told Nation's Restaurant News</a>. &ldquo;The way we look at it is: We are really continuing the tests in place with where it works.&rdquo;</p><br />\n<p>Other, smaller ventures have also tried to implement similar policies and failed.

Sunlight poured in through the windows. Outside, tour boats swished through the Hudson River.</p><br />\n<p>This was an odd setting for an \"<a href=\"http://www.insidedarkweb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Inside the Dark Web</a>\" conference, with talk about cybercrime and anonymized \"<a href=\"http://www.onion-router.net/Summary.html\" target=\"_blank\">onion routing</a>\" on the Internet. But any daydreaming about the nice weather was halted toward the end of Syverson's keynote,&nbsp;when he mentioned an emerging threat to people's online privacy.</p><br />\n<p>\"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medical identity theft is poised to take over as the primary form of identity theft,\" Syverson said.</span></p><br />\n<p>It's already a big problem. More than <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2016/05/05-patient-privacy-preventing-future-failures-yaraghi\" target=\"_blank\">155 million Americans</a> have potentially had their medical data exposed in the last six years alone, the Brookings Institution says. That's largely because hospitals and other organizations aren't doing their part to secure patients' data. But individuals are <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3994614/online-doctor-visit-increase/\" target=\"_blank\">increasingly using online health care services</a>, which means they're responsible in part for making sure their connections are secure.</p><br />\n<p>Tor can help with that. The service's downloadable software routes online traffic in a way that helps users stay anonymous when navigating the Internet.&nbsp;It's thus helped create a \"dark web,\" a network of sites that are inaccessible via Google Search, say.</p><br />\n<p>Syverson spent much of his talk explaining the technology that makes Tor work, but he mentioned identity theft to illustrate why the browser is increasingly relevant to anyone with an online presence.</p><br />\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en\" target=\"_blank\">People who know how to use the service</a>&nbsp;can avoid being tracked by bad actors, protect themselves from government surveillance and so on. Syverson compares Tor to encryption -- a once controversial security measure that's commonplace today: Roughly 15 years ago, before cyberattacks and massive data dumps seemed like weekly occurrences, people tended to be skeptical about the necessity of encrypting information online. Many people today are similarly dubious about the need for a service like Tor, Syverson said.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;Back then, if you were encrypting your website, people were like, &lsquo;Oh, what do you have to hide?&rsquo; And now it&rsquo;s recognized as a fundamental enabler of eCommerce,&rdquo; he added.</p><br />\n<p> &nbsp;<strong><em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-the-dark-web_us_55d48c50e4b0ab468d9f17d7\" target=\"_blank\">More:&nbsp;</a></em></strong><em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-the-dark-web_us_55d48c50e4b0ab468d9f17d7\" target=\"_blank\">What You Should Know About The &lsquo;Dark Web,&rsquo; An Anonymous Haven For Hackers</a></em></p><br />\n<p>Syverson referenced a health care NGO that is developing a site on the dark web for \"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anonymous online drug tests, anonymous online health services, anonymous online chat, anonymous research questionnaires for health.\" He wouldn't name it because the project is still in development, but the takeaway was clear: In the era of mass online communication, anonymous browsing can be responsible browsing. You obviously wouldn't want a hacker to access your medical records, after all.</span></p><br />\n<p>Of course, anonymous browsing and the dark web are infamous for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-untold-story/\" target=\"_blank\">enabling crime</a>, as well.</p><br />\n<p>\"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are bad guys that use this, too, just like there are bad guys that use cell phones, hammers and lots of other things,\" Syverson said.</span></p><br />\n<p>Asked by The Huffington Post whether Tor and the dark web should be more accessible for the average person, he offered a shrug.</p><br />\n<p>\"I<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t's not hard at all.

The most glaring issue she says she faced early on in her career was not having access to or knowledge of the people of color who were in leadership positions in her field that she could reach out to for mentorship and guidance. </span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson decided to change that and she did with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.colorcommnetwork.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the creation of ColorComm.</a></span></p><br />\n<br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday marks five years since Wilson launched ColorComm, which she calls the first and only nationwide network of women of color in communications that provides them with professional advice, guidance and resources to encourage them to create connections that will help them get ahead in their careers. </span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"When I was thinking about launching ColorComm, I was 25 and I looked around where I worked and didn't see people of color in leadership positions and was wondering how I was going to be able to carve out my trajectory in communications if I didn't have people to look up to at the executive level,\" Wilson told The Huffington Post. </span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"You really need a support system when you're navigating your way through communications and it doesn't happen formally,\" she added. \"You kind of just have to figure out how to get there on your own.\"</span></p><br />\n<br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the first year of the organization's launch, Wilson hosted invite-only luncheons with senior executives from various companies and brought women together to meet, mingle and learn from one another.</span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"W</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hat I thought was why don't we get all these women together in one room and show them how to develop mutually beneficial relationships,\" Wilson said. </span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The luncheons quickly grew and within a year, ColorComm transitioned into a paid membership organization with 40 members based out of Washington, D.C. Over the next three years, it continued to boom and it is now a professional membership organization with over 500 members in six different cities: D.C., New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles and San Francisco. </span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson also made huge headway when she kicked off <a href=\"http://www.colorcommconference.com/events/c2-leading-the-way/event-summary-deb4a8f8c05c44828d6ba66a78795552.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">ColorComm&rsquo;s first annual conference in August 2014.</a></span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The conference was driven by people in cities where ColorComm did not exist,\" Wilson said. \"We really realized that we could connect women throughout the country and we don't necessarily have to have ColorComm chapter in their city to have the ColorComm experience.\"</span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson was right -- women from all over traveled to Miami, Florida, to attend the inaugural conference and engage in the experiences it offered. Standout journalists like Soledad O'Brien spoke to the crowd and reporter Lisa Ling attended the following year. The Huffington Post's very own Arianna Huffington will deliver the keynote address at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.colorcommconference.com/events/c2-leading-the-way/event-summary-deb4a8f8c05c44828d6ba66a78795552.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">this year's conference</a>.</span></p><br />\n<br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within five years, Wilson has managed to launch and build a successful network of women who work together to help uplift, congratulate and inspire others through their work.

State universities poured over&nbsp;$10.3 billion in mandatory student fees and other subsidies into sports teams from 2010 through 2014.</p><br />\n<p>The HuffPost/Chronicle report showed that about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/projects/ncaa/subsidy-scorecards/georgia-state-university\">84 percent</a> of Georgia State University's athletics budget was subsidized by student fees and other institutional support. That was <a href=\"http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/ncaa/sports-at-any-cost\" target=\"_blank\">the 14th highest percentage</a>&nbsp;in the nation.</p><br />\n<p>While Georgia State's in-state tuition and fees are about average, the majority of its students are eligible for Pell grants, meaning they come from lower-income backgrounds and find it harder to shoulder added college costs.</p><br />\n<p>Under the new cap, student fees at Georgia's public colleges and universities cannot account for more than 65 to 85 percent of the individual school's athletics budget.

Drones also make business services, like delivering packages, more efficient, according to the PwC report. That means drones can cut down on costs without necessarily ousting tons of workers.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>And while some industries stand to lose lots of jobs to automation, others probably won't be as severely affected.&nbsp;Much of the agricultural sector is <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-employment/\" target=\"_blank\">already mechanized</a>, for instance, and drones used to inventory crops might just replace&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-monsanto-m-a-bayer-idUSKCN0Y31IJ\" target=\"_blank\">satellites currently used</a>&nbsp;for the same purpose.</p><br />\n<p>\"As with any emerging technology, some types of jobs currently done by people will be less required in the future, especially those that are highly repetitive or dangerous,\" Michal Mazur, one of the study's authors, told The Huffington Post. \"But at the same time, we see a need for a growing number of new professions,\" including drone designers and data analysts, he said.</p><br />\n<div id=\"client-ui\" class=\"container-fluid sidebar_theme_ocean_theme\">&nbsp;</div><br />\n<br />\n<p>That doesn't mean drones won't replace any jobs, however.&nbsp;Some tasks -- like collecting data about infrastructure or quickly delivering medical supplies -- can be done more efficiently using drones, the report notes. Drones can also make it easier to capture aerial footage for films,&nbsp;survey land and plan mining projects.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Overall, there's little question that automation is going to dramatically change the way people work over the next few decades.</p><br />\n<p>Nearly half of the activities people get paid to do could be automated right now using existing technology, according to a report from consulting firm <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/business-technology/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey</a>. It's not just low-wage jobs that could vanish. While jobs that pay less than $20 an hour are most at risk of disappearing, even highly paid jobs involve activities that could be automated, the report found.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>But the McKinsey report stresses that automating certain tasks isn&rsquo;t the same as replacing entire occupations.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;Very few occupations will be automated in their entirety in the near or medium term,&rdquo; the report states. &ldquo;Rather, certain&nbsp;<em>activities&nbsp;</em>are more likely to be automated.&rdquo;</p><br />\n<p>And even when robots take old jobs, they often create new ones, according to J.P Gownder, an analyst at the tech research firm Forrester. For instance, robots require people to repair and maintain them, jobs that often take significant skill and training.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;While these technologies are both real and important, and some jobs will disappear because of them, the future of jobs overall isn&rsquo;t nearly as gloomy as many prognosticators believe,&rdquo; Gownder wrote in a 2015&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.forrester.com/jp_gownder/15-08-24-robots_wont_steal_all_the_jobs_but_theyll_transform_the_way_we_work\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>. &ldquo;In reality, automation will spur the growth of many new jobs&mdash;including some entirely new job categories.&rdquo;</p><br />\n<p>Automation is definitely going to shake things up. But there's little use worrying until we know exactly how.&nbsp;</p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/5734b330160000b60731e92a.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/walmart-rolls-out-cheaper-2-day-shipping-amazon_n_9937192.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Walmart Rolls Out Cheaper 2-Day Shipping In Bid Against Amazon]]></title>\n      <author>Jenny Che</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/walmart-rolls-out-cheaper-2-day-shipping-amazon_n_9937192.html?utm_hp_ref=business&amp;ir=Business</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:53:12 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<br />\n<p>Wal-Mart Stores &lt;WMT.N&gt; said Thursday it was shortening the delivery time for an unlimited<span class=\"highlight\"> shipping </span>program it is testing to two days from three as it taps a network of recently built warehouses for packaging online orders.</p><br />\n<p>The retailer also said it was lowering the annual fee for the<span class=\"highlight\"> shipping </span>program by $1 to $49.

After all, what's so bad about people assuming you'll be successful?</p><br />\n<p>A lot of things, it turns out.</p><br />\n<p>The myth erases Asian histories of oppression and flattens diverse Asian groups into one identity, among&nbsp;<a href=\"http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/04/dismantle-model-minority-myth/\" target=\"_blank\">many other outcomes</a>. It also ignores the Asian-American groups who have some of the highest <a href=\"https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AAPI-Education.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">dropout rates</a>&nbsp;nationwide and are more likely to live in poverty and need language assistance.</p><br />\n<p>So it's remarkable that no less than the White House has taken it upon itself to dispel the model minority myth for good. Last week, the Department of Education announced a \"AAPI Data Disaggregation Initiative\" to determine the real academic struggles of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students in public school.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secretary of Education John King announced the initiative in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2q1NxEf_5A\" target=\"_blank\">video message</a>&nbsp;last Wednesday.&nbsp;The Initiative will give states $1 million in grants to collect accurate data on AAPI student performance. The announcement coincides with <a href=\"http://asianpacificheritage.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">AAPI Heritage Month</a>, which is in May.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"There is an urgent need to address the daily challenges that AAPI's face, which are also as diverse as their communities,\" Kind said in the video.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">King specifically called out the model minority myth, which he described as&nbsp;\"the notion that all AAPI's have access to a quality education and are affluent, which has prevented AAPI communities from fully benefiting from federal programs and resources that can support vulnerable and underserved people.\"</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although AAPI fall under a single census category, \"Asian,\" they are comprised of <a href=\"http://www.nais.org/Magazines-Newsletters/ISMagazine/Pages/The-Model-Minority-Myth.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">over 50</a> ethnic groups. Immigrants from India, China, and Korea, who largely came to America after the <a href=\"http://www.asian-nation.org/1965-immigration-act.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">1965 Immigration Act</a>, tend to have professional degrees and white-collar occupations -- because those were the only kinds of people who were granted visas. Considering the fact that just China and India have a population of over 2 billion, it's easy to see how their diaspora in the U.S. may be unrepresentative, socioeconomically.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Plus, many smaller Asian groups, like the Vietnamese, Laotian, Hmong, and Tongans, tend to fall on the other end of the \"achievement\" spectrum. These students have some of the highest <a href=\"https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AAPI-Education.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">dropout rates</a> in America and are more likely to need economic assistance. But since they fall under the umbrella of the \"model AAPI,\" they are much less likely to get the help they need.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">King called this an \"opportunity gap\" within AAPI populations. He stressed the importance of getting data on \"subpopulations,\" or distinct ethnic groups within the broad AAPI designation.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"AAPI have been talking about the dangers of the model minority myth for years... but it too often been an echo chamber within our own community,\" Karin Wang, of the advocacy group Asian-Americans Advancing Justice, told HuffPost.&nbsp;\"It is a game changer to have the White House take such a strong stand against the 'model minority' idea.\"</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The idea to get better data on AAPI students is not new. In July 2015,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hirono.senate.gov/press-releases/hirono-and-heller-champion-all-students-count-amendment\" target=\"_blank\">Hawaii Sen. Mazi Hirono</a>&nbsp;called on all school districts with more than 1000 AAPI students to report data on ethnic subgroups. In October 2015, California Gov. Brown <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/docs/AB_176_Veto_Message.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">vetoed a bill</a> that would require the state's public universities to disaggregate AAPI student data. While both those measures&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/08/05/who-the-model-minority-stereotype-hurts-most.html\" target=\"_blank\">failed</a>, the new grant-making initiative, less than a year later, seems like a big step forward.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The program is part of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, which President Obama <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/aapi/about\" target=\"_blank\">reestablished in 2009</a>.&nbsp;According to a <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/programs/d2/application.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">program brief</a>&nbsp;on the DoE website, the grants range from $100,000 to $400,000, so there will likely be between three and ten schools participating in the initiative.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Public schools are a great place to start tackling the model minority myth, said Wang, because \"education is a unifying issue for many AAPIs.\" She added,&nbsp;\"if we work collectively, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders could chart a new course in reforming our nation's educational system and helping to close achievement gaps.\"</p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/57348c7b2200004207256672.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/facebook-trending-topics_n_9935644.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[More Bad News For Facebook]]></title>\n      <author>Damon Beres</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/facebook-trending-topics_n_9935644.html?utm_hp_ref=business&amp;ir=Business</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:20:41 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<br />\n<p>Another day, another controversy for Facebook.</p><br />\n<p>A new report published by the Guardian Thursday states in no uncertain terms that the social network relies on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-trending-news-leaked-documents-editor-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">\"human intervention at almost every stage of its news operation.\"</a>&nbsp;The paper published a 21-page leaked Facebook document showing guidelines for the social network's news editors that include information about how they can \"inject\" stories into the site's Trending Topics module under certain circumstances.

(See UPDATE below for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's pledge to investigate.)</p><br />\n<p>The news that humans are crafting the feature is controversial for a couple of reasons.&nbsp;First, Facebook doesn't mention anything about human involvement in its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/737806312958641\" target=\"_blank\">description of Trending Topics</a>.&nbsp;On its help page about the section of the site, the company states: \"<a class=\"_5dwo\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1401671260054622\">Trending</a> shows you topics that have recently become popular on Facebook.\"&nbsp;</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Second, and more damning, Facebook Vice President <a href=\"We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Stocky said in a statement</a> earlier this week that \"We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so.\"</p><br />\n<p>The documents published by the Guardian include details about how Facebook's editors can do exactly that, as long as the topic is \"appearing in the demo tool.\" It's not clear what that tool is.</p><br />\n<p>As the Guardian notes, Stocky's wording is a little vague -- no one really knows what \"artificially\" means in this case. The Guardian reported that three former editors said \"they had indeed inserted stories that were not visible to users into the trending feed in order to make the experience more topical.\"</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>It's logical that Facebook should have human curators. Without trained news editors guiding the tool, the social network's Trending Topics would likely be a swamp of Internet junk 24/7.</p><br />\n<p>The problem is that the company hasn't been forthcoming about how its news operation works. Publications typically have <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/static/about-us\" target=\"_blank\">mastheads&nbsp;</a>detailing who holds any given job. Media outlets are accountable for the information they publish.</p><br />\n<p>Facebook, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-trending-news-curators_us_5730c2c8e4b096e9f092103c\" target=\"_blank\">as The Huffington Post learned earlier this week</a>, forces its news editors to sign strict nondisclosure agreements and doesn't publicly list them. It's not really accountable for news you see on its platform, because the articles or videos you see on Facebook are created by other media organizations; the social network's news editors just put headlines on stories they read elsewhere.</p><br />\n<p>To be clear: This doesn't mean that news isn't naturally shared and distributed on Facebook. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-news-facebook_us_57321975e4b096e9f092d63b\" target=\"_blank\">Data published by HuffPost earlier this week</a>&nbsp;suggests that news from conservative outlets is widely shared in Facebook's News Feed, for example, even though Gizmodo reported that Facebook's <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006?utm_medium=sharefromsite&amp;utm_source=Gizmodo_twitter\" target=\"_blank\">news editors said they suppressed conservative news</a>&nbsp;from inclusion in Trending Topics.</p><br />\n<p>But Trending Topics remain an important part of Facebook's brand. They suggest the company is shaping the conversation. Writers across media brands look to those topics for ideas about what they should cover.</p><br />\n<p>Like any respectable news organization, Facebook could be transparent about who's behind the content published on its site. But, so far, it's not.</p><br />\n<p><em>\ufeff</em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 9:33 p.m. --&nbsp;CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102830259184701\" target=\"_blank\">issued a statement</a>:</p><br />\n<blockquote><br />\n<p>There was a report suggesting that Facebook contractors working on Trending Topics suppressed stories with conservative viewpoints. We take this report very seriously and are conducting a full investigation to ensure our teams upheld the integrity of this product. We have found no evidence that this report is true. If we find anything against our principles, you have my commitment that we will take additional steps to address it. In the coming weeks, I'll also be inviting leading conservatives and people from across the political spectrum to talk with me about this and share their points of view.</p><br />\n</blockquote> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/5734bb73130000f0043816b9.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/hillary-clinton-progressive-fed-reforms_n_9935562.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton Embraces Progressive Federal Reserve Reforms]]></title>\n      <author>Daniel Marans</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/05/12/hillary-clinton-progressive-fed-reforms_n_9935562.html?utm_hp_ref=business&amp;ir=Business</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:09:42 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<br />\n<p>Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton came out in favor of changes to the Federal Reserve that would reduce the number of bankers in key central bank positions on Thursday, marking a major coup for national progressive groups championing reform.</p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The Federal Reserve is a vital institution for our economy and the wellbeing of our middle class, and the American people should have no doubt that the Fed is serving the public interest,&rdquo; Jesse Ferguson, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said in a statement. &ldquo;That's why Secretary Clinton believes that the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole as well as that commonsense reforms -- like getting bankers off the boards of regional Federal Reserve banks -- are long overdue.&rdquo;</span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign also provided insight into the type of Federal Reserve governors that Clinton would appoint.</span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Secretary Clinton will also defend the Fed's so-called dual mandate -- the legal requirement that it focus on full employment as well as inflation -- and will appoint Fed governors who share this commitment and who will carry out unwavering oversight of the financial industry,&rdquo; Ferguson said.</span></p><br />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The announcement brings the Democratic presidential front-runner closer to the position of her rival, Sen.

In addition to ceaseless calls to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, Republicans and allied conservative activists continued to attempt upending the law <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/25/obamacare-lawsuits_n_7665702.html\" target=\"_blank\">in the courts</a>.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ruling in House v. Burwell, which won't go into immediate effect pending appeal, would have a devastating effect on the poorest Obamacare enrollees who receive financial assistance to limit their out-of-pocket health care costs.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The key argument in the lawsuit then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/21/gop-lawsuit-obamacare_n_6198938.html\" target=\"_blank\">brought in 2014</a> is that the Obama administration unconstitutionally spent money on these so-called cost-sharing reductions because Congress didn't appropriate the funds. The administration counters that the funding is permanent and doesn't require legislative authorization.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, who sits in Washington, agreed with the House GOP in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2014cv1967-73\" target=\"_blank\">the latest ruling</a>.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At his daily briefing <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_833510042\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Thursday</span></span>, White House press secretary Josh Earnest seemed confident that the administration is on solid legal footing in the case.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's unfortunate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to re-fight a political fight that they keep losing,\" he said, as he deferred to the Justice Department on the administration's next steps. \"They've been losing this fight for six years. And they'll lose it again.\"</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The subsidies at stake <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/17/obamacare-cost-sharing-provisions-and-the-stakes-in-house-v-burwell/\" target=\"_blank\">reduce out-of-pocket costs</a> like deductibles and copayments for people who earn up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $29,500 for a single person.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under the ACA, health insurance companies must lower these costs for customers who qualify because of their low incomes, and the federal government pays the insurers to cover the expenses.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Residents of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/marketplace-in-your-state/\" target=\"_blank\">38 states</a>&nbsp;can use the federal <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">HealthCare.gov</a> platform to shop for insurance, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/addendum-health-insurance-marketplaces-2016-open-enrollment-period-final-enrollment-report\" target=\"_blank\">59 percent</a> of 9.6 million customers received this type of assistance at the end of this year's enrollment period.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Without the <a href=\"https://www.healthpocket.com/obamacare/cost-sharing-reduction-silver-plan\" target=\"_blank\">cost-sharing reductions</a>, low-wage workers would be left with health insurance requiring them to pay large portions of their incomes before their benefits kicked in.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That would make the insurance itself significantly less valuable, even with heavily subsidized premiums, which could cause beneficiaries to drop out of the market.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The lawsuit doesn't challenge the tax credits that reduce enrollees' monthly health insurance premiums, which are available to people with incomes up to four times the federal poverty level.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In her decision, Collyer wrote that the administration must wait for Congress to act before it can provide any further payments to insurance companies covering low-income Obamacare enrollees under the challenged provisions.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Affordable Care Act unambiguously appropriates money for...premium tax credits but not for...reimbursements to insurers,\" Collyer wrote. \"Such an appropriation cannot be inferred.\"</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her decision frequently references <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/26/obamacare-supreme-court-case_n_7309064.html\" target=\"_blank\">King v. Burwell</a>, the most recent unsuccessful Supreme Court challenge to the Affordable Care Act.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yet Collyer stayed her order to halt the cost-sharing payments, meaning the spending can continue while the appeals process runs its course.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) cheered the decision in a <a href=\"http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/big-win-constitution\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is an historic win for the Constitution and the American people,\" he said. \"The court ruled that the administration overreached by spending taxpayer money without approval from the people's representatives. Here, the executive branch is being held accountable to We the People, and that's why this decision is very good news.\"</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is an early stage for the litigation, although the case should be expected to make its way to the Supreme Court, probably well after the presidential election.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But before that, the administration likely will fiercely appeal Collyer's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit -- the same court where Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland sits -- and focus on the question of whether the House has \"standing\" to even bring the lawsuit in the first place.&nbsp;Collyer granted the House institutional standing in a ruling made last year, marking the <a href=\"http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/oh-boy-here-we-go-again/\" target=\"_blank\">first time</a> the legislative branch as a whole was allowed to sue the executive branch over an appropriations dispute. If the appeals court overrules Collyer's opinion on standing, then the case would be dismissed, after which the plaintiffs probably would appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But the uncertainty of the high court's current makeup, evenly divided between conservative and liberal justices, makes it hard to predict if the justices will even choose to get involved in the dispute. Since the battle is at its core political, the court may very well let the elected officials battle it out.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the House ultimately prevails in the courts, that <a href=\"http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/what-happens-if-the-house-wins-its-aca-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">might not actually kill&nbsp;</a>the cost-sharing subsidies, however, and could lead to protracted legal fights between health insurance companies and the U.S. government.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the Collyer ruled cost-sharing money must be appropriated, the plaintiffs didn't challenge the part of the statute requiring health insurance companies to reduce cost-sharing for their lowest-income exchange customers.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The cost-sharing reduction money goes directly to health insurance companies that cover eligible enrollees. Consequently, those companies could argue in court that they are entitled to the funds, and the federal government would be forced to pay them -- even without a congressional appropriation of the money -- if those arguments persuade judges.</p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.</em></p><br />\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article has been updated throughout.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/5734df2e2200004207256758.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
