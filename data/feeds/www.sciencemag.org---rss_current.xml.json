commit to putting each and every person's safety, dignity, freedom, and right to thrive at the heart of decision-making. More than 125 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, a level of suffering not seen since World War II. The social problems are wide and deep, from war and human trafficking to the gross inequality between the wealthy 1% and the poorest 3 billion of the population. Included in the summit's Agenda for Humanity are climate and natural disasters. Indeed, 1 year ago, Pope Francis emphasized, in the encyclical Laudato Si, that complex crises have both social and environmental dimensions. The bond between humans and the natural world means that we live in an \u00e2\u0080\u009cintegral ecology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and as such, an integrated approach to environmental and social justice is required.\nAuthors: Marcelo S\u00c3\u00a1nchez Sorondo, Veerabhadran Ramanathan]]></description>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.aag0826</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/748?rss=1\">\n<title>[In Brief] News at a glance</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/748?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<description><![CDATA[In science news around the world, Louisiana's New Iberia Research Center announces it plans to release all 220 of its chimpanzees to a sanctuary, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will regulate e-cigarettes, the Cayman Islands prepare to release genetically modified mosquitoes to combat the Zika virus, the United Kingdom's new polar research ship has an official name\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it isn't Boaty McBoatface\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Mercury's transit across the sun draws audiences to observatories around the world.

Five research cruises this spring and summer will fetch data from the 53 moorings in an array called Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP), which stretches from Labrador to Greenland to Scotland. The array's measurements of temperature, salinity, and current velocity will be key to understanding the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and how it is affected by climate change. The AMOC currents include the Gulf Stream, which brings shallow warm waters north, nourishing fisheries and warming northwest Europe. The warm waters give up their heat in the bitterly cold regions monitored by OSNAP, become denser, and sink, forming ocean-bottom currents that return southward, hugging the perimeter of the ocean basins. Models suggest that climate change should weaken the AMOC as warmer Arctic temperatures, combined with buoyant freshwater from Greenland's melting ice cap, impede the formation of deep currents. But so far, limited ocean measurements show the AMOC to be far more capricious than the models have been able to capture.\nAuthor: Eric Hand]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Oceanography</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.352.6287.751</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/752?rss=1\">\n<title>[In Depth] Animals show how Zika harms fetuses</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/752?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Jon Cohen</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[Zika virus has frightened people the world over because of growing evidence that it can have severe effects on fetuses when it infects pregnant women. Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month declared that there was a \"causal relationship\" between the virus and harm to baby brains\u00e2\u0080\u0094most notably, small heads called microcephaly\u00e2\u0080\u0094many questions remain about how the damage happens from what was long considered a harmless virus. Three new papers published online this week describe different mouse models that infected pregnant dams with the virus, or, in one case, placed viral injections directly into the fetal brain. The studies all confirm that Zika virus harms the growth of the fetus, examining how the virus damages both placental cells and critical neural cells in the fetal brain. Two of the studies demonstrate, for the first time in an animal model, that Zika virus can cause microcephaly. Studies are also underway with Zika virus in pregnant monkeys, a model that much more closely resembles human pregnancy, and the community of primate researchers is going to unusual lengths to share their data openly in near real time.\nAuthor: Jon Cohen]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Infectious Disease</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.352.6287.752</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/754?rss=1\">\n<title>[In Depth] Unexpected revelations for study volunteer</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/754?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Jennifer Couzin-Frankel</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[About 5 years ago, psychologist Rita Woidislawsky joined a research study studying people with naturally elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol.\u00c2\u00a0Like millions of volunteers who give blood and a few hours of their time to scientists, the project had barely registered on her radar recently. And then last month came a startling discovery. After a chance encounter with the lead scientist, she learned that the research group had published a paper in Science in which her case figured prominently (although only her age at the time of most data collection was listed). The news alarmed her: Researchers suspected that rather than being beneficial, the high HDL Woidislawsky had always been proud of might be deleterious. She had known nothing about the publication plans or her own results. The experience places Woidislawsky at the nexus of two distinct quandaries in clinical research: What health information do researchers owe the volunteers in their studies, especially when it's not clear what it means? And should researchers notify volunteers of publications in which their story appears, even if it's impossible for others to identify them?\nAuthor: Jennifer Couzin-Frankel]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Clinical Trials</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.352.6287.754</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/755?rss=1\">\n<title>[In Depth] NSF director unveils big ideas</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/755?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Jeffrey Mervis</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[France C\u00c3\u00b3rdova, the director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Arlington, Virginia, has unveiled a research agenda intended to both shape the agency's next few decades and win over the next U.S. president and Congress. The nine \"big ideas\" she presented last week to the National Science Board are meant to illustrate how increased support for the type of basic research that NSF funds can help answer pressing societal problems. They range from how humans interact with technology to how climate change in the polar regions will impact the global economy, environment, and culture. C\u00c3\u00b3rdova admits that it's unusual for a federal agency to talk publicly about its long-range budget plans. But she is betting that touting the agency's capabilities during an election year will pay dividends after voters have chosen a successor to President Barack Obama.\nAuthor: Jeffrey Mervis]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Science Policy</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.352.6287.755</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/756?rss=1\">\n<title>[In Depth] How the Venus flytrap acquired its taste for meat</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/756?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Erik Stokstad</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[Carnivorous plants have remarkable adaptations to catch and digest invertebrates. These aggressive feeding habits allow the plants to survive in poor soil by giving them a new source of nitrogen and other nutrients. Many biologists suspect ancestors of carnivorous plants evolved by adapting mechanisms normally used to detect and defend against herbivores. Now, this hypothesis has gained support from a detailed genetic study of Venus flytraps (Dionaea muscipula). Patterns of gene expression confirmed that the flytrap and a noncarnivorous plant use the same signaling pathway to detect insects. Experiments showed that the flytrap digests its prey with the same kind digestive enzymes that other plants use to ward off insects. A few hours after catching prey, the flytrap turns on another set of familiar genes to absorb nutrients; many of these genes are expressed in the roots of other plants.\nAuthor: Erik Stokstad]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Plant Science</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.352.6287.756</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/758?rss=1\">\n<title>[Feature] Resistance fighters</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/758?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Kai Kupferschmidt</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[Evolutionary biologists have begun studying the rise of antibiotic resistance, one of the most urgent problems in public health. Their work suggests that old dogmas about the best way to prevent resistance may be wrong. Contrary to what most doctors think, for instance, using high doses of antibiotics may sometimes help spread resistance rather than prevent it. Combining antibiotics could backfire as well, and long treatments may sometimes do more harm than good. However, many researchers and clinicians are skeptical about these new ideas, which are difficult to test in humans because it might involve giving some patients a suboptimal dose of a life-saving drug.\nAuthor: Kai Kupferschmidt]]></description>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.352.6287.758</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/762?rss=1\">\n<title>[Feature] Museum drawers go digital</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/762?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Nala Rogers</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[No one knows exactly how many natural history specimens exist in museums and other research institutions worldwide, but some calculate it's on the order of 3 billion. In most cases, the displays seen by visitors make up a tiny slice of this treasure; museum curators estimate that more than 99% is stored away from the public gaze. Researchers have for decades used museum specimens to answer questions about how species diverge, where they move around the globe, and how they respond to changing conditions. But they have traditionally had to travel from museum to museum in person, or else request that the specimens be mailed to them. Now, even as museums struggle with funding woes that limit their activities, many around the world are working to put specimen photographs and related data online where anyone can view them. Until recently, these efforts were slow and painstaking, barely chipping away at the staggering amount of data in collections. Now, technological advances and innovative workflows are allowing institutions to think bigger, ushering in a new age of mass digitization. A new conveyor belt system at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., will allow the digitization of 650,000 specimens within the period of a year, each one costing just $1. As digitization grows faster and cheaper, more governments and institutions are investing in it. Since 2011, the U.S. National Science Foundation has devoted $10 million per year to digitization efforts in nonfederal collections across the United States. But even with these new funding opportunities, museum officials and curators stress that there is still far too little money to make all specimens digital.\nAuthor: Nala Rogers]]></description>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.352.6287.762</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/766?rss=1\">\n<title>[Perspective] Reconciliation in Sierra Leone</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/766?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Katherine Casey</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[Since the end of World War II, there have been 259 armed conflicts in 159 locations (1).

Dahl</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[The chemical composition of Earth's mantle can tell us how our planet formed and how subsequent mantle dynamics have since homogenized the mantle through convective processes. Most terrestrial rocks have a similar tungsten (W) isotope composition (1), but some rocks that have been dated at 2.8 Ga (billion years old) (2), 3.8 Ga (3), and 3.96 Ga (4) have elevated 182W/184W ratios. This is reported as \u00c2\u00b5182W, in parts per million (ppm) deviation from the bulk silicate Earth. Until now, the outliers have included only these ancient rock samples with a small \u00c2\u00b5182W excess (\u00e2\u0089\u00a415 ppm) that can be attributed to the final \u00e2\u0088\u00bc0.5% of Earth's mass that accreted late in its accretion history. On page 809 of this issue, Rizo et al. (5) report W isotope data from young mantle-derived rocks with \u00c2\u00b5182W excesses of 10 to 48 ppm. This result is spectacular because the range of \u00c2\u00b5182W values in mantle-derived rocks is larger than can be accommodated by late accretion; the implication is that remnants of Earth's earliest mantle have been preserved over the entirety of Earth's history.\nAuthor: Tais W.

Current studies in molecular evolution are almost entirely retrospective, with a focus on the mutations that were fixed during evolution, and the conclusions are often explanatory, offering no predictive insights. Because only a tiny fraction of all mutations that have ever occurred during evolution have been fixed, the \u00e2\u0080\u009csuccesses\u00e2\u0080\u009d that we see today provide an incomplete or even biased understanding of the evolutionary process. One way to circumvent this problem is to obtain the whole fitness landscape of a gene to understand, prospectively, chance and necessity in evolution (see the figure). Two studies in this issue, by Li et al. on page 837 (1) and Puchta et al. on page 840 (2), each take on this challenge by characterizing the in vivo fitness landscape of two RNA genes.\nAuthors: Xionglei He, Li Liu]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Evolution</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.aaf7543</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/770?rss=1\">\n<title>[Perspective] REMembering what you learned</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/770?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Bernat Kocsis</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[Which memories are retained, where, and in what form depends on a long afterlife of the acquired information in the brain. Initial steps of consolidation may be completed within a few hours during wakefulness, but other forms of postacquisition processing take longer, extending into sleep (1, 2). The relationship between brain activity during sleep and memory consolidation remains controversial and poorly understood. On page 812 of this issue, Boyce et al. (3) demonstrate that a distinct form of hippocampal neural activity, called theta oscillation, is critical for memory formation during the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep.\nAuthor: Bernat Kocsis]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Neuroscience</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.aaf9117</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/772?rss=1\">\n<title>[Perspective] Refugee protection and resettlement problems</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/772?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Elizabeth Cullen Dunn</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[In 2015, more than a million refugees and other migrants entered the European Union. They are just a small part of the world's rapidly burgeoning population of displaced people, which climbed by more than 37% between 2009 and 2015 to reach 59.5 million people. Humanitarian aid to these people has been dramatically insufficient, and many displaced people now lack adequate food, medical care, housing, or transportation. As a geographer, I spent 16 months between 2009 and 2013 conducting participant observation research in camps for displaced people in Georgia (see the photo), where I discovered serious shortfalls in the humanitarian aid system. Increasingly, humanitarian aid is a temporary solution to a permanent problem, a stopgap that not only does not help displaced people resettle but, instead, makes it more difficult for them to move on with their lives.\nAuthor: Elizabeth Cullen Dunn]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Essay</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.aaf8962</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/774?rss=1\">\n<title>[Perspective] Nanophotonics gets twisted</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/774?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Gabriel Molina-Terriza</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[Nanophotonics investigates the processing of light at the nanoscale, with the promise of transforming the telecommunication, biomedical, and computation industries. Advances in nanophotonics have traditionally been boosted but also limited by our capabilities of fabricating complex structures at the nanoscale. On page 805 of this issue, Ren et al. (1) try to break free of these limitations with their experimental demonstration of a simple nanostructure that can separate and process complex light modes carrying angular momentum. Thus, instead of processing light fields with complex nanostructures, the idea is to use comparatively simpler structures and push the complexity to the light fields themselves.\nAuthor: Gabriel Molina-Terriza]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Applied Physics</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.aaf6388</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/775?rss=1\">\n<title>[Perspective] Living sentinels for climate change effects</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/775?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Martin Wikelski</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[Humans have long used animals as sentinels for threats to their own well-being. Canaries in coal mines are a classic example. On a global scale, studies of birds were key to detecting environmental problems caused by the excessive use of pesticides (1, 2). The recent loss of up to 98% of some vulture populations highlights the widespread dangerous effects of diclofenac use in cattle (3). Bee populations, sentinels for global insect losses, are also declining owing to the combined stress from pesticides and other environmental changes caused by humans, resulting in a widespread loss of pollination services (4). On page 819 of this issue, van Gils et al. (5) highlight another global ecological warning sign, this time linked to Arctic warming. They show that long-term changes in the body architecture of Arctic wading birds can affect their survival in their tropical wintering range.\nAuthors: Martin Wikelski, Grigori Tertitski]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Ecology</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.aaf6544</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/776?rss=1\">\n<title>[Policy Forum] Confronting stem cell hype</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/776?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Timothy Caulfield</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[The way science is represented to the public can influence understanding and expectations, frame policy debates, and affect the implementation and use of emerging technologies. Inaccurate representations of research may, for example, lead to public confusion about the readiness of a technology for clinical application. As a result, the issue of science \u00e2\u0080\u009chype\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which the state of scientific progress, the degree of certainty in models or bench results, or the potential applications of research are exaggerated\u00e2\u0080\u0094is receiving increased attention from the popular press, the research community, and scientific societies (1). In newly issued guidelines on the ethical conduct of human pluripotent stem cell research and clinical translation (2), the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) explicitly recognizes and confronts the issue of science hype. By placing a clear obligation on researchers, the ISSCR hopes to make balance in public representations of research a norm associated with scientific integrity. The focus on public communication, which is new to this version of the guidelines, is the result of both specific concerns regarding how stem cell research has been portrayed in the public sphere and the growing recognition that researchers play an important role in the science communication process.\nAuthors: Timothy Caulfield, Douglas Sipp, Charles E.

Too often, however, the field is looked upon as a set of arcane procedures that are implemented, without much thought, by computer algorithms. Such a myopic view of this most modern of the sciences deprives the viewer of the accumulated product of a great deal of beautiful and subtle thinking. Statistician Stephen Stigler's new book, The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom, sets out to remedy this. Each of the seven pillars that Stigler, in his wisdom, has hewn from the past two centuries of statistical thought provides surprising insights.\nAuthor: Howard Wainer]]></description>\n<dc:subject>Data Analysis</dc:subject>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.aaf9115</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/780.1?rss=1\">\n<title>[Letter] Reminder to deposit DNA sequences</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/780.1?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Mark Blaxter</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[Authors: Mark Blaxter, Antoine Danchin, Babis Savakis, Kaoru Fukami-Kobayashi, Ken Kurokawa, Sumio Sugano, Richard J.

However, the cellular interactions necessary for IgA class switching are poorly defined. Here we show that in mice, activated B cells use the chemokine receptor CCR6 to access the subepithelial dome (SED) of PPs. There, B cells undergo prolonged interactions with SED dendritic cells (DCs). PP IgA class switching requires innate lymphoid cells, which promote lymphotoxin-\u00ce\u00b2 receptor (LT\u00ce\u00b2R)\u00e2\u0080\u0093dependent maintenance of DCs. PP DCs augment IgA production by integrin \u00ce\u00b1v\u00ce\u00b28-mediated activation of transforming growth factor\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00ce\u00b2 (TGF\u00ce\u00b2). In mice where B cells cannot access the SED, IgA responses against oral antigen and gut commensals are impaired. These studies establish the PP SED as a niche supporting DC\u00e2\u0080\u0093B cell interactions needed for TGF\u00ce\u00b2 activation and induction of mucosal IgA responses.\nAuthors: Andrea Reboldi, Tal I.

To restore social cohesion, many countries undertake truth and reconciliation efforts. We examined the consequences of one such effort in Sierra Leone, designed and implemented by a Sierra Leonean nongovernmental organization called Fambul Tok. As a part of this effort, community-level forums are set up in which victims detail war atrocities, and perpetrators confess to war crimes. We used random assignment to study its impact across 200 villages, drawing on data from 2383 individuals. We found that reconciliation had both positive and negative consequences. It led to greater forgiveness of perpetrators and strengthened social capital: Social networks were larger, and people contributed more to public goods in treated villages. However, these benefits came at a substantial cost: The reconciliation treatment also worsened psychological health, increasing depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder in these same villages. For a subset of villages, we measured outcomes both 9 months and 31 months after the intervention. These results show that the effects, both positive and negative, persisted into the longer time horizon. Our findings suggest that policy-makers need to restructure reconciliation processes in ways that reduce their negative psychological costs while retaining their positive societal benefits.\nAuthors: Jacobus Cilliers, Oeindrila Dube, Bilal Siddiqi]]></description>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.aad9682</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/795?rss=1\">\n<title>[Report] Large optical nonlinearity of indium tin oxide in its epsilon-near-zero region</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/795?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>M.

We observe a change in the real part of the refractive index of 0.72 \u00c2\u00b1 0.025, corresponding to 170% of the linear refractive index.

We demonstrate noninterference angular momentum multiplexing by using a mode-sorting nanoring aperture with a chip-scale footprint as small as 4.2 micrometers by 4.2 micrometers, where nanoring slits exhibit a distinctive outcoupling efficiency on tightly confined plasmonic modes. The nonresonant mode-sorting sensitivity and scalability of our approach enable on-chip parallel multiplexing over a bandwidth of 150 nanometers in the visible wavelength range.

Here we present evidence for a case of such body shrinkage, potentially due to malnutrition in early life. We show that an avian long-distance migrant (red knot, Calidris canutus canutus), which is experiencing globally unrivaled warming rates at its high-Arctic breeding grounds, produces smaller offspring with shorter bills during summers with early snowmelt. This has consequences half a world away at their tropical wintering grounds, where shorter-billed individuals have reduced survival rates. This is associated with these molluscivores eating fewer deeply buried bivalve prey and more shallowly buried seagrass rhizomes. We suggest that seasonal migrants can experience reduced fitness at one end of their range as a result of a changing climate at the other end.\nAuthors: Jan A. van Gils, Simeon Lisovski, Tamar Lok, W\u00c5\u0082odzimierz Meissner, Agnieszka O\u00c5\u00bcarowska, Jimmy de Fouw, Eldar Rakhimberdiev, Mikhail Y.

After removing potential confounding effects of daily persistence, and seasonal and interannual variability in precipitation, we find that soil moisture anomalies significantly influence rainfall probabilities over 38% of the area with a median factor of 13%.

We report that the condensation of formamidopyrimidines (FaPys) with sugars provides the natural N-9 nucleosides with extreme regioselectivity and in good yields (60%). The FaPys are available from formic acid and aminopyrimidines, which are in turn available from prebiotic molecules that were also detected during the Rosetta comet mission. This nucleoside formation pathway can be fused to sugar-forming reactions to produce pentosides, providing a plausible scenario of how purine nucleosides may have formed under prebiotic conditions.\nAuthors: Sidney Becker, Ines Thoma, Amrei Deutsch, Tim Gehrke, Peter Mayer, Hendrik Zipse, Thomas Carell]]></description>\n<dc:identifier>10.1126/science.aad2808</dc:identifier>\n</item>\n<item rdf:about=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/837?rss=1\">\n<title>[Report] The fitness landscape of a tRNA gene</title>\n<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/837?rss=1</link>\n<dc:date>2016-05-13</dc:date>\n<dc:creator>Chuan Li</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[Fitness landscapes describe the genotype-fitness relationship and represent major determinants of evolutionary trajectories.

Many mutations had small individual effects but had large effects in the context of additional mutations, which indicated negative epistasis.

H3K36M mutant nucleosomes inhibit the enzymatic activities of several H3K36 methyltransferases. Depleting H3K36 methyltransferases, or expressing an H3K36I mutant that similarly inhibits H3K36 methylation, is sufficient to phenocopy the H3K36M mutation. After the loss of H3K36 methylation, a genome-wide gain in H3K27 methylation leads to a redistribution of polycomb repressive complex 1 and de-repression of its target genes known to block mesenchymal differentiation. Our findings are mirrored in human undifferentiated sarcomas in which novel K36M/I mutations in H3.1 are identified.\nAuthors: Chao Lu, Siddhant U. Jain, Dominik Hoelper, Denise Bechet, Rosalynn C.

Perkel</dc:creator>\n<description><![CDATA[From van Leeuwenhoek to the new millennium, microscopy was governed by one seemingly unbreakable principle: The ability to resolve two objects is constrained by the wavelength of the light used to view them. But in 2000, researchers showed this so-called diffraction limit could be broken, unveiling over the next decade an alphabet soup of superresolution techniques from GSDIM and PALM to SIM, STED, and STORM. The\nresulting images are both beautiful and revealing, documenting biological phenomena and structures that researchers never even knew they were missing.Read the Feature (Full-Text HTML)Read the Feature (PDF)Read New Products (PDF)\nAuthor: Jeffrey M.
