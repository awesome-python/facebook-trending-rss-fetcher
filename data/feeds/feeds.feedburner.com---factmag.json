The plans were changed after Bowie&#8217;s death said Goaz, who plays Deputy Andy Brennan, in an interview with <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/arts/headlines/20160511-dallas-actor-returns-to-twin-peaks.ece\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Dallas Morning News</strong></a>. </p>\n<p>He wouldn&#8217;t have been the only musician either &#8212;  Nine Inch Nails&#8217; Trent Reznor, Sky Ferreira and Pearl Jam&#8217;s Eddie Vedder and Sky Ferreira and <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2016/04/25/twin-peaks-showtime-full-cast/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>more are set to make appearances</strong></a> as well. </p>\n<p>Though he only has a brief appearance in the film, the character Agent Jeffries is spoken of frequently and remains a puzzling figure. In true Lynch fashion, Bowie&#8217;s appearance doesn&#8217;t exactly answer any more questions, but leaves a powerful impression. Watch it and look for <i>Twin Peaks</i> in 2017. </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3nSqDMqCJQw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/13/david-bowie-david-lynch-twin-peaks-reboot/\">David Bowie was going to appear in David Lynch&#8217;s <i>Twin Peaks</i> reboot</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.factmag.com\">FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/13/david-bowie-david-lynch-twin-peaks-reboot/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Ghost Town DJs\u2019 classic \u2018My Boo\u2019 is back on the Billboard charts 20 years later</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/12/ghost-town-djs-my-boo-billboard-hot-100-2016/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/12/ghost-town-djs-my-boo-billboard-hot-100-2016/#respond</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:16:02 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Claire Lobenfeld]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ghost Town DJs]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[So So Def]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.factmag.com/?p=323031</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Ghost Town DJs&#8217; massive &#8216;My Boo&#8217; is more successful now than when it debuted in 1996.

(And unlike &#8216;Harlem Shake&#8217;, this actually utilizes the real dance it&#8217;s named after.)</p>\n<p>According to <em><strong><a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7364708/ghost-town-djs-my-boo-viral-dance-hot-100\">Billboard</a></strong></em>, athletes were the first to mimic Vincent and Hall&#8217;s clips &#8211; basketball team the Atlanta Hawks even <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ATLHawks/status/729335129215131648\">held a contest</a></strong> at a recent playoff game &#8211; but it has since gone on to be so popular that originators were featured on <em>Ellen</em> (<strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LUX70mXcEE\">as any meme-creator does</a></strong>). It has also gotten &#8216;My Boo&#8217; higher on the Hot 100 than ever before.</p>\n<p><em>Billboard</em> reports that it will re-enter the Hot 100 at #29, having peaked at #31 in October 1996. It will re-debut on the Hot R&#038;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at #14 when it had only previously reached #18. As of May 5, it has sold 35,000 digital units, landing it at #8 on the R&#038;B Digital Songs chart.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been streamed 12.3 million times in the US, which is 147% more than its usual play &#8211; songs of the summer never get old, even when they&#8217;re from the \u201990s &#8211; with 1.5 million reported from Spotify and 80% from YouTube. It should be noted that Tidal streams do not count toward the Billboard chart, so there could ostensibly more.</p>\n<p>Interest in &#8216;My Boo&#8217; was reinvigorated in 2013 when Ciara released &#8216;Body Party&#8217;, which interpolated the track &#8211; but nothing compares this.</p>\n<p>Watch the video for &#8216;My Boo&#8217; plus King Louie and a member of Rae Sremmurd dancing to it below.</p>\n<div class=\"embed\"><iframe width=\"501\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QxRiwnmYjMg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Louie killed it <a href=\"https://t.co/Ka3jZlJ9Wk\">pic.twitter.com/Ka3jZlJ9Wk</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; XXL Magazine (@XXL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XXL/status/729849457047539712\">May 10, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SremmLife2?src=hash\">#SremmLife2</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EarDrummerSummer?src=hash\">#EarDrummerSummer</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Xhgt3v8kcg\">pic.twitter.com/Xhgt3v8kcg</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Swae Lee Slim Jxmmi (@RaeSremmurd) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaeSremmurd/status/724786124401610753\">April 26, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/12/ghost-town-djs-my-boo-billboard-hot-100-2016/\">Ghost Town DJs&#8217; classic &#8216;My Boo&#8217; is back on the Billboard charts 20 years later</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.factmag.com\">FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/12/ghost-town-djs-my-boo-billboard-hot-100-2016/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Novelist declares his own genre Ruff Sound with 40-minute Rinse session</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/12/novelist-ruff-sound-rinse/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/12/novelist-ruff-sound-rinse/#respond</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:08:15 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Miles Bowe]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Novelist]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.factmag.com/?p=323029</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve started a new genre,&#8221; says the grime MC.

It&#8217;s not just sound either, Mutek&#8217;s focus on digital arts encourages A/V performance, and often hosts a number of exciting debuts.</p>\n<p>This year, Mutek Montr\u00e9al&#8217;s line up is more diverse and bold than ever, pitting well-known veterans like Tim Hecker and Atom TM against vital new talent such as footwork innovator Jlin, Iranian producer Ash Koosha and the Naafi-associated Siete Catorce.</p>\n<p>The following list highlights 10 must-see performances, and you can read the entire schedule and purchase passes over at <strong><a href=\"http://www.mutek.org/en/montreal/2016\" target=\"_blank\">Mutek&#8217;s website</a></strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"http://factmag-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ashkoosha-5.10.2016.jpg\" alt=\"Mutek 2016 - Ash Koosha\" width=\"1000\" height=\"430\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-322370\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Ash Koosha<br />\nNOCTURNE 1 at Mus\u00e9e d&#8217;art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al<br />\nJune 1</strong></p>\n<p>We were massive fans of Ash Koosha&#8217;s spidery 2015 debut <em>GUUD</em>, and he didn&#8217;t waste any time at all following it up, dropping <em>I AKA I</em> on Ninja Tune last month. His blend of fractured electronics and decomposed club sounds should be just right for the live stage, and his Mutek performance &#8211; a Canadian premiere &#8211; will be accompanied by Koosha&#8217;s own visuals.</p>\n<p>Harnessing innovative VR technology (which he talked about in a recent <strong><a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2016/03/02/ash-koosha-interview-ninja-tune-virtual-reality/\" target=\"_blank\">FACT interview with Miles Bowe</a></strong>), Koosha will trigger imagery and effects using the Oculus Rift, something we reckon will need to be seen to be believed.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"http://factmag-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aishadevi-5.10.2016.jpg\" alt=\"Mutek 2016 - Aisha Devi\" width=\"1226\" height=\"527\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-322371\" /></p>\n<p><strong>A\u00efsha Devi<br />\nNOCTURNE 1 at Mus\u00e9e d&#8217;art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al<br />\nJune 1</strong></p>\n<p>A\u00efsha Devi&#8217;s music is informed by her spirituality and meditation, but don&#8217;t for a second assume that it&#8217;s simply &#8220;new age&#8221;. Her debut album <em>Of Matter And Spirit</em> was titled after a book written by her grandfather, a physicist who worked at CERN, and her music takes its cues from across the spectrum, blending them into a soup of fuzzy electronics.</p>\n<p>Her Mutek performance will see Devi create alongside visual artist TIANZHUO CHEN, manipulating her voice and working with ideas from Bangladeshi poet Kishwar Naheed. Devi was reportedly a highlight of this year&#8217;s CTM in Berlin, so it&#8217;s going to be one to mark on the calendar.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"http://factmag-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/colleen-5.10.2016.jpg\" alt=\"Mutek 2016 - Colleen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"430\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-322372\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Colleen<br />\nNOCTURNE 3 at Mus\u00e9e d&#8217;art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al<br />\nJune 3</strong></p>\n<p>While plenty of musicians on this list will have ended up on the live stage almost by accident, crafting music at home or in a studio without considering how it might work in a live environment, C\u00e9cile Schott, aka Colleen, is different. She&#8217;s always flourished on the stage, and her delicate compositions spring to life there more than they ever could on record.</p>\n<p>Schott has been performing for some time now, perfecting her craft and experimenting with different instrumentation &#8211; live, she now experiments with a handful of small instruments and, more recently, her voice.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"http://factmag-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jlin-5.10.2016.jpg\" alt=\"Mutek 2016 - Jlin\" width=\"1448\" height=\"623\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-322373\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Jlin<br />\nNOCTURNE 3 at Mus\u00e9e d&#8217;art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al<br />\nJune 3</strong></p>\n<p>To replicate a genre of music is relatively easy, but to innovate, now that&#8217;s where the difficulty really lies.

Whatever happens, we&#8217;re expecting to hear a taste of Jlin&#8217;s second album, which is tentatively titled either <em>Black Origami: The Motherboard</em> or <em>Black Origami: The Dark Lotus</em>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"http://factmag-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/karalis-5.10.2016.jpg\" alt=\"Mutek 2016 - Kara-Lis Coverdale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"430\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-322374\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Kara-Lis Coverdale<br />\nNOCTURNE 2 at Mus\u00e9e d&#8217;art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al<br />\nJune 2</strong></p>\n<p>On last year&#8217;s ambient masterpiece <em>Sirens</em>, Canadian composer Kara-Lis Coverdale collaborated with LXV (musician David Sutton) to rustle up one of the best records we heard in 2015. <em>Aftertouches</em>, Coverdale&#8217;s solo LP also from last year, was equally as beguiling, showing a talent that was informed by academic practice, but not bound to it by any means.</p>\n<p>At least year&#8217;s Mutek Montr\u00e9al, Coverdale&#8217;s performance was reported to be one of the festival&#8217;s highlights, and she&#8217;s not only back to perform once again, but she&#8217;s written a brand new live set just for the occasion.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"http://factmag-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/leegamble-5.10.2016.jpg\" alt=\"Mutek 2016 - Lee Gamble\" width=\"1381\" height=\"594\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-322375\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Lee Gamble &#038; Dave Gaskarth<br />\nNOCTURNE 1 at Mus\u00e9e d&#8217;art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al<br />\nJune 1</strong></p>\n<p>We shouldn&#8217;t need to introduce PAN&#8217;s Lee Gamble at this point &#8211; his refried techno constructions and ambient jungle nostalgia have kept us busy with the hyperbole for years now.

It was known for pioneering a very specific sound: bassline, the bubbly bass-heavy genre that emerged from the ashes of speed garage, that would surge in popularity through parts of the North and the Midlands before being criminalized. Frankly, people were having too much fun.</p>\n<p>One of the scene&#8217;s long-standing DJs, Jamie Duggan (who, by his own admission, made the club his &#8220;second home for 7 full years, 52 weekends a year&#8221;), <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jamie.j.duggan/posts/1047126578701180\" target=\"_blank\">posted publicly on Facebook</a></strong> today that after over a decade of closure, the Northern landmark was finally being demolished. Niche was shut down in November 2005 following a massive police raid, and while owner Steve Baxendale managed to open the club in a second location in 2009, it closed for good a year later.</p>\n<p>In the last 10 years, Duggan has attempted &#8220;opening the place back up a couple of times&#8221;, even going as far as emptying the rubble, filling &#8220;two giant skips&#8221;. Sadly his attempts were stymied by the local council and police, who no doubt still equated bassline, and Niche, with the criminality that forced its closure in the first place.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://factmag-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/niche2-5.12.2016.jpg\" alt=\"Niche nightclub\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-322992\" /></p>\n<p>For more information on bassline&#8217;s rise and fall, check out Channel 4&#8217;s <em><strong><a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2014/11/14/watch-channel-4s-music-nation-documentary-on-northern-bassline/\" target=\"_blank\">It&#8217;s Bass Up North</em> documentary</a></strong>, and relive better times with DJ Q&#8217;s excellent 2012 FACT mix below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"670\" height=\"376\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F56141002&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=670&#038;maxheight=376\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/12/niche-nightclub-to-be-demolished/\">Sheffield&#8217;s iconic Niche nightclub to be demolished</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.factmag.com\">FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/12/niche-nightclub-to-be-demolished/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Chance the Rapper enlists 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne for \u2018No Problem\u2019</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/12/chance-the-rapper-no-problem-featuring-2-chainz-lil-wayne/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.factmag.com/2016/05/12/chance-the-rapper-no-problem-featuring-2-chainz-lil-wayne/#respond</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:50:47 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Claire Lobenfeld]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2 Chainz]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Chance the Rapper]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[lil wayne]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.factmag.com/?p=322990</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Before Chance 3 drops, the Chicago native teases another track.
