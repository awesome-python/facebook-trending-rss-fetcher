In a world where coal, nuclear and gas are still seen as the main energy sources Germany managed to use the sun, wind and rain to <a href=\"https://www.agora-energiewende.de/de/ueber-uns/\" target=\"_blank\">provide 87 per cent of an entire country's energy requirements</a>.</p><br />\n<p>It's an astonishing achievement and one that unfortunately the industry just wasn't expecting.</p><br />\n<p>You see one of the biggest problems with renewable energy is that it's not constant - it's dependent unsurprisingly on the weather.</p><br />\n<p>So to compensate for when it's raining and foggy Germany has to keep some of its nuclear and coal plants running.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>However when the sun comes out it gets really tricky because while renewables are by definition flexible at turning on and off you can't just flick and switch and turn off a nuclear power plant.</p><br />\n<p>They take enormous amounts of time and planning to do, and so by the time the price of energy had plummeted into the negative it was simply too late for anyone to do anything about it.</p><br />\n<p>There's even better news on the horizon for Germany as the country has the ambitious target of becoming 100 per cent renewable by 2050.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>It's an incredible target to set itself and it's actually one that Denmark is already hitting.</p><br />\n<p>While it's not a constant, the Guardian pointed out that in July last year Denmark's wind power was generating 140 per cent of its demand - allowing for the energy to be sent over to Germany, Norway and Sweden.</p><br />\n<p>Denmark isn't the only place on planet Earth that's tackling the energy revolution. Costa Rica spent 75 days last year being <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/03/25/costa-rica-is-being-powered-entirely-by-wind-and-rain_n_6937610.html\" target=\"_blank\">powered entirely by renewable energy sources.</a>site</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Then there's big businesses as well with <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/tesla-model-3-electric-car-orders-hit-276000-this-weekend_uk_57024afee4b0c5bd919b6367\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla's utterly gargantuan Gigafactory</a> being powered solely by solar, or Apple's pledge to become a company that's entirely <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/05/11/apple-pledges-to-become-a-company-thats-powered-entirely-by-renewable-energy_n_7255380.html\" target=\"_blank\">powered by renewable energy.</a></p> ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/57349205160000b60731e8e4.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/megan-morgan/the-emotions-of-timehop_b_9924926.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[The Emotions of Timehop]]></title>\n      <author>Megan Morgan</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/megan-morgan/the-emotions-of-timehop_b_9924926.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-tech&amp;ir=UK+Tech</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:51:12 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-12-1463045693-2531129-whitstable.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-12-1463045693-2531129-whitstable.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-12-1463045693-2531129-whitstable-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"322\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe other day, the above picture popped up in my Facebook feed via Timehop, it immediately made me smile and reflect on the time at which it had be taken.<br />\n<br />\nIt had been a long winter: Cold and miserable, but mainly stressful. <br />\n<br />\nAfter a constant struggle with cancer for 18 months, my Dad had died in the March. I was broken by his illness and his death. It was excruciating to watch him as he tried to desperately survive, and selfishly, I was knackered by it all, to speak in the vernacular. <br />\n<br />\nIn addition to this, we had started a massive build on our home. Although, the outcome was amazing, the whole process just compounded my stress: The endless negotiating with the builders, the continual layer of dirt that covered my house from top to bottom, the wrangling of party wall agreements, the relentless cold winter winds blowing in the back of tarp-covered house, not to mention the diminished living space and no garden made for a fretful time.<br />\n<br />\nThis picture was taken while we had a mini break in Kent over a bank holiday. We had primarily escaped to have a break from our building site of a house, but it also coincided with the nicest weather we'd seen that year. We'd spent the first day at an wildlife park, and the second day, by the sea in Whitstable. The sun and shone (and it was warm!), we'd spent the whole time outdoors, eaten some delicious meals, and been together as a four and laughed and enjoyed just being together. <br />\n<br />\nI remember that weekend I had really enjoyed the moment, I hadn't dwelled on the past, the future or indeed the present and the seemingly endless issues with building. I'd just drunk in the happy atmosphere of being somewhere lovely and being happy. <br />\n<br />\nThree years on, and looking back at that picture, it made me stop and reflect: I'd always seen 2013 as my 'annus horribilus', but in fact it wasn't. In spite of the stresses and issues it threw at me, it was a remarkably happy year with some wonderful moments in it, and even though right then I probably wasn't thinking it, I was wonderfully lucky in so many ways.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, I've come a long way from those dark days of initial grief, and though you never get over the death of a parent, I have learnt to live with it. <br />\n<br />\nTimehop, thank you for reshowing me a photo I'd largely forgotten about, but tells me so much - there's always light at the end of the tunnel, and that picture encapsulates me finding it.<br />\n<br />\nThis post was originally posted on<a href=\"http://www.trulymadlykids.co.uk\" target=\"_hplink\"> Truly Madly Kids</a><br />\n<br />\nYou can find Truly Madly Kids on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/trulymadlykidsUK/\" target=\"_hplink\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrulyMadly7\" target=\"_hplink\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tmkuk/\" target=\"_hplink\">Instagram  </a> ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1424693/images/s-FACEBOOK-TEEN-AGERS-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/05/12/air-pollution-uk-most-polluted-city_n_9926826.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[WHO Air Pollution Stats Show London, Brighton And Glasgow Have Dangerously High Levels]]></title>\n      <author>Louise Ridley</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/05/12/air-pollution-uk-most-polluted-city_n_9926826.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-tech&amp;ir=UK+Tech</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 08:13:08 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[<p>More than 40 cities and towns across the UK are breaching safe limits for <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/air-pollution/\">air pollution,</a> according to new data from the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/world-health-organisation\">World Health Organisation</a> (WHO).</p><br />\n<p>Nottingham, London and Southampton among those named in a report for having dangerously high levels that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/this-is-what-air-pollution-is-doing-to-your-body_uk_57345c44e4b01359f6868ebe\">could be causing serious illnesses, according to the WHO.</a></p><br />\n<p>More than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air that is too polluted, in what campaigners and the WHO called \"a public health crisis\" that is \"wreaking havoc on human health\".</p><br />\n<p>Oxford, Leeds and Glasgow were also singled out as suffering from pollution linked to respiratory and cardiovascular-related illnesses.</p><br />\n<p>'Ambient' air pollution, made up of small particles in the air, is said to cause &nbsp;more than three million premature deaths around the world each year.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Eleven urban areas in the UK breach the recommended levels for PM<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;pollution, a measure of the concentration of particles in the air.</p><br />\n<p>The 11 areas exceed the safe level of 20 micrograms per cubic metre, with Port Talbot in Wales, with a reading of 25 micrograms in 2013.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>Global urban air pollution levels increased by 8% between 2008 and 2013, the report says, despite improvements in some areas.</p><br />\n<p>Over 40 UK towns and cities breached the safe limit for another measure called PM<sub>2.5</sub></p><br />\n<p>Jenny Bates, a Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, said: \"This is yet another report which shows the air we breathe is unsafe. With 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK from air pollution, what more will it take for our political leaders to act?\"</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>\"This is a public health crisis. It&rsquo;s time it was treated that way. We need fewer and cleaner vehicles with a Clean Air Zone in every city and large town &ndash; and politicians must urgently introduce a diesel scrappage scheme to get the worst polluting vehicles off our roads, as well as more investment in alternatives to driving.&rsquo;</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;Urban air pollution continues to rise at an alarming rate, wreaking havoc on human health,&rdquo; said Dr Maria Neira, a WHO Director.</p><br />\n<p>&ldquo;At the same time, awareness is rising and more cities are monitoring their air quality.

It's on the UK government's agenda, but what exactly is the skills gap and what do we need to be doing to prevent the UK workforce from becoming victim to it? To approach the skills gap proactively, we need first to look at the research behind it to understand what it is and why it's important that we act now to make sure that today's students are prepared for an increasingly digital workplace.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.cipd.co.uk/pm/peoplemanagement/b/weblog/archive/2016/01/28/one-in-four-jobs-go-unfilled-due-to-skills-shortage-ukces-reveals.aspx\" target=\"_hplink\">Findings from the UK Commission of Employment and Skills (UKCES)</a> reveal that already one in four jobs are going unfilled in the UK workforce due to skills shortage necessary for those positions, up by four per cent since 2013. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10985961/Britain-faces-growing-shortage-of-digital-skills.html\" target=\"_hplink\">Additional task force reports</a> predict that this will only become exacerbated in the coming decades, when digital skills become even more in-demand.  'Digital skills' is a catch-all phrase that encompasses everything from knowing how to check email and work social media, to more advanced functions like working with software and programming computers. All of these individual activities are part of a digital whole that will redefine every job in the information economy in the years to come.<br />\n<br />\nIf the UK does not act now to invest in and promote digital skill building starting at the primary school level, then we risk falling behind other countries who have made huge strides in supporting their future workforce. Our best chance of developing a solution to the emerging skills gap in the UK is by taking a concerted joint effort between the government, industry and volunteer-led organisations. Working together with educators, these three bodies can have real, large scale impact on the opportunities young people have for learning digital skills to prepare them for the future.<br />\n<br />\nStarting with primary school teachers, we must ensure that all education professionals receive proper training so that they can, in turn, educate students in subjects that will be in increased demand in the coming decades, such as computer science. At first glance, this may appear to be a difficult proposition, given the sheer number of teachers at work in the UK (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/number-of-schools-teachers-and-students-in-england\" target=\"_hplink\">over 400,000</a>).  No one wishes more than I that there was a magic bullet to solve this issue -- it will take consistent time, effort, and sustained financial investment from the government, industry, and volunteer-led organisations.<br />\n<br />\nThe UK government has begun to act. In 2014, it provided the British Computing Society with <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/uk-government-backs-year-of-code-campaign-boosts-funds-to-teach-code-in-schools/\" target=\"_hplink\">more than \u00a32 million to train teachers</a> on computing skills including coding so that they could then effectively teach these skills to their students. This type of government support and resource allocation is key, but it alone won't solve the skills gap. By involving industry and not-for-profit educational organisations to play a direct role in setting the agenda for education, the government's efforts can be significantly bolstered. <br />\n<br />\nWhere the government must contend with limited funds and red tape surrounding educational programs, industry, on the other hand, moves at a rapid pace. One way in which the private sector can give back to communities and help shape the next generation of its own potential recruits, is by volunteering to help educate and inspire local schoolchildren. Financial investment is important, but investing resources such as knowledge, outreach, and time into communities is equally so. Volunteering is incredibly powerful and it needn't cost a thing -- in fact many companies report that they see their volunteers' skills increase and have been able to use the opportunity to attract top candidates who want to work for a company that gives back to their community.<br />\n<br />\nVolunteer-led educational programs, working with industry, can contribute to a solution at scale. And scale is the key here. There are currently approximately 21,000 primary schools in the UK. If there were a volunteer-led skills building initiative in every school, the potential for national impact on skill building could be significant. <br />\n<br />\nWorking both with the government and separately to help prevent a skills shortage is a conscientious and socially responsible approach which can also reap dividends for the private sector. By investing resources such as time and mentorship locally, private organisations large or small can directly contribute to fostering tomorrow's innovators and future candidates for their own recruitment pools.<br />\n<br />\nIt's simple for the private sector to involve itself in volunteer activities. There are many options for companies to give back to their local communities by engaging in volunteer-led programs that make a difference at the primary school level and beyond. For example, at Code Club, over 50% of the volunteers come from private sector companies. They volunteer their time to help children aged 9-11 learn to solve problems and valuable computer skills by leading coding projects in any one of 4,000 after-school Code Clubs across the UK. The benefit to both the volunteers, the community and (most importantly) the students, is huge. <br />\n<br />\nIf we are to bridge the skills gap, it requires everyone's effort, collectively. Industry big and small, government, and voluntary organisations working together can build a positive future for Britain's workforce. It is wholly doable if we start now. ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3337804/images/s-DEFAULT-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-helen-rippon/science-peer-reviews_b_9868882.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Would You Want Your Best Ideas Openly Scrutinized? Scientists Do]]></title>\n      <author>Dr Helen Rippon</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-helen-rippon/science-peer-reviews_b_9868882.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-tech&amp;ir=UK+Tech</link>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 11:33:17 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[Would you want your most cherished ideas openly criticised by your colleagues and competitors?<br />\n<br />\nScientists do. In fact, it's an essential part of the scientific method. But that still doesn't make it nice. <br />\n<br />\nPeer review is regarded by many as an indispensable, if sometimes unwieldy, cog in the science machine. It's what makes science 'go'. But to non-scientists it can seem a bizarre process.<br />\n<br />\nWhy? Because it means giving the game away. Essentially, what happens is that scientists invite potential competitors to wade about in their best scientific ideas, searching for difficulties and rooting out flaws within. The people they are trying to beat are up to their armpits in their precious, hard-earned data.<br />\n<br />\nThis kind of thing just doesn't happen in many other professions. Imagine mobile phone companies demanding full access to each other's boardrooms. Imagine competing supermarkets inviting each other to pore over business plans, and offer 'helpful' criticism.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, peer review for research is not quite as bonkers as this. But you get the general idea. And scientists have to do this on a routine basis. Science works by having new theories, ideas, and findings put through the wringer. To be tested, debated, and tested again. It sounds uncomfortable, and it often is. The process is not without its faults.<br />\n<br />\nEven with checks in place, the peer review process can still be inefficient and sometimes even subverted for ulterior motives, whether deliberately or not. Scientists are only human, after all. Much recent discussion revolves around how peer review could be improved, or in some circumstances, done away with altogether. But it's currently the best way of separating the most promising from the mundane, the flawed from the real - of helping the best science shine through.<br />\n<br />\nWorldwide Cancer Research funds around <a href=\"http://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/research/projects\" target=\"_hplink\">50 new research projects</a> every year - it's a good amount, but we'd like to fund more. As usual it comes down to cold hard cash. In the mean time our peer review process ensures we can sift out the best research applications to fund.<br />\n<br />\nEffective peer review takes a lot of time and effort. For our charity, a single grant application can take as long as 6 months to make it through our 'gold-standard' peer review process <a href=\"http://www.amrc.org.uk/publications/principles-peer-review\" target=\"_hplink\">set by the AMRC.</a> <br />\n<br />\nBecause our remit is so broad (funding applications from any and every country)  we have a particularly large \"Dragons' Den\" of stellar scientists to review our applications. If you think the likes of Duncan Bannatyne and Deborah Meaden are a tough crowd, imagine pitching to 24 of the top science brains in Europe, all out to decide whether your idea is worth that precious funding. Only the very best are then sent out for further scrutinising by more expert scientists from around the world. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-09-1462801822-2869885-SACGroup.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-09-1462801822-2869885-SACGroup.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-09-1462801822-2869885-SACGroup-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"285\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nSwap the starkly-lit warehouse for a modest hotel meeting room in Edinburgh, imagine the pitches made in writing instead of person, and you begin to get the idea.<br />\n<br />\nAdmittedly most scientists don't look quite so fearsome as the Dragons. But they are just as deadly serious when it comes down to business. They even ask virtually the same questions. Is this research new? Is it needed? Is anyone else doing it? Is the applicant able to do what they say they will, that is, are they properly skilled-up? Are they asking for the right amount of money? And perhaps most importantly, could this research really make a difference?<br />\n<br />\nBut unlike the real Dragons, scientific peer-reviewers don't stand to financially gain from all the review work they put in, it is all done for free. The scientist must often perform these duties over and above their own day-to-day research activities, and that can mean a lot of late nights.<br />\n<br />\nSo what's it like to have your work scrutinised in such agonising detail? During my time in research I remember waiting for reviewer comments with bated breath. Did the reviewer agree that this research was as exciting, and potentially ground breaking as I did? A review can make or break your chances of funding. A 'good' review meant celebrations. A 'bad' review commiserations and back to the drawing board.<br />\n<br />\nI might not have always agreed with the reviewers' points, sometimes I found them downright infuriating. But after I'd calmed down, I often reluctantly agreed that the points raised were valid, and necessary. Ultimately, they made me a better scientist.<br />\n<br />\n\"In general, studies are almost always improved by critical input by other scientists.\" Says Paul Coffer, Professor of Cell Biology at UMC Utrecht and Worldwide Cancer Research Scientific Committee member. \"Peer-review is not just important, it is essential. Without it we would have the scientific literature overflowing with poorly performed research and uninterpretable clinical trials. A solid peer-review system allows us to see the wood from the trees and moves science forward.\"<br />\n<br />\nAnd that's just the point. Scientists may well be working in competition, they may even like to get a sneaky peek at others' ideas - and reviewing can give an excellent opportunity to do just that. But ultimately everyone's working towards the same goal- to improve science, to drive knowledge forward and, in the case of cancer research, to improve lives.<br />\n<br />\nSo it turns out the Dragons might not be so scary after all.<br />\n<em><br />\nThis article first appeared on <a href=\"http://www.whereverittakesus.org/\" target=\"_hplink\">Worldwide Cancer Resarch's blog.</a></em>

href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/payday-loans/\" target=\"_blank\">payday loan</a> adverts on its search results.</p><br />\n<p>This is the first time that Google has announced a global ban on adverts of a particular category of financial services and is being hailed by civil rights advocates as an important first step in protecting the vulnerable.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>The global ban means that any payday loan company that demands payment within 60 days will be banned, while in the US the search engine is taking an even stronger stance by banning any ad for a loan with an APR of 36 per cent of higher.</p><br />\n<p><a href=\"http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/an-update-to-our-adwords-policy-on.html\" target=\"_blank\">David Graff, Director, Global Product Policy explained</a>: \"This change is designed to protect our users from deceptive or harmful financial products.\"</p><br />\n<p>Google disabled nearly 800 million adverts in 2015 alone with the financial sector becoming a particular area of vigilance for the company.</p><br />\n<br />\n<p>The bold move by Google has come after a coalition of advocates from within the financial and civil rights movements pushed for harsher restrictions on payday loans.</p><br />\n<p>Wade Henderson, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said:&nbsp;&ldquo;Banning predatory payday loan ads shows that Google is willing to put people before profits.\"</p><br />\n<p>\"This new policy addresses many of the longstanding concerns shared by the entire civil rights community about predatory payday lending.\"</p><br />\n<p>Payday loan ads will now join firearm and tobacco adverts on the banned list.</p><br />\n<p>The changes will come into effect on 13 July 2016.</p> ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/5733391c160000e90031e709.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid

But, if you spill a whole bag of tiny crumbs, you're going to need a broom.

I reached for fast forward, but it was actually refreshing to hear the subject debated by two scientists. Scientists who were just so, well, reasonable! Though representing opposite sides, they clearly respected each other, agreed with a lot of what each other said, and only based their statements on facts from peer-reviewed science. It made a pleasant change from the petty point-scoring of power playing politicians and the vox pop bleats from rent-a-rants on the street. <br />\n<br />\nHowever, even the pro-Brexit voice willingly conceded that his fellow scientists are overwhelmingly in favour of staying in the EU. The House of Lords Science and Technology committee have been collecting reports from the scientific community since 2015, and report exactly this; to the extent that the committee really struggled to find pro-Brexit voices to provide balance in their debates. They concluded that what we contribute to the EU, and receive back for research, leaves us with a considerable net gain. There was a lot of talk of Horizon 2020, the EU's monumental scientific initiative with 80billion euros of funding available for research before... err, 2020. We have disproportionate impact and influence in European science policy, which we could lose if we leave. <br />\n<br />\nSo what about wildlife? The Greens are convinced Britain should remain in the EU for the sake of the environment. Former environment secretary Owen Paterson on the other hand is for Brexit. It struck me that I didn't know anything like enough about the issue, so I decided to contact my friends in conservation organisations, to find out what they think. <br />\n<br />\nMy first port of call was Buglife, the first wildlife charity who'd have me as vice president way back in my <em>Really Wild Show</em> days. The real work at Buglife is done by stupefyingly intelligent entomologists, with a genuine passion for creepy crawlies. Their goal is to protect the small things that make the world go round, and to my eye they have always been apolitical. CEO Matt Shardlow had this to say: <br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\"...the EU has benefited bugs in many ways and in our expert opinion continuing to work closely with other countries in the EU to fix environmental problems should bring more benefits to the continent's wildlife than the UK going it alone.\" </blockquote><br />\n<br />\nHis colleague Paul Hetherington adds: <br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\"While British politicians in Brussels have been introducing regulations that have transformed wildlife and environmental custodianship across Europe, back in Britain their counterparts and superiors have very largely not matched their zeal for a better future. The UK is also to be found blocking new EU efforts to improve air quality, ban harmful pesticides, introduce legislation to protect soils and confirm new measures to check that candidate pesticides do not harm bumblebees or solitary bees.\"</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nBuglife have done a thorough risk assessment of Brexit, which can be found online. But much of it rests on the fact that our fauna and flora here in the UK is essentially European. After all, many of our butterflies, dragonflies and bees travel to and from the continent, as do some of the diseases and pollutants that threaten them.<br />\n<br />\nAnd what about the birds? They are legendary in their wanton disregard for passports and national borders. Martin Harper, RSPB's Director of Conservation, said much the same:<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\"Given that nature knows no boundaries (for example birds migrate), the RSPB has always believed we need to act internationally especially as the threats (such as pollution) are often diffuse.  Comprehensive international agreements for nature conservation and the environment are therefore essential.\"</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nOK so that one was quite careful. Less so was Graham Buckingham of Bite-Back Shark and Marine Conservation. Graham quit his job to set up the charity in his bedroom (for which he should surely get a Pride of Britain award?), and is currently battling to change the EU ruling that allows anyone entering Europe to import 20kg of shark fins for 'personal consumption'.<br />\n <br />\nGraham said: <br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\"As it stands, with support from three or four strong EU allies, the UK can spearhead a campaign that can change the law across all 28 member states. However, if the UK leaves the EU we will be forced to campaign in multiple countries to achieve the same result. A vote to leave the EU could set shark conservation initiatives back a decade.\" </blockquote><br />\n<br />\nWell, I didn't expect Graham to sit on the fence. Another shark saviour, Ali Hood (Director of Conservation for the Shark Trust) added: <br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\"Whilst Brexit would give the UK an independent voice in International fora, in the absence of the UK's influence within the EU, we could see the loss, or even reversal, of the EU's commitment to shark and ray management.\"  Guy Stevens, Founder and Chief Executive of the Manta Trust agreed; \"Brexit would disadvantage UK charities ability to raise funds in the EU and reduce conservation initiatives for sharks and rays in Europe\".</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nSimilar sentiments came from Richard Benwell of the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust, who said:<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\"It's clear that no country can save nature alone. While it's not the only way to cooperate, the EU has been the foundation of UK conservation for so many years that Brexit would mean years of challenge and uncertainty for organisations like the WWT.\"</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nWell what about a much more domestic perspective? Conservation really has to begin on your own home patch, so my next call was to Estelle Bailey, who runs my local Wildlife Trust, another person I trust. One example of an issue that affects the counties I've lived in since birth, is that some heathland is protected under the Habitats Directive because they provide breeding territory for threatened species like the nightjar and Dartford warbler. If we leave the EU Local Councillors have already called for their protection to be downgraded, because it makes it more expensive to develop houses nearby. Estelle did however agree with my friends at the WWF, who mentioned that the EU has been far from perfect when it comes to farming policy, fisheries, flood protection and clean water. Both organisations agreed that either way there would be both benefits and challenges, though WWF sum up: \"on balance, Britain's membership of the EU has delivered benefits for our environment.\" <br />\n<br />\nMy last email was to the organization I most recently became a patron of, the World Land Trust. Most of their work is in far-flung exotic jungles, so I was expecting a different perspective. I wasn't expecting them to put me straight in touch with Boris Johnson's dad Stanley! He's one of their vocal supporters, and believes his son has it wrong when it comes to the EU and the environment. Stanley states that: \"As the parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee inquiry points out... as members of the EU we can push for reforms that protect nature across borders. Leaving puts that at risk. It threatens air and water quality, risks removing safeguards for natural habitats, affects our ability to reduce our carbon footprint and much more.\" He goes on to say that the EU is in need of development and overhaul, but that to pull out completely would be hugely damaging.<br />\n<br />\nI used to be strongly against the whole idea of a referendum. I thought the implications were too complex for the likes of me to tackle. Surely this is why we have politicians and civil servants who've done PPE at Oxbridge; to figure these things out for us? I didn't want decisions that massive made by me - or by some bloke at the pub, based on the fact he's never much liked the French! I know though that I can't cop out of it anymore. Our membership of the EU is a huge subject, infinitely complex and potentially impacting every aspect of life. The environment is just one element, and neither I - nor any of the organisations I spoke to - believe in telling anyone how to vote. I will base my decision on what's important to me, I believe you should do the same. ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3824862/images/s-STEVE-BACKSHALL-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
