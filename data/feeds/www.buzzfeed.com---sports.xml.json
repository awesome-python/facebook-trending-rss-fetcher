The series was scheduled to take place May 30 and 31 at Roberto Clemente Stadium. \n\n&#x22;After discussing the issue with all involved parties, and consulting with federal and Puerto Rican government officials at the highest levels, Commissioner Manfred decided that the players who objected to the trip because of their specific family situations should not be forced to travel to Puerto Rico,&#x22; the league and union said in a press release. &#x22;Because too many regulars on both Clubs fell into that category, Commissioner Manfred had no choice but to relocate the games.&#x22;\n\nEarlier this week, when it was announced that baseball was considering moving the series, Rep. Angel Matos, Chairman of the Committee for Tourism Industry, called it &#x22;an outrageous situation.&#x22;\n\nIn a statement to the &#x3C;i&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://triblive.com/news/editorspicks/10418091-74/zika-puerto-rico&#x22;&#x3E;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, Matos said: &#x22;The reality is that this cancellation is unfair, disproportionate, and makes our country look bad. It&#x27;s an act of touristic terrorism.&#x22;\n\n&#x22;Commissioner Manfred and the MLBPA fully understand the disappointment by those in Puerto Rico to the relocation of the games,&#x22; the league and union said in a statement. &#x22;MLB and the Players Association did everything possible to adequately address the concerns raised by players and still play the games in Puerto Rico, but despite extensive efforts, they were unable to develop a workable solution.&#x22;\n\nAs of May 4, there have been 629 cases of Zika contracted in Puerto Rico, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/united-states.html&#x22;&#x3E;according&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to the CDC. Two cases have been recorded in Puerto Rico that were contracted outside the country. In Florida, there have been 95 recorded cases of Zika, but all from travel elsewhere and none transmitted by mosquitos in Florida.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Indiana Basketball Coach To Plead Guilty To Sexting 15-Year-Old Student</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyadler/indiana-basketball-coach-to-plead-guilty-to-sexting-15-year?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>Kyle Cox faces up to 14 years in prison for coercing a minor to send him sexually explicit messages and videos, prosecutors say.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/5/14/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-25916-1462474128-2.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"417\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p><small>Kyle Cox</small></p>\n\n\n <p><small>Aj Mast / AP</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>A high school basketball coach in Indiana will plead guilty to exchanging sexually explicit images with a 15-year-old female student, according to court documents filed Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>Kyle Cox faces up to 14 years in prison on federal charges of coercing a minor into illegal sexual activity at Park Tudor High School in Indianapolis, where he was a teacher and basketball coach. </p>\n\n<p>According to the criminal complaint, Cox at one point attempted to convince the student to lie to her parents in order to have sex with him at his home while his wife and kids were away.</p>\n\n<p>Cox began sending the girl photos of his penis last year, sometimes without prior warning, prosecutors said.
