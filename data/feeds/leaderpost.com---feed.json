The judge&nbsp;explained&nbsp;if he&#8217;s representing himself, a&nbsp;trial date can&#8217;t be set&nbsp;until he gets disclosure of&nbsp;the Crown&#8217;s evidence. And if he&#8217;ll have a lawyer, then that person&nbsp;will have input in&nbsp;the trial date.</p>\n<p>George opted for an&nbsp;initial meeting with Legal Aid duty counsel&nbsp;\u2014 a resource offered to anyone making a first appearance in DVC&nbsp;regardless of income. The charge was adjourned to&nbsp;May 26.</p>\n<p>George&nbsp;politely declined&nbsp;to make&nbsp;any comment when approached after court.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to a police news release, the charge was laid when&nbsp;officers went to&nbsp;a residence shortly after 2 p.m. on April 28.&nbsp;A&nbsp;33-year-old woman&nbsp;&#8220;indicated that there had been an argument between herself and her partner,&#8221; said police.&nbsp;It&#8217;s alleged the complainant&nbsp;was grabbed by the throat and pushed against a wall. She did&nbsp;not sustain any visible&nbsp;physical injuries, police said in a&nbsp;May 3 news release.</p>\n<p>That&nbsp;same day, the Riders&nbsp;announced George&#8217;s retirement&nbsp;as he focuses on &#8220;a personal issue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An eight-year CFL veteran, George joined the Riders in&nbsp;2011 as a defensive tackle.&nbsp;He&nbsp;was a West Division all-star in 2013 and 2014.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;charge comes just eight months after&nbsp;the CFL adopted a violence against women policy that included mandatory training on the issue.</p>\n<p>Sitting in DVC, George was likely fully immersed in some of those lessons. Before his case was called,&nbsp;he sat&nbsp;through nearly 20 cases.</p>\n<p>As a DVC co-ordinator announced at the outset, those who accept responsibility for their offence and&nbsp;are assessed as a&nbsp;suitable participant take part in weekly, anti-violence group sessions. If&nbsp;those are successfully completed, the offender is eligible for a lighter sentence.</p>\n<p>As George sat gripping his court documents and, at one point, fumbling his phone, several men stepped up in turn to report what they&#8217;ve learned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was just a terrible, terrible situation,&#8221; said a 25-year-old man who admitted pouring two litres of soda pop on his estranged girlfriend and pinning her under a mattress.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another man, who hit his partner when she threw out his crack pipe, admitted he got a lot out of the program, but never got to&nbsp;all the sessions&nbsp;\u2014 which is why he was an unsuccessful participant.</p>\n<p>One particularly pleased DVC participant&nbsp;gushed:&nbsp;&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been this happy in 10 years.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>\u2014 With files from Murray McCormick</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:bpacholik@postmedia.com\" target=\"_blank\">bpacholik@postmedia.com</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=leaderpost.com&#038;blog=98658683&#038;post=154736&#038;subd=postmedialeaderpost2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2016/05/regina-sk-may-12-2016-former-roughrider-defensive-end-tea.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2016/05/regina-sk-may-12-2016-former-roughrider-defensive-end-tea.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">051216-george05122016-01.JPG-227568894-george05122016-01-W.jpg</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f2e19b8fa868c331307bdf679d0b9546?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">bpacholik</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Business leaders share ideas at annual conference</title>\n\t\t<link>http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/business-leaders-share-ideas-at-annual-conference</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/business-leaders-share-ideas-at-annual-conference#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:26:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kerry Benjoe]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Local News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[AGT Foods]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Business]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[indigenous]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kitsaki Management Ltd.]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[La Ronge]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Prahda Mitchell]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Saskatchewan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tammy Cook-Searson]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://leaderpost.com/?p=154685</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[One organization is working to help grow the province's women entrepreneurs. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=leaderpost.com&#038;blog=98658683&#038;post=154685&#038;subd=postmedialeaderpost2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One organization is working to help grow the province&#8217;s women entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan (WES) kicked off its annual two-day business conference in Regina.</p>\n<p>Prabha Mitchell, CEO of&nbsp;WES, said this year&#8217;s theme is Building a Legacy &#8211; Accelerating Growth and Innovation, which influenced the organizers decision on who its keynote speakers would be this year.</p>\n<p>The keynote for Thursday is Tammy Cook-Searson from the Lac La Ronge Indian Band from northern Saskatchewan and as chief is also the president of the Kitsaki Management Limited Partnership.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She said there is a great story behind Kitsaki that other entrepreneurs and businesses needed to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s been a very strong business that has stayed its course through some very tough economic challenges and downturns,&#8221; said Mitchell. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very interesting business because of the very diverse income streams &nbsp;\u2014 from mining to utility projects to investments and portfolios and partnerships in the community. They have created a really viable and sustainable business model.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said Cook-Searson also has her own interesting story.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She is the first female chief of that band and she possesses a really rare combination of not only being a leader, a politician, a business person, a wife and mother, but I think she&#8217;s a great role model,&#8221; said Mitchell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then on Friday, Murad Al-Katib, President and CEO, AGT Foods and&nbsp;Ingredients Inc. to deliver the keynote address.</p>\n<p>Al-Katid&#8217;s company operates in five different continents and earns billions in revenue each year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very honoured to have him speaking about his journey,&#8221; said Mitchell.</p>\n<p>She hopes the keynotes will serve to inspire those all those in attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the great traits that (Cook-Searson and Al-Katib) have is absolute resilience and an unwavering commitment to succeed,&#8221; said Mitchell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although the event is put on by WES it is not limited to just women.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a conference where&nbsp;entrepreneurs come together and is a great networking opportunity,&#8221; said Mitchell. &#8220;There are panel discussions, keynote speakers, workshops so women and men are able to leave with some practical tips, tools, tactics and strategies about growing a business.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She said these types of events are needed because despite the fact that women-owned businesses&nbsp;contributed $148 billion to the&nbsp;economy they still face many obstacles, such as a lack of business training and management, lack of access to capital, lack of access to markets and a lack of role models and mentors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to work as a business community,&#8221; said Mitchell. &#8220;I think we need to work with our male entrepreneurs and we need to work with our governments, so that what we call the gender entrepreneurship gap can be closed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is Women Entrepreneurs Week&nbsp;in Saskatchewan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:kbenjoe@postmedia.com\">kbenjoe@postmedia.com</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=leaderpost.com&#038;blog=98658683&#038;post=154685&#038;subd=postmedialeaderpost2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/business-leaders-share-ideas-at-annual-conference/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2016/05/la-ronge-sask-april-22-2016-0430-news-la-ronge-lac-la-ron.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2016/05/la-ronge-sask-april-22-2016-0430-news-la-ronge-lac-la-ron.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">051216-La_Ronge_LDR068.JPG-227299286-La_Ronge_LDR068-W.jpg</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0e2b70a9146a778f33ac180fd1094068?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kerrybenjoe</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Riffel Royals walk to support Regina newcomers</title>\n\t\t<link>http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/riffel-royals-walk-to-support-regina-newcomers</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/riffel-royals-walk-to-support-regina-newcomers#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:18:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Johnson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Local News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Archdiocese of Regina]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Madeline Young]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Michael A.

Riffel students and staff&nbsp;donated over $5,000 to the Social Justice Department of the Archdiocese of Regina (SJDAR) in Support of Newcomers to Regina. They held their 20th annual Wellness Day and Charity Classic Walk on Thursday morning.</p>\n<p>Proceeds go toward basic needs and education of newcomers in Regina.</p>\n<p>Bitaruki, a part-time greeter at Wal-Mart, told his story&nbsp;during the school assembly, by video.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was at&nbsp;home one night in Congo in 2000 and my home was rushed by people I didn&#8217;t know. I was shot in the spinal chord,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Bitaruki explained the&nbsp;SJDAR helped him achieve refugee status&nbsp;in Canada. His three brothers in Uganda are currently trying to be sponsored.</p>\n<p>Brian Chapman, an English teacher,&nbsp;said they chose to donate to SJDAR&nbsp;because&nbsp;the&nbsp;high school is&nbsp;culturally diverse.</p>\n<p>Chapman&nbsp;pointed toward a world map in the school&#8217;s foyer littered with tacks.&nbsp;&#8220;If you look&nbsp;over there&nbsp;we have a&nbsp;board&nbsp;where people pin what country they\u2019re from. It&nbsp;brings home that so many people come from somewhere else in order to get to Canada,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Nearly 25,000 refugees resettled in Canada in 2014, according to a report by the Canadian&nbsp;minister of citizenship and immigration.</p>\n<p>Linda Perron, English teacher and chair of the event committee, said the empathy that students show is one of the best parts of the event. &#8220;We&nbsp;notice more and more in our community there are newcomers who are struggling and need help. And in order to build up our community, we thought we would build up the newcomers,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>Many students expressed their enthusiasm about the event.</p>\n<p>Madeline Young, a Grade 11 student, said, &#8220;I think the most important thing is it raises money so (newcomers)&nbsp;can feel welcome here in Canada. We\u2019re all very fortunate to be here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Students spent the afternoon&nbsp;at the Sportplex Fieldhouse and Lawson Aquatic Centre.&nbsp;Activities included spin class, track races and court sports.</p>\n<p>Brian Chapman said although the day had a multicultural theme, Wellness Day was about breaking out of traditional classroom roles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I just think (Wellness Day) not only reflects the needs of our school and community, but the whole world in a sense. We&#8217;re trying to drive that home to the students. Bring home a balance that you need everything in life to make a happy life &#8230;&nbsp;Mentally, physically and spiritually,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>Past charity recipients include the Allan Blair Cancer Clinic, Children&#8217;s Health Foundation, Teddy Bear&#8217;s Anonymous and Special Olympics Saskatchewan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:aljohnson@postmedia.com\">aljohnson@postmedia.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/alexJschool\">@alexJschool</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=leaderpost.com&#038;blog=98658683&#038;post=154616&#038;subd=postmedialeaderpost2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/riffel-royals-walk-to-support-regina-newcomers/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2016/05/regina-sask-may-12-2016-riffel-high-school-student.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2016/05/regina-sask-may-12-2016-riffel-high-school-student.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">051216-riffel051216-2.JPG-0513_Riffle_Walk-W.jpg</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/268c9aeefe549780bd38bb9775c0f601?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">alexjohnsonpostmedia</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Riders reveal new uniforms</title>\n\t\t<link>http://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-reveal-new-jerseys-for-2016-cfl-season</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-reveal-new-jerseys-for-2016-cfl-season#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:13:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Murray McCormick]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Saskatchewan Roughriders]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Football]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Brendon LaBatte]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Football League]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Capicciotti]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Matt Webster]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Spencer Moore]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://leaderpost.com/?p=152873</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Roughriders unveiled their new uniforms for the 2016 CFL season during a media conference at Mosaic Stadium on Thursday.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=leaderpost.com&#038;blog=98658683&#038;post=152873&#038;subd=postmedialeaderpost2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Saskatchewan Roughriders have unveiled a new look for their farewell season at old Mosaic Stadium.</p>\n<p>The Riders revealed their revamped home and away CFL uniforms on Thursday during a media conference at Mosaic Stadium. The new adidas jerseys have been tweaked while retaining the Riders\u2019 traditional green and white colours.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe changes aren\u2019t too drastic, but it\u2019s something that is moving forward,\u2019\u2019 said Spencer Moore, who was one of four Riders modelling the new uniforms on Thursday. \u201cIt should take us nicely into the new stadium next year. It\u2019s a good look.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p>The 2016 season marks the final year the Riders will play at old Mosaic Stadium. The Riders are slated to move into the new Mosaic Stadium in 2017. The unveiling of the new uniforms Thursday was tied into the revamped logo that was revealed earlier this year and the move into their new home in 2017.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to change the logo and we wanted the logo to connect to the new stadium,\u2019\u2019 said Mark Habicht, the Riders&#8217; director of retail sales. \u201cWe knew that the new logo would go into the stadium this year and that was part of the change for the new logo. It made sense with the logo changing and all of those things. It\u2019s tied to the new direction we\u2019re going to, but we decided to launch it this year.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p>The new look is also connected to adidas taking over from Reebok as the official clothing supplier to all CFL teams.</p>\n<p>A change from previous jerseys is that the black trim has been removed from the jersey and the numbers to provide a cleaner appearance. The cleaner look has been enhanced with the removal of the logos from the back of the jerseys and the elimination of numbers on the shoulders.</p>\n<p>The pants feature four stripes on the left leg that represent each of the team\u2019s Grey Cup championships.</p>\n<p>\u201cFour isn\u2019t enough,\u2019\u2019 said veteran guard Brendon LaBatte. \u201cIt signifies we have work to do to fill up the leg.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p>The name &#8220;Saskatchewan&#8221; has been increased in size on the front of the jerseys. The new CFL logo has&nbsp;been added to the front and the updated Roughriders logo now appears on the shoulders.</p>\n<p>The size of the logo has been increased on the metallic green helmet. A&nbsp;liquid metal background adds to the logo\u2019s depth.</p>\n<p>The uniforms can be worn in multiple combinations when paired with the green and white pants. The home uniforms are expected to feature green jerseys and pants.</p>\n<p>Matt Webster and Justin Capicciotti were the Riders\u2019 other models for the new look. Webster likes the new uniforms and appreciated the fit of the pants and jerseys.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to feel like your jersey or your pants or your cleats or anything is holding you back,\u2019\u2019 Webster said. \u201cYou want everything to feel like it\u2019s part of your body and that\u2019s the sense that I\u2019m getting right now.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p>The new jerseys went on sale Thursday at Riders stores across the province.

He&nbsp;returned to Regina Youth Court&nbsp;on Thursday&nbsp;for sentencing.</p>\n<p>The teen cannot be named under provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.</p>\n<p>Crown prosecutor Drew Gillespie had requested a deferred custody sentence \u2014 roughly the youth equivalent of an adult conditional sentence, which allows an offender to serve a custody term in the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even though he didn&#8217;t make any threatening gestures, even though he was just attempting to show off in relation to the pellet gun, it instilled a lot of fear in the community at the school, in&nbsp;the parents involved and, I would suggest, even in the general community in Regina when a school has to be locked down in relation to a possible firearms incident,&#8221; Gillespie said.</p>\n<p>The teen had only one previous conviction on his record when, on Dec. 5, 2014, he approached&nbsp;two students at Balfour Collegiate and, lifting his shirt, revealed what the students&nbsp;took to be a handgun. When the students&nbsp;asked if the gun was real, the teen said he didn&#8217;t know before walking away.</p>\n<p>While the now-16-year-old didn&#8217;t make any threatening remarks or gestures, the other teens&nbsp;still went to the vice-principal, who called 9-1-1. Balfour was evacuated and neighbouring Miller Comprehensive Catholic High School&nbsp;secured&nbsp;while SWAT moved in to&nbsp;deal with the potential threat.</p>\n<p>By then, the teen had left. He was arrested later that day and told police where to find what turned out to be an inoperable pellet gun.</p>\n<p>After being caught out past his curfew and carrying a knife on June 12, 2015, the teen was back in trouble on Oct. 10 when he and another youth discharged the bear mace behind the Broadway United Church, not far from where a group of grieving teens was standing.</p>\n<p>Several teens \u2014 including one with asthma \u2014 had problems breathing and&nbsp;had to be taken to hospital.</p>\n<p>While defence lawyer Catherine Maloney said&nbsp;the discharge of the bear mace was an act of carelessness rather than intent,&nbsp;Gillespie said&nbsp;it nonetheless caused physical and emotional distress&nbsp;to a group of teens already struggling&nbsp;to cope with the sudden&nbsp;death&nbsp;of a friend.</p>\n<p>Maloney requested a probation order, speaking to her client&#8217;s troubled background, his &#8220;reduced level of maturity&#8221; and his lack of intent to cause harm to others in committing the offences.</p>\n<p>In the end, Judge Leslie Halliday agreed with Maloney&#8217;s position, opting to impose an 18-month probation term with numerous conditions intended to help the youth address his problems and risk factors.</p>\n<p>Even so, Halliday urged the teen to &#8220;internalize the consequences&#8221; of his actions and to work on bettering his situation in the future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:hpolischuk@postmedia.com\" target=\"_blank\">hpolischuk@postmedia.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/LPHeatherP\" target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/LPHeatherP</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=leaderpost.com&#038;blog=98658683&#038;post=154866&#038;subd=postmedialeaderpost2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2015/11/provincial-court-of-saskatchewan-in-downtown-regina-photogra7.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2015/11/provincial-court-of-saskatchewan-in-downtown-regina-photogra7.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">STOCK COURT PROVINCIAL</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b6f02a75835cffd0ff6f0e0654830757?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">hpolischuk</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Moose Jaw woman charged with impaired driving allegedly tried to flee scene on 3 wheels and assault police officer</title>\n\t\t<link>http://leaderpost.com/news/crime/moose-jaw-woman-facing-impaired-driving-charge-allegedly-trying-to-flee-scene-on-3-wheels-and-assault-police-officer</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 23:36:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Regina Leader-Post]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Crime]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Saskatchewan]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://leaderpost.com/?p=154699</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[After her&#160;vehicle collided with a guard rail on a bridge in Moose Jaw, a woman&#160;is accused of trying to drive away on three wheels and later assaulting a police officer.&#160; Moose Jaw Police members responded to the crash on the north side of the 4th Avenue Bridge at 3 a.m. on Thursday. &#160;The driver fled [&#8230;]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=leaderpost.com&#038;blog=98658683&#038;post=154699&#038;subd=postmedialeaderpost2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After her&nbsp;vehicle collided with a guard rail on a bridge in Moose Jaw, a woman&nbsp;is accused of trying to drive away on three wheels and later assaulting a police officer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moose Jaw Police members responded to the crash on the north side of the 4th Avenue Bridge at 3 a.m. on Thursday. &nbsp;The driver fled the scene after losing a tire and was stopped by police soon after.</p>\n<p>The woman driving the vehicle was arrested for refusal of a roadside screen device, impaired driving and breach&nbsp;of undertaking.

Ash said.</p>\n<p>Involved in the pilot are two hospitalists \u2014 doctors who primarily have hospital-based experience with backgrounds in family and emergency medicine.</p>\n<p>Prior to rounds, the hospitalists check reports that have come in overnight and each team member familiarizes themselves with each patient&#8217;s condition before discussing the next steps.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, the doctors will have reviewed any of the investigations that have come back for that day, but they also review the patient&#8217;s response to treatment,&#8221;&nbsp;said Dr. David&nbsp;McCutcheon, the region&#8217;s vice-president of physician and integrated health services.</p>\n<p>The hospitalist reviews each of the unit&#8217;s 35 patients three times throughout the day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the traditional model, the doctor makes rounds once a day in the morning and we rely upon communication through the chart as to what goes on,&#8221; McCutcheon said. &#8220;This is live communication so the doctor, the nurse, the pharmacist and whomever else are all together in one place at one time with the patient and the patient&#8217;s family member.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because rounds occur at a set time, physical therapists, occupational therapists and speech-language pathologists who work throughout the hospital know when to be on the ward to discuss their patients&#8217; treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is pushback from some family doctors not involved in the pilot, McCutcheon said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is a concern among some physicians that the hospitalists will be the focus of inpatient care over time and that they will be pushed out of inpatient care,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>McCutcheon added some general internal medicine physicians believe 4A patients are getting privileged care while they lack the same support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If this leads to better patient care, leads to better flow of patients through the hospital and if it&#8217;s more sustainable from a cost point of view &#8230; then people are going to have to move in the direction that the organization wants to take them,&#8221; McCutcheon said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the flip side, Ash noted patient and staff satisfaction has significantly increased.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Physicians and staff are making comments like, &#8216;This is what medicine is supposed to be&#8217; or &#8216;This is the work environment I always envisioned working in&#8217; &#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Because most of the care team is on the unit, if a patient&#8217;s condition deteriorates they can change treatment right away or move him to an intensive care unit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a traditional environment, when a nurse notices complications, she calls the doctor and waits for a call back. If the call is returned after the nurse is gone for the day, &#8220;you end up with some inherent delays built into the system,&#8221; Ash said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When patients receive more efficient care, they&#8217;re released from hospital sooner, which frees up beds for patients waiting in the ER for a bed on the unit.</p>\n<p>Not only are there time efficiencies, but during daily rounds the team checks for infections or other complications and immediately deal with them, McCutcheon said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The six-month pilot project began in late February. The region is implementing the program with existing resources and $305,000 in funding from the Ministry of Health&#8217;s Emergency Waits and Patient Flow initiative.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:pcowan@postmedia.com\">pcowan@postmedia.com</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=leaderpost.com&#038;blog=98658683&#038;post=154481&#038;subd=postmedialeaderpost2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/pilot-aims-to-improve-patient-safety-and-shorten-er-waits/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2016/05/regina-sk-may-12-2016-dr-ron-taylor-l-with-patient-ros.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2016/05/regina-sk-may-12-2016-dr-ron-taylor-l-with-patient-ros.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">051216-pasqua05122016-05.JPG-0513_safety-W.jpg</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/179c8dbc345053e8d5aa28f2dcfa5752?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">pamcowanleaderpost</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Youth learning how to overcome barriers to employment</title>\n\t\t<link>http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/youth-learning-how-to-overcome-barriers-to-employment</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 23:24:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kerry Benjoe]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Local News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jobs and Labor]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Regina Work Preparation Centre]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Service Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[youth]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://leaderpost.com/?p=154142</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Sometimes it's just not that easy to go out and get a job.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=leaderpost.com&#038;blog=98658683&#038;post=154142&#038;subd=postmedialeaderpost2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s just not that easy to go out and get a job.</p>\n<p>So, with the help of the Youth Employment Readiness Program (YERP) offered by the Regina Work Preparation Centre, eight students are learning to develop the skills they need to get that job \u2014 and to keep it.</p>\n<p>YERP is a seven-week program that includes three weeks in the classroom followed by a four-week job placement, which is funded by Service Canada&#8217;s Skills Link Program.</p>\n<p>Natasha Bellegarde-Kayseas, 27, is anxious to get back into the workforce and believes YERP will help make that happen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I came to this program in hopes that I will leave here with a job that will last,&#8221; said Bellegarde-Kayseas. &#8220;I want to learn more about the construction industry because that is something I am interested in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s been only week two into the program, she is amazed at what she&#8217;s learned, so far, when it comes to building her communication skills.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know what to say, but how to say it is what I have trouble with,&#8221; said Bellegarde-Kayseas. &#8220;They are actually teaching me better ways to get through an interview.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She is looking forward to starting her job placement with a local roofing company.</p>\n<p>Ideally, Bellegarde-Kayseas wants to regain her independence by finding a full-time job.</p>\n<p>YERP is for youth between the ages of 16 and 30, who are not in school or have recently graduated and are unemployed but interested in finding employment.</p>\n<p>Sheldon Delorme, 18, will soon graduate from Thom Collegiate.</p>\n<p>He finished the last of his high school requirements last semester, and was just at home when his parents told him about YERP.</p>\n<p>Delorme has no work experience and thought the program would not only help him build his resume, but help him be more confident when meeting new people and prospective employers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You learn a lot of useful information here that can help you find the kind of job you want,&#8221; said Delorme.</p>\n<p>Having to speak and work with others everyday has helped the normally shy Delorme build his confidence because he is less nervous.</p>\n<p>Cindy Leggott, YERP employment facilitator, said it&#8217;s amazing to see how far the youth have come in such a short time.</p>\n<p>Her teaching approach is first to make everyone feel comfortable and to let them know that they are all equals.</p>\n<p>Rather than desks, chairs are arranged in a circle and all classroom exercises have been designed to build their confidence and communication skills.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the classroom, I spend a lot of time giving them the life skills and crisis management skills that are needed to obtain employment,&#8221; said Leggott. &nbsp;&#8220;So we talk about everything from how to talk to employers right down to let&#8217;s make eye contact, let&#8217;s use proper body language, let&#8217;s talk about proper dress all the way to let&#8217;s build a proper resume.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She is confident the youth will do well in their job placements and if they do need help there are people at the centre who can support them</p>\n<p>The program runs continuously with the next intake stating June 20.

The man refused to comply with commands from police, and struggled when police tried to detain him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the officers deployed the Taser, and police were then able to get control of the man and safely take him into custody. The man was&nbsp;not injured in the incident. He is now facing two charges of assaulting a police officer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The use of the Taser has been documented, and will be reviewed by a use of force committee within the RPS.&nbsp;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=leaderpost.com&#038;blog=98658683&#038;post=154614&#038;subd=postmedialeaderpost2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2015/12/regina-sk-march-13-2014-sgt-derek-lamer-talks-about-th.jpeg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://wpmedia.leaderpost.com/2015/12/regina-sk-march-13-2014-sgt-derek-lamer-talks-about-th.jpeg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">123115-energyweapon031314-05.JPG-214912080-energyweapon031314-05-W.jpg</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/591be88c1a1798e99139bd187223d760?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">legacycontent</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
