At issue is the independence of the small but influential International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, which lobbies U.S. officials and testifies before Congress. The coalition recently admitted Alibaba as a member, prompting companies including Gucci America and Tiffany to quit. Critics consider the Chinese e-commerce giant the world's largest marketplace for fakes.
