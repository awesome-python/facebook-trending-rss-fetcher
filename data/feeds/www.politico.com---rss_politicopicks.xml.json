Trump tapped Paul Manafort, his D.C. fixer, and Ryan chose Kevin Seifert,  his political director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the big session was set to begin \u2014 after Trump and Ryan had met privately with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus \u2014 the New York billionaire suddenly allowed a flock of his campaign advisers inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Ryan invited in several of his own top hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapprochement between the GOP's presumed standard-bearer and its top elected official \u2014 assuming that's what this is \u2014 is clearly a work in progress. The two are on separate planets, ideologically and temperamentally, and one much-hyped morning summit was never going to produce some magical mind-meld. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now \u2014 after a get-together that was described by sources as pleasant, productive, even interesting \u2014 Trump and Ryan are  waltzing toward &amp;quot;unity,&amp;quot; or something approaching it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two teams are beginning a slate of policy discussions to explore their positions on key issues. They might not find agreement on some issues, but they hope they can lock arms on broad principles that will drive the election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan and Trump will meet again. And House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers  extended an invitation to Trump to speak to the entire House GOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump accepted, but a date hasn't been set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Ryan and Trump are beginning to move gingerly toward a political marriage neither of them chose, and it's not clear how or whether it will work. It's all but inevitable that, at some point in the next eight weeks, before the Republican convention in Cleveland in July that the speaker is slated to preside over, Ryan will, in some way, endorse Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dominoes are beginning to fall around Ryan. His two deputies \u2014 Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana \u2014 are both Trump supporters. Oregon Rep. Greg Walden \u2014 the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2014 backed Trump Thursday shortly after the Ryan-Trump confab ended. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has already given Trump his support, even if it wasn't exactly a full-throated endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Ryan and Trump will never truly be kindred spirits. Trump, not a master of minutiae, has turned Ryan\u2019s party on its head, blowing up long-held policy convictions and upending a political order that had been intact for decades. For his part, Ryan has spent the past two decades crawling to the top of that heap while becoming a master of arcane policy fights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the two can pull off the awkward dance they commenced Thursday over the next six months is still to be seen. But they're trying, at least publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cLook, it\u2019s no secret that Donald Trump and I had our differences \u2014 we talked about those differences today,\u201d Ryan said in the Capitol after his meetings with Trump. \u201cThe question is, 'What do we need to do to unify \u2026 the Republican Party?' \u2026 Can we unify around our common principals to offer the country a compelling and clear choice\u2026 to get us on a better track? And I am very encouraged we can put that together.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan added, \u201cThis is a first meeting. I was encouraged by this meeting, but this is a process. It takes time. You don\u2019t put this together in 45 minutes ... I want to make sure we truly understand each other. And again, I am very encouraged.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan\u2019s goal on Thursday  was to get Trump to understand what he \u2014 and, by extension House Republicans \u2014 care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speaker even brought charts and slides illustrating the nation\u2019s budget woes to help Trump understand the problem he has spent 20 years trying to solve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discussed abortion, the power of the presidency, federal regulations and Ryan\u2019s decades-long obsession: the nation\u2019s fiscal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they sat in the Republican National Committee\u2019s headquarters on Capitol Hill, with protesters yelling and music playing outside, Ryan spoke, and Trump mostly listened and nodded. The meeting was positive, according to multiple sources who were present, and Trump agreed \u2014 at least in principle \u2014 with all of what the House Republican leaders said. Each of the GOP leaders spoke and talked about their own priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He was very much in listening mode,&amp;quot; a Republican leadership aide said of Trump. &amp;quot;He was very pleasant, very nice. He mostly wanted to hear what we had to say.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also huddled with McConnell and members of the Senate Republican leadership, all of whom have publicly committed to supporting the New York businessman. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the first GOP senator to endorse Trump, also took part in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We had a very good meeting. Very good, constructive meeting,&amp;quot; McConnell told reporters. &amp;quot;We talked about a variety of things, both campaign related and issues.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 24 Senate Republican seats up this fall \u2014 compared with only 10 Democratic-held seats \u2014 there has been deep concern among GOP incumbents about fallout from a Trump-led ticket in November. Trump met privately with Ward Baker, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Sharon Soderstrom, McConnell's top aide, to discuss what he could to help in those races.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Republicans are trying to present a unified front, Democrats are trying to go on offense. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) bashed Trump and Ryan during a news conference, while Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) launched into what has become a daily tirade against the GOP's presumptive nominee, lambasting him for misogynistic comments made in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSince Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, you can only assume he agrees with Trump\u2019s view that women are dogs and pigs,&amp;quot; Reid said on the Senate floor. \u201cYou can only assume the Republican leader is not repulsed by Donald Trump\u2019s vulgar behavior towards women.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 20:06:23 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>jbresnahan@politico.com (John Bresnahan)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/paul-ryan-donald-trump-meeting-223125</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump to Senate GOP: I get your concerns</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-meets-senate-republicans-223118</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Republican senators that met with Donald Trump on Thursday were united by a shared concern: Trump\u2019s tone and rhetoric. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several lawmakers gently told him that what he says and how he says it matters, both for Trump\u2019s general election campaign and their own chances of keeping the Senate. Trump was in \u201clistening mode,\u201d attendees at the meeting told POLITICO, but gave them the answer that they wanted to hear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cI get that,\u201d Trump told the nearly dozen senators in attendance. Most of them were relieved to hear it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump also told senators that he would help raise money in the battle to retain the Senate, which further buoyed Republicans worried about whether he will be a down-ballot drag. In other words, it was a major step forward for the divided party, senators said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cHe was very, very congenial, very straightforward, very open to questions, criticisms and so forth,\u201d Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said. \u201cHe was terrific. I\u2019ll tell you, I was really quite impressed.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump and key aides huddled with Senate GOP leaders and party officials on Thursday morning to discuss coordinating the Senate and presidential campaigns as well as policy matters. For many senators, it was their first lengthy face-to-face meeting with their nominee, and they came away more confident that Trump will help them keep the Senate \u2014 not lose it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cObviously he\u2019s never run for public office before and so this is a new experience for him and for us,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. \u201cHe recognized the impact of the presidential candidate on down-ballot races and said he looked forward to being helpful when he could.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning Trump \u2014 accompanied by convention manager Paul Manafort and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2014 met privately with Ward Baker, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Sharon Soderstrom, chief of staff for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), according to a GOP source. The topic at hand was how the two sides could work together this campaign season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McConnell and his leadership team then huddled with Trump, who left at around 12:45 p.m. with a wave at the press mob. There was no media availability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We had a very good meeting. Very good, constructive meeting,&amp;quot; McConnell told reporters. &amp;quot;We talked about a variety of things, both campaign related and issues.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GOP leaders then gave a quick presentation to the full 54-member Republican caucus at lunch, informing them that in their view, Trump seemed interested in working with them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meeting between senators and the GOP nominee, lawmakers mixed policy with politics as Trump sat back and listened \u2014 one attendee said that Trump spoke less than half the time during the meeting with senators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was better than expected \u2026 he was not just listening he was responding,\u201d said one attendee. \u201cIt was not antagonistic. It was positive. There was a discussion of differences of some issues.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the Senate Republicans who attended the meeting also took turns taking a photo with Trump, with the presumptive nominee giving a thumbs-up in all the pictures, another source familiar with the meeting said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cornyn encouraged Trump to attend the Texas Republican Convention this weekend, though Trump's handlers shook their heads &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; as Trump expressed interest in taking Cornyn's advice. The Texas senator also offered to be an adviser in attracting the Latino vote after winning reelection in Texas in 2014 \u2014 an overture that reflects many Republicans\u2019 concerns with his statements that many people that come over the southern border are \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cmurderers.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Trump is even reaching out to his harshest critics. After Trump requested his national security expertise, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he spoke to Trump on Wednesday, even though he still won\u2019t vote for the business mogul. The conversation was \u201cvery cordial, funny,\u201d Graham said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cHe\u2019s got a great sense of humor. He\u2019s from New York, he obviously can take a punch,\u201d Graham told reporters. \u201cI wished him well and that\u2019s where we are.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) set the tone early on Thursday, issuing a diplomatic joint statement with Trump after their morning meeting. And Republican senators stayed on message as well, praising the sit-down and offering generalities about working together with a nominee who's at odds with party leaders' views on trade, Planned Parenthood, health care and foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants in the meeting talked about &amp;quot;all sorts of things. It was a good meeting,&amp;quot; said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Republican senators who attended the meeting: McConnell; Cornyn; Conference Chairman John Thune of South Dakota; Policy Chairman John Barrasso of Wyoming; Conference Vice-Chair Roy Blunt of Missouri; NRSC Chair Roger Wicker of Mississippi; Senate President Pro Tem Hatch; Rob Portman of Ohio;  Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia; and Fischer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Portman, Capito and Fischer are three of McConnell's four counsels to leadership. The fourth, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, was not invited to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the only Republican senator to endorse Trump while the primary was still being contested, also attended the meeting. He declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:10:11 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>skim@politico.com (Seung Min Kim)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-meets-senate-republicans-223118</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Top Trump ally on Capitol Hill: He snubbed us</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/duncan-hunter-trump-snub-223126</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of Donald Trump's top allies in Congress slammed the presumptive GOP nominee after he failed to meet with rank-and-file lawmakers backing his campaign during his ballyhooed trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) told POLITICO that Trump refused multiple requests to meet with members of Congress working to round up support for him in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI think it would have been good of him&amp;quot; to meet with &amp;quot;the first endorsers,&amp;quot; Hunter said, as well as those who've gotten on board more recently, Hunter said. \u201cThere is no reason not to have as many people on your side as you can \u2026 and he missed a real opportunity here.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump met with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and several others in leadership during a series of meetings on Thursday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His most ardent congressional backers, however, asked his campaign several times for a few minutes with the candidate, too. They thought it would energize the team running traps to whip support for him in Washington. They also wanted Trump to meet with a core group of committee chairs they thought would make for powerful future allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter said the complaint isn't about his ego, contending that face time with rank-and-file lawmakers would actually have helped Trump in the long run by making it easier for them to vouch for the candidate with voters in their districts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf they endorse him, then go back to their districts to say they\u2019ve met him and he\u2019s not crazy, it goes a long way,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt helps if you can say, 'I met the guy' ... and can be beneficial for Trump, too.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An aide to another Republican lawmaker backing Trump, however, called Hunter's criticism a bit much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These concerns about access are overblown. The early endorsers have had a number of opportunities to meet and talk with Donald Trump. Today\u2019s meetings with Speaker Ryan and the House Leadership are direct outgrowth of those discussions,&amp;quot; the aide said. &amp;quot;It is expected that Mr. Trump will be in Washington a great deal in the weeks ahead, providing new opportunities for members to continue their dialogue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:33:27 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>rbade@politico.com (Rachael Bade)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/duncan-hunter-trump-snub-223126</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>'Never (Again) Trump' sets sights on 2020</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/republican-primary-rules-donald-trump-223136</link>\n      <description>Grass-roots conservatives and party leadership are finding a common cause: Limiting Republican primaries to registered Republican voters.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conservatives, still reeling over the looming nomination of Donald Trump, are pushing new Republican primary rules that might have prevented the mogul\u2019s victory in the first place: shutting out independents and Democrats from helping to pick the GOP nominee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/16/why-trump-wins-open-primaries-maybe.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;romped&lt;/a&gt; in \u201copen primaries\u201d where non-Republicans voted by the thousands and may have influenced the outcome \u2014 especially in early states that set the tone of the entire race. Trump\u2019s most successful rival, Ted Cruz, thrived in states with closed primaries where only Republicans were permitted to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Cruz\u2019s allies \u2014 hundreds of supportive convention delegates that he helped elect \u2014 hope to use the national convention in Cleveland to shove states toward closing their open primaries. And if they\u2019re successful, it will not only go a long way toward warding off a Trump-like candidacy, it will tilt the primary toward conservative candidates in 2020 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advocates are finding a sympathetic ear at the very top of the party. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has long supported closed primaries, but has never had a constituency to back him on it. &amp;quot;I believe that only Republicans should vote in Republican primaries,&amp;quot; he said Friday at a Politico Playbook breakfast event, though he added that he respects the right of states to set their own primary rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the conservatives, Trump\u2019s path through the Republican primary is proof that the system needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe now have a progressive, Trojan horse candidate that manipulated the open primary process to hijack the GOP nomination,\u201d said Kendal Unruh, a Colorado GOP activist, said of Trump. Unruh will sit on the Convention Rules Committee, the panel that will set the terms for the 2020 presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruz himself is at the forefront of the effort, and he has continued pleading with his delegates to battle their way to the convention and commandeer the rulemaking process that will govern both the July convention and the 2020 presidential election process. In a conference call with his delegates Monday night, Cruz and top campaign adviser Ken Cuccinelli urged them to fight for rules that enhance the power of the party\u2019s grass roots. Choking off Democratic and independent influence from primaries is one way to do that, said Unruh, who was on the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe still have a job to do,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unruh isn\u2019t alone. Her fellow Rules Committee member from Colorado, Guy Short, ripped open primaries as antithetical to GOP interests. \u201cI think we need to start punishing states that have open primaries,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a Republican, then you can wait for the general. Democrats shouldn\u2019t have a role in choosing our nominee.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, these arguments have hit resistance from GOP elders and the party insiders who controlled the rulemaking process at conventions past. Closed primaries, they say, are self-defeating; shutting out non-Republicans shrinks the pool of engaged voters and limits the party\u2019s ability to attract new support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cruz\u2019s unrivaled organizing and lengthy candidacy helped him recruit hundreds of supportive delegates, and that could upend the calculus and predictability of the process this year. Many are still sore over Trump\u2019s win and wouldn\u2019t mind crossing the presumptive GOP nominee, who now views himself as the leader of the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t believe they would be concerned that it would be a slap at Donald Trump,\u201d said one Republican delegate to Cleveland, who also served on the Convention Rules Committee in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A move toward closed primaries would dramatically shift the way the Republican Party chooses its leader. Most states have open primaries or hybrid systems \u2014 from permitting crossover voting, to allowing voters to register on-site, while some have no party-based registration at all. Only about a dozen states have closed GOP primaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opponents of open primaries are particularly concerned about their prevalence early in the nominating calendar. After losing Iowa\u2019s caucuses, which are only open to registered Republicans, Trump beat rivals in New Hampshire and South Carolina, where Democrats and independents are permitted to cast \u201ccrossover\u201d votes. Those victories branded Trump as the candidate to beat and knocked out several other candidates, including Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina and Jeb Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opponents of open primaries are floating a variety of proposals that would shift the balance of power toward states that restrict participation to Republicans. One, which failed at the 2012 convention, would reward closed-primary states with extra convention delegates, enhancing their power over the presidential nominating process. Another would force more closed-primary states to the front of the GOP nominating calendar, ensuring that the early leader of the contest has more GOP buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of closed primaries say it\u2019s only logical that Republicans get to choose the Republican presidential nominee. Oklahoma GOP Chairwoman Pam Pollard, whose state held the first closed contest of the primary season this year, said open primaries are like inviting the opposing football team to choose your team\u2019s quarterback. Pollard, as a party chair, will be an automatic delegate to the national convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some say, however, that the decision should be left to the states, rather than set via a national standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWherever possible, power should flow from the bottom up rather than the top down,\u201d said Morton Blackwell, a Virginia delegate and veteran RNC committeeman. Blackwell supports closed primaries and is pushing for one in Virginia, but he would oppose any effort to force all states to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the convention Rules Committee debated a proposal that was even less radical: rewarding states that choose to hold closed primaries with a 10 percent increase in delegates. But that effort, too, was shot down as too coercive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIsn\u2019t one of our goals of the party to increase our voter registration?\u201d Kurt Criss, Nevada\u2019s Rules Committee member in 2012, argued at the time. \u201cBut where do we think these voters come from? They come from other parties.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Barbour, Mississippi\u2019s RNC committeeman and a 2012 Rules Committee member, said at the time \u201cWe\u2019re a bottom-up party. And the last thing that we need is the national party trying to tell us \u2026 how we\u2019ve got to run our primaries.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the push for closed primaries fails in 2016, one factor may be the acute fear of appearing to cross Trump, whose dominance in open primaries was a storyline of the campaign. Though he had a handful of victories in closed contests \u2014 most notably Nevada\u2019s caucuses, as well as primaries in Arizona and New York \u2014 open primaries were where he thrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI probably would not advocate for it at this convention,\u201d said Pollard, the Oklahoma GOP chairwoman, a staunch supporter of closed primaries. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to think that this issue has anything to do with Trump versus Cruz versus Rubio or anybody else. Things are so sensitive right now.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollard added that she hopes the RNC considers rule changes after the convention, when Trump is almost certain to be the official nominee and passions among his Republican opponents may subside. She argues that the ability of the rapid-fire news cycle to winnow the GOP field after just a few early-state contests makes it more pressing than ever to push closed primary states to the front of the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cForty percent of our candidates dropped out by the fifth primary,\u201d she said. \u201cAs Republicans, we do strongly believe in states\u2019 rights. But I think you also need to look at the overall consequences of some of our rules.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:03:21 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>kcheney@politico.com (Kyle Cheney)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/republican-primary-rules-donald-trump-223136</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump and the Artifice of the Deal</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888</link>\n      <description>How an old hotel covered with glass, underwritten by his father, became the Donald\u2019s first big success as a \u201cself-made\u201d man.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On the evening of April 14, Donald Trump put on a tuxedo and delivered an unusually restrained speech at the annual fundraising gala of the New York state Republican Party. Though the crucial New York primary was a week away, Trump decided he wouldn\u2019t bother using his allotted 30 minutes to pump his conservative credentials. \u201cPolitics gets a little boring,\u201d he told the crowd of 300 political dignitaries. What he wanted to talk about was a building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly for him, the party had booked its event at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, which happens to be the very first building Trump developed, about 40 years ago. So Trump told the story of the hotel they sat in, of&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the deal that would form the foundation of his real estate empire. \u201cIt turned out,\u201d he told the audience, more than once, \u201cto be a great, great, success as a hotel.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, in New York, real estate &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; politics. And few real estate deals in New York history were as laden with back-room negotiations as the one that permitted the renovation of a hulking commuter hotel into a luxe four-star affair. Wedged between the Beaux Arts Grand Central Terminal and the art deco Chrysler Building, the Grand Hyatt&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;stands as a curious and very Trumpian amalgam: a turn-of-the-century brick building blanketed by sheets of mirrored, \u201880s-era glass. It could have been airlifted from Dallas.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\u201cWhen he wanted to glaze the building, I put up a big battle\u2014I was more interested in preserving the building,\u201d the project\u2019s architect, Ralph Steinglass, told me recently. \u201cTrump sold [Hyatt] on the fact that he would be able to refashion the building, really recreate it into a bright, shiny object.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point of Trump\u2019s speech at the Republican gala was not to tout the present state of the Grand Hyatt, which he no longer owns, but to buff the legend he peddles of himself as an underdog success story\u2014as a self-made tycoon who disproved the haters and remade the Manhattan skyline in his image. \u201cWhen I did the building, everybody said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, it can\u2019t be done, never gonna happen,'\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy father, who was in Brooklyn and Queens \u2026 was so against me coming into Manhattan. And then this became so successful, and he said, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth, Fred C. Trump wasn\u2019t an obstacle to the deal. He was the main reason the deal got done at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred Trump has surfaced periodically as a point of political contention. Donald\u2019s erstwhile Republican opponents accused him of inheriting upward of $200 million. This overinflated figure is about as misleading as Trump\u2019s claim that all he ever received from dad was a \u201csmall\u201d million-dollar loan. In determining Fred Trump\u2019s influence on his son\u2019s success, though, the exact numerical figure is at best a distraction. The Grand Hyatt represented Donald\u2019s entry into Manhattan, and to pull it off, Donald relied not only on his father\u2019s cash, but his connections\u2014and this is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a Trumpian exaggeration\u2014to  some of the most powerful politicians, lawyers and bankers in New York. A decade later, when Donald\u2019s boardwalk empire in Atlantic City&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;was underwater and the Grand Hyatt was looking un-Grand, Donald again needed Fred\u2019s resources to bail him out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inside story of the Grand Hyatt doesn\u2019t showcase the vaunted business sense Trump credits with leading him to the threshold of the GOP presidential nomination. Rather, it reveals the crucial role Fred Trump played in getting his son\u2019s career off the ground, and keeping it airborne. Without Fred\u2019s help, there would be no Hyatt. And without the Hyatt, there would be no Trump Tower, no casinos, no golf courses, no career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there was something mischievously &lt;i&gt;artful &lt;/i&gt;about Donald\u2019s Grand Hyatt coup, in which a 30-year-old aspiring playboy kick-started his entire career without a credit line or building to his name. When I asked Victor Palmieri, the financier who sold to Trump the old commuter hotel that would become the Grand Hyatt, which of the two men deserved the glory for the project, he laughed. \u201cHim or his dad?\u201d he asked. It doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s the point. \u201cThat\u2019s the art of the deal.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1971,&lt;/b&gt; 25-year-old Donald had moved out of Queens to a studio on 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 3rd Avenue and was growing restless in his role as a glorified rent-collector for his dad. \u201cI had to prove\u2014to the real estate community, to the press, to my father\u2014that I could deliver the goods,\u201d he wrote of his early ambitions, in &lt;i&gt;The Art of the Deal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That meant one thing. Doing a deal in Manhattan, the only borough high-profile enough to enable Trump to emerge from his father\u2019s shadow and ditch dad\u2019s longtime Coney Island offices. And yet, to pull off a large-scale big city deal and leave the provinces behind, he\u2019d need to rely upon the decades of carefully nurtured political influence that Fred Trump had acquired in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred Trump was a builder of middle-class, outer-borough homes, and nearly every major project he developed\u2014from single-family houses in East Flatbush to Trump Village in Coney Island\u2014was subsidized by tax dollars. Without the Federal Housing Authority, Trump family biographer Gwenda Blair wrote, \u201cFred Trump would have been running a supermarket.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred Trump\u2019s biggest contracts came from the federal government, but his political clout was more pronounced at home. He lunched with a downtown Brooklyn power-crowd known as the \u201cKnights of the Round Table\u201d and was a VIP at the Madison Democratic Club, the nerve-center of Brooklyn politics. Early on, he became close with legendary real estate lawyer and political fixer Bunny Lindenbaum, along with Lindenbaum\u2019s best friend, a machine pol named Abe Beame, who in 1974 would become mayor of New York. Both would prove instrumental in his son\u2019s early career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Fred Trump built goodwill outside of Brooklyn\u2019s Borough Hall by strategically spreading his cash and influence. He was a regular on the philanthropic circuit and held board seats at civic powerhouses like the Jamaica Hospital in Queens and the Brooklyn Borough Gas Company. By the time Donald had graduated from Wharton and entered the family business, Fred was also boosting the political fortunes of Brooklyn congressman and gubernatorial candidate Hugh Carey. In 1974, the year of the election, Fred Trump, his business, and his family &lt;a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/news/behind-the-seventies-era-deals-that-made-donald-trump-7380534\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;gave a combined $35,000 to Carey; more than anyone except Carey\u2019s brother, a wealthy oil magnate.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred Trump\u2019s timing was good. That same year, Donald set his sights on a shoddy, 2,000-room commuter hotel on 42&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; street called the Commodore. His plan was to buy the dated 1919 brick colossus and refurbish it into a shiny Hyatt Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young Donald was not an obvious business partner for the old money Pritzkers, who ran the Hyatt chain from their home base in Chicago. But Hyatt was one of the last major national chain without a New York City footprint. And the company\u2019s aesthetic\u2014in 1967 Atlanta\u2019s Hyatt Regency debuted the concept of the vertical atrium lobby\u2014jibed with Trump\u2019s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were just a few problems to resolve before groundbreaking. The neighborhood was in awful shape. The iconic Chrysler was in foreclosure, Grand Central needed major refurbishments and the Commodore\u2019s entire stretch of street played seedy rival to the porn playground several blocks west in Times Square. The building itself was about as unattractive a business proposition as one could imagine. Occupancy hovered around 50 percent. A wink-wink \u201cmassage parlor\u201d called Relaxation Plus occupied prime retail space on the second floor. If it weren\u2019t for an expensive union contract that mandated the employees be paid, the hotel almost certainly would have closed. The lobby was \u201cso dingy,\u201d Trump later wrote, it looked like \u201ca welfare hotel.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which helps explain, ironically, why Trump became interested in the first place. The place had become such a roach motel, its owners were desperate for someone to take it off their hands. \u201cWe were trying to find a way to deal with the Commodore, which was  becoming derelict and was involved in a big labor dispute with hotel employees,\u201d says Palmieri, the financier in charge of the assets of the Penn Central Railroad, which owned the hotel, and which itself was in bankruptcy. \u201cIt was a dire situation.\u201d Palmieri says Trump \u201cwas not the most agreeable personality I had every met.\u201d But he fit Palmieri\u2019s job description: \u201csomeone who was young, who was very knowledgeable about New York politics\u2014and particularly the politics governing zoning and tax abatements.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last piece was crucial. Banks, in the \u201cFord to City: Drop Dead\u201d era, were not forthcoming with loans. Especially not to developers with zero completed projects, and no serious cash to their names. In order to get any kind of financing, Trump would need major help from the government. Lucky for him, Abe Beame\u2019s machine, newly installed in City Hall, seemed all too happy to comply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 1973, needing the city\u2019s assistance with another property, Trump scheduled a meeting at City Hall that included his father and Beame. A few minutes into the meeting, according to Blair\u2019s biography, Beame put his arms around the Trumps and said, \u201cWhatever my friends Fred and Donald want in this town, they get.\u201d A similar dynamic was at work several months later, when Donald began agitating for the Commodore property. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired in part by Donald\u2019s ambitions, Beame and Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut\u2014another old friend of Fred Trump\u2019s\u2014pushed a bill in Albany that, conveniently, would have created 20-year tax abatements for commercial properties like the one Trump was trying to develop. When that bill stalled and ultimately died upstate, Donald Trump worked with a well-connected City Hall bureaucrat named Mike Bailkin to create an even more favorable deal for himself. Bailkin\u2019s ingenious idea was for the state-run Urban Development Corporation (UDC)\u2014created in the 1960s by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to develop racially integrated housing by fiat\u2014to buy the place from Trump for a nominal fee of a dollar, then lease it back to him tax-free for 40 years, saving him hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a city where nobody was building much of anything, granting an unprecedented tax abatement to a private developer\u2014no commercial property in New York had ever received one\u2014might have seemed like smart public policy. But the serious consideration New York\u2019s political firmament gave the deal suggests that Fred Trump\u2019s behind-the-scenes influence was at least as important a factor as any good governance. The Beame administration doubled as a \u201cpalace circle of real estate people,\u201d says former Manhattan City Councilman Henry Stern, one of the few who criticized the deal at the time. \u201cIt was clear that [the Trumps] had enormous clout.\u201d When I asked him why so few opposed the tax break, he replied that most of his City Council colleagues were \u201cpart of the Democratic machine\u201d and that the rest \u201cjust didn\u2019t care.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, by inheriting several of his father\u2019s best people\u2014longtime New York publicist Howard Rubenstein; Brooklyn lawyer Lindenbaum and his son Sandy, Lindenbaum\u2019s equal as a real estate savant\u2014inherited his father\u2019s credibility. And Donald certainly cultivated a handful of key contacts himself\u2014most notably Roy Cohn, the political fixer and notorious legal hit man for red-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy. Cohn represented the Trump Organization in a massive federal housing discrimination case, before helping broker the Hyatt deal with Beame, with whom he was also friendly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nothing could match the persuasive power of Fred in the flesh. In 1975, after talks about the tax deal started to get serious, another meeting was called at which both Mayor Beame and Fred Trump would personally appear. According to Wayne Barrett\u2019s exhaustive book &lt;i&gt;Trump: The Deals and the Downfall, &lt;/i&gt;Fred promised the group he would keep watch over the construction. More significantly, he pledged to \u201cprovide financial credibility.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Trump needed now was for the state\u2014through the UDC\u2014to greenlight the deal. Once again, he leaned on his father\u2019s connections. Donald Trump had recently hired as his political&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;point person a woman the Trumps would have been familiar with\u2014Governor Carey\u2019s chief fundraiser, Louise Sunshine. In the mid-1970s, the UDC was helmed by Richard Ravitch, the New York City real estate stalwart whose family company helped build Trump Village. In theory, Ravitch should have been well-disposed to The Donald. In practice, he wasn\u2019t. Ravitch told me that one morning he received a phone call from Sunshine, whose child attended the same preschool as his. She wanted to know if she could bring in Trump for a meeting. He agreed, and Trump pitched his plan. It went badly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ravitch was already irked that Sunshine, a Democratic fundraiser and state party official, was lobbying on behalf of a private client. He didn\u2019t take kindly to Trump\u2019s bluster. \u201cHe wanted to buy the Commodore and wanted a tax exemption, and couldn\u2019t get the tax exemption,\u201d Ravitch recalls. \u201cI finally said, \u2018Look, it would be great to have a Hyatt Hotel. I would be willing to subordinate the taxes to the mortgage. And he said, \u2018No, I want an exemption. If you don\u2019t give it to me, I\u2019ll have you fired.\u201d Ravitch booted them both from his office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ravitch did not, in fact, get fired. Even with his father\u2019s pull, Trump didn\u2019t have that&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;much juice. But Ravitch was getting heavy pressure from Beame and his team to OK the deal. \u201c\u2018Look, here was the city on the balls of its ass in the fall of 1975,\u201d he remembers telling economic development czar John Zuccotti in a tense argument. \u201cAnd here was this brash kid who wanted to take the Commodore hotel and turn it into a Hyatt.\u201d According to Barrett\u2019s biography, Ravitch eventually caved and voted in favor of the deal. (Ravitch claims he doesn\u2019t remember this.) When a reporter asked Trump why the city handed him a 40-year abatement, he replied, \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t ask for 50.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1976, the $4-million-a-year abatement (it would grow progressively more valuable) was his. But even once he got the tax break, Trump still needed actual money to buy and renovate the thing. His financial broker went hunting for lenders on Wall Street and had come up empty. Fred Trump, once again, wound up doing the heavy lifting. There was of course the famous million-dollar loan. But there was also Fred\u2019s decades-old contact at Equitable Life Insurance, whose support Barrett &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Greatest-Earth-Downfall-Reinvention-ebook/dp/B01ECUXPIM\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; was key to the firm\u2019s decision to help finance the project. And it was Fred Trump and Hyatt chief Jay Pritzker, not Donald, who guaranteed the project\u2019s $70 million construction loan. (Donald and the Pritzkers would co-own the hotel.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the project ran over budget in the run-up to its 1980 opening, according to Gwenda Blair\u2019s biography, it was Fred who persuaded his pals at Chase Bank&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to give Donald a $35 million line of credit and a second mortgage worth $30 million. \u201cWhen it counted, which was when they went for the financing,\u201d says Palmieri, \u201chis father turned up to be on the loans, which was really the vital part of the whole deal.\u201d Donald may have conceived of the deal, but when it came to closing it, Ralph Steinglass told me, Donald \u201chad very little to do with pulling it off.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once ground was broken on the Hyatt, though, it was quite clearly Donald\u2019s baby. Fred Trump is still a household name in Coney Island thanks to his drab, sturdy, middle-class high-rises. Donald, with an arriviste\u2019s taste for silk suits and patent leather shoes, brought his mania for appearance to bear on the project. He had married the former Ivana Zelnickova Winklmayr in 1977, a year before construction began, and promptly installed her as a sort of foreman/interior designer hybrid. \u201cHer taste was similar to Donald\u2019s (\u201cbrassy, flashy\u201d) but she was actually more aggressive than he was,\u201d Steinglass, then with Gruzen &amp;amp; Partners, recalls. \u201cShe inserted herself into the weekly owner\u2019s meeting and would be pushing back against the contractor. It wasn\u2019t fun.\u201d At the time, &lt;i&gt;New York &lt;/i&gt;magazine\u2019s&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Marie Brenner observed Ivana in heels, a dress and a hard-hat, sidestepping puddles of water and roaring at construction workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure that the Trumps produced was both ingenious and bizarre. The Hyatt was coated with a silvery, reflective glass that set it apart from the classic structures surrounding it, while simultaneously reflecting them back toward the street. Its most unique feature, for better or for worse, was the cantilevered bar/restaurant that bulged over 42&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Street. For all its innovations, though, the Hyatt is not a modern building but an old brick structure that Trump simply plastered with large glass panels. To make it seem taller, Trump redid the elevator buttons so guests' rooms begin on floor \u201c14\u201d rather than on floor 6, where they are actually situated. Trump even finagled a more chic Park Avenue address for the hotel, though, as he admitted during the speech in April, \u201cit really fronted on 42&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; street.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grand Hyatt, named for the train station next door, opened on a September night in 1980. At the ceremony, which heralded Trump\u2019s arrival as much as it did New York\u2019s 1980s comeback, leggy blonds bore trays of champagne and &lt;i&gt;escargots en brioche&lt;/i&gt;. Bronze-hued marble competed with bronze-mirrored columns. &lt;i&gt;Veau aux trois champignons&lt;/i&gt; was served, incongruously, on gold Mylar tablecloth. Ivana, according to Brenner\u2019s memorable account, sat by herself in a rhinestone-encrusted dress while Donald zipped around antically, unable to sit still. Roy Cohn was there, of course, as was Governor Carey, who had benefited from Fred Trump\u2019s campaign generosity and whose state agency had provided the key approval for the deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trumps\u2019 expensive taste\u2014 gold lion\u2019s head medallions hung above the ballroom entrance, not far from the obligatory waterfall, babbling in the atrium\u2014helped mask the lurking infrastructure problems that would come to plague the hotel.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\u201cIt was never a great building,\u201d Paul Goldberger, the former &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; architecture critic, says about the old Commodore shell. And Trump seemed unwilling to make it so. \u201cThe emphasis was on keeping the cost down, to the detriment of the quality of the project,\u201d says Steinglass, who told me the guest rooms generally paled in comparison with the glitz of the atrium. (Fred Trump, for what it\u2019s worth, could be seen during construction patrolling the work site, &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=PmrwtRTQ3fMC&amp;amp;pg=PA259&amp;amp;lpg=PA259&amp;amp;dq=whatever+my+friends+fred+and+donald+want+in+this+town+they+get&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=RLhfu28jbz&amp;amp;sig=KPWW2CT9NGxfOq268qgN0qtOko8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBwoOisMTMAhWMCMAKHQuGCC0Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=bucket&amp;amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;pouring water into paint buckets to save money&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the early 1990s, the hotel was betraying its cruddy Commodore roots. According to a 1991 inspection report that later surfaced in litigation between Trump and the Pritzkers, the hotel needed at least $24 million worth of repairs and renovations. A few typical excerpts from the report:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;\u201cOn floors 14 through 30 there is a tan carpet with a runner type pattern in brown and tan. There are many wrinkles, stains and open seams.\u201d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;\u201cA great deal of the bedding was sagging and in need of replacement\u201d &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;\u201c[sidewalk tiles] are dirty and worn in appearance\u2026there were also 22 squares that were mismatched.\u201d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1990, AAA downgraded the hotel in its industry rankings. Meanwhile, the Pritzker family alleged, Trump was refusing to pay for any of the upkeep. \u201cTrump was cutting corners left and right,\u201d says Goldberger. \u201cAnd the Pritzkers\u201d\u2014who had endowed a prestigious architecture prize in 1979\u2014\u201cwere increasingly becoming a well-known and prominent family with a great deal more money than Donald Trump, but with a desire to be taken seriously in other kinds of circles. They were less and less interested in being in partnership with Donald, who was both glitzy and down-market.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the problem was Trump\u2019s cratering casino empire. After a series of financial missteps connected to the bloated $1 billion, junk-bond-funded construction of the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump\u2019s third and largest Atlantic City property, Trump declared bankruptcy in 1991 on several casinos and the Plaza Hotel in New York, which he also then owned. His net worth plunged into the red. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1993, in the midst of their ongoing dispute over Trump\u2019s unpaid share of the growing maintenance bill for the Grand Hyatt, Donald sued the Pritzkers, alleging financial mismanagement. A year later, the Pritzkers sued back for $100 million. In their complaint, they alleged that Trump agreed in the late 1980s that repairs were necessary, before deciding they weren\u2019t because he was \u201cnot in a financial position\u201d to afford them. They were suing him for being broke, and, what\u2019s more, for purposely refusing to spiff up the hotel in order to extract financial concessions from them. Trump, for his part, found the whole ordeal unjust. \u201cWhen I was in my deepest problems,\u201d he &lt;a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-29/business/fi-39687_1_grand-hyatt\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time, \u201cthey came to me and said, \u2018We want to renovate the hotel,\u2019 instead of holding off a little.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ironic bookend to the saga, Trump managed to avert total financial collapse thanks, once again to Fred, who bought $3.5 million in chips from one of his son\u2019s casinos to help him make a bond payment, an illegal loan for which he had to pay a $30,000 fine. Eventually, Trump recovered, settled with the Pritzkers, and by 1995, had been bought out of the Grand Hyatt altogether. (The Pritzkers still own the hotel.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the night of Trump\u2019s speech in April, about 1,000 protesters lined sidewalks outside the hotel. But inside, Trump, who was appearing for the last time in the presence of his then-rivals Senator Ted Cruz and Governor John Kasich, drew a chummy reception from an audience that seven days later would help give him an overwhelming victory at the polls. Trump extolled his fellow New Yorkers for their \u201cstraight talk\u201d and their \u201cvalues\u201d as he sauntered through a series of anecdotes about his subsequent triumphs as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI built, you know, many other buildings across the city. I\u2019m just listing some of them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis was my first. This was my first: the Grand Hyatt Hotel.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left out of the history lesson was the part about the tax break and the credit line and the loan guarantee\u2014about how Fred Trump sealed the deal for his son. Straight talk, New York values or not, doesn\u2019t always make for a good story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:35:36 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Simon van Zuylen-Wood</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>The Trump-GOP feud lives on</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/the-trump-gop-feud-lives-on-223150</link>\n      <description>Pretty pictures aside, Trump and the party elite still have serious issues to settle.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was exactly the kind of scripted political photo-op that Donald Trump loves to disparage as phony, yet there he was, waving to a phalanx of photographers outside RNC headquarters, smiling and playing along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an hour, the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee sat face to face with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who just a week ago surprised Trump by declaring he couldn\u2019t yet support his candidacy. And soon after it was over, both men issued a statement expressing optimism about working together \u2013 Ryan saying he was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d and Trump calling it a \u201cgreat meeting.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those platitudes are window dressing, a temporary distraction from the still-real rift dividing the GOP\u2019s intellectual class personified by Ryan and the frustrated, blue-collar base that has anointed a billionaire populist as the party\u2019s new standard-bearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, while Trump, Ryan and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus have spent the last week trying to tell the country that there\u2019s nothing to see here, there is, in fact, still plenty to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s money and a joint fundraising agreement between the RNC and Trump\u2019s campaign that is still needs to be hammered out. It's likely the most pressing concern for both sides. Trump's ability to monopolize earned media enabled his campaign to succeed without a serious fundraising operation. His dominance of a wide GOP primary field and the unpredictability of the race has left many of the party's traditional donors on the sidelines and the RNC millions of dollars behind expectations. Now both sides are playing catch-up as they try to cobble together an agreement to match the joint fundraising agreement Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have established, which includes 32 states and can accept donations of up to $356,100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there\u2019s Cleveland and questions about Ryan\u2019s role as chairman of convention that the former reality TV star-turned-candidate is eager to control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, there are the real policy differences between the party\u2019s professional class and Trump, and questions about whether the nominee will adhere to positions elemental to the GOP platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Trump is looking to smooth over potential disagreements, his campaign brass is sounding far less conciliatory. Recognizing the daylight between some of the candidate's positions and the traditional GOP platform, Trump's inner circle believes that the nominee has earned the right to dictate the terms of the convention schedule, vendor contracts and party platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's the nominee's party,&amp;quot; one Trump campaign source said. &amp;quot;He gets to set the rules and if you don't like it, work harder next time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan and Trump will never be a natural match. One is a thoughtful policy wonk burdened with the responsibility of holding together a fractious coalition of conservatives. The other shrugs off policy minutiae, speaks in a popular, often incendiary vernacular and won the Republican primary by accentuating the intra-party divide and encouraging the base\u2019s general revulsion for establishment leaders. But their marriage is, at least for the moment, one of necessity\u2014for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTrump needs to quiet the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 crowd,\u201d said Bruce Haynes, a GOP strategist in Washington. \u201cRyan on the other hand needs straight tickets and a unified party to get every vote for every caucus member he can. The fewer split tickets the better.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan is certainly feeling some pressure as members of his caucus, including his two deputies, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Whip Steve Scalise, have thrown their support behind the presumptive nominee. Ryan\u2019s endorsement of Trump, many think, is only a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cRyan will do this in a thoughtful and deliberate way because that is who he is,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cBut the gravity pulling him there is very strong.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s campaign entered Thursday\u2019s conversation believing they have more leverage than the party\u2019s establishment figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat Reince and the mainstream media don't understand is that Trump is bigger than the Republican Party,\u201d said one Trump confidant. \u201cYou may lose a handful of elites on one end of the party, but they\u2019re more than made up for by new voters, donors. The Trump coalition is bigger than Republican Party.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Trump\u2019s present popularity is confounding for Ryan, he could be a historical footnote by year\u2019s end if he doesn\u2019t win the general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is crucial for both of them, but it\u2019s probably more crucial for Trump,\u201d said one former GOP leadership aide. \u201cRepublican House members are going to be able to run their own campaigns in their own districts; whereas it will be very difficult for Donald Trump to win in November without a unified party behind him.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan and Trump agreed to meet again in the coming weeks, ostensibly to continue to discuss policy issues that may allay Ryan\u2019s concerns about Trump\u2019s conformity to traditional conservative orthodoxies. But given Trump\u2019s hardline positions on immigration and his apparent malleability in other policy areas, which he views as part of an ongoing negotiation, the objective for Ryan will likely be to find common ground with Trump in broad if not nitty-gritty policy details. For instance, it may be enough for Trump and Ryan to agree on the overarching need for lower taxes and a smaller federal government without aligning completely on specific policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cable news networks carrying saturation coverage of Thursday\u2019s meeting\u2014it started Wednesday with a \u201ccountdown clock\u201d ticking away the seconds leading up to the summit and continued Thursday with live footage of Trump\u2019s plane leaving Washington\u2014both sides sought to give every appearance of warmth and an eagerness to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Trump mocked Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio\u2019s protestations that they remained good friends even amidst a growing rivalry as they competed for the nomination, as \u201cpolitical bullshit.\u201d But now that he\u2019s beaten those former rivals and effectively locked up the GOP nomination, he\u2019s suddenly a character in a similar charade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his meeting with Ryan, Trump met with Republican House and Senate members on the Hill, charming many of the lawmakers he\u2019s spent the last year disparaging. He spent most of the meeting listening to the lawmakers. After finishing up with roughly a dozen senators, he posed for a picture with every senator, smiling and holding a thumbs-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 03:34:15 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>estokols@politico.com (Eli Stokols)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/the-trump-gop-feud-lives-on-223150</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Facebook's Zuckerberg to meet with 'influential conservatives'</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/mark-zuckerberg-conservatives-facebook-news-223146</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to meet with influential conservatives to discuss concerns about the alleged suppression of right-leaning stories on the social media website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn the coming weeks, I'll also be inviting leading conservatives and people from across the political spectrum to talk with me about this and share their points of view,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a &lt;a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102830259184701?_rdr\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI want to have a direct conversation about what Facebook stands for and how we can be sure our platform stays as open as possible.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet mogul\u2019s post also addressed claims in a &lt;a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Gizmodo report&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook\u2019s \u201cTrending Topics\u201d section, which is curated by human editors, routinely discriminates against conservative news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis week, there was a report suggesting that Facebook contractors working on Trending Topics suppressed stories with conservative viewpoints. We take this report very seriously and are conducting a full investigation to ensure our teams upheld the integrity of this product,\u201d he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg continued that the company found \u201cno evidence\u201d that the report was true and vowed to correct errors if they arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Zuckerberg's post went online, Facebook's Vice President of Global&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Operations&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Justin Osofsky addressed how Trending Topics is put together, explaining in a &lt;a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/05/information-about-trending-topics/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that the topics suitable to appear in that section \u201care surfaced by our algorithms, not people.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis product also has a team of people who play an important role in making sure that what appears in Trending Topics is high-quality and useful,\u201d Osofsky added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Sen.

King Jr.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration on Friday will push its aggressive civil rights agenda one step further, sending a letter to schools across the country notifying them that transgender students must be permitted to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice and Education Departments will issue the letter, reaffirming the administration's position on the civil rights of all transgender students and defying conservative critics who\u2019ve filed multiple federal lawsuits \u2014 including in North Carolina \u2014 over the intensely debated issue. The letter will not carry force of law, but will declare sweeping protections for transgender students under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities. The letter, which &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obama-transgender-rights-schools-222922\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;POLITICO reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week was forthcoming, emphasizes that a student's gender identity will be considered that student's sex when it comes to enforcing federal law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus,&amp;quot; said Education Secretary John B. King Jr. \u201cThis guidance further clarifies what we\u2019ve said repeatedly \u2014 that gender identity is protected under Title IX. Educators want to do the right thing for students, and many have reached out to us for guidance on how to follow the law. We must ensure that our young people know that whoever they are or wherever they come from, they have the opportunity to get a great education in an environment free from discrimination, harassment and violence.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration\u2019s strong reaffirmation of its stance on civil rights law and transgender individuals is sure to stoke growing outrage across the country over what has become an explosive political issue, generating headlines daily in North Carolina and in several other states, where local school boards and lawmakers are grappling with how to accommodate transgender students and weighing inclusive or restrictive policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter includes a threat that the Obama administration has leveled against North Carolina in the standoff over the state's law blocking legal protections for gay and transgender individuals: If a state fails to comply with the administration's interpretation of the law, it runs the risk of being sued by the federal government and losing federal funding, particularly for education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transgender students have the right to access bathrooms and locker rooms and participate on athletic teams that correspond with their gender identity, the letter makes clear. A school can offer private changing areas when requested, but those changing areas must be made available to all students \u2014 transgender students can't be forced to use them, the letter says. When students (or their parents) tell a school they're transgender, the letter goes on to say, the school must treat the student consistent with his or her gender identity \u2014 even if school records indicate a different sex for them. And schools can't require that transgender students have a medical diagnosis, undergo any medical treatment or produce a birth certificate before they're treated in a way that aligns with their gender identity, according to the letter. And, the letter adds, schools must respond promptly to sexual harassment claims when it involves a student's gender identity or gender transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Republicans and conservative groups, such as the Christian nonprofit Alliance Defending Freedom, have opposed the Obama administration's stance on transgender rights, and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has lambasted the president for what he has called a federal overreach and a blatant disregard for student privacy and safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCrory and the Justice Department &lt;a href=\"https://www.politicopro.com/education/story/2016/05/north-carolina-sues-obama-administration-in-fight-over-law-blocking-lgbt-protections-111900\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;filed dueling lawsuits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in federal courts in North Carolina earlier this week over the controversial state law, known as House Bill 2, that forces transgender people to use bathrooms that correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Attorney General Loretta Lynch considers the issue an extension of the civil rights struggle that won blacks equal treatment under the law, and said earlier this week that North Carolina\u2019s law is \u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d drawing comparisons to the Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation in the South during the Civil Rights Era. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere is no room in our schools for discrimination of any kind, including discrimination against transgender students on the basis of their sex,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cThis guidance gives administrators, teachers and parents the tools they need to protect transgender students from peer harassment and to identify and address unjust school policies. I look forward to continuing our work with the Department of Education \u2014 and with schools across the country \u2014 to create classroom environments that are safe, nurturing and inclusive for all of our young people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alliance Defending Freedom, which operates on a $40 million annual budget and relies on private donors that it doesn\u2019t disclose, has pushed for restrictive policies through lawsuits and in school districts and states across the country \u2014 and is now suing the Obama administration in Illinois and in North Carolina over transgender rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration's guidance is meant to reinforce the administration\u2019s long-standing interpretation of the law, clarify parts of it and offer best practices. But it\u2019s also an historic development for civil rights in America and represents the type of action from the federal government that the LGBT community has wanted for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights specifically mentioned that transgender students are protected under Title IX when it issued guidance in April 2014 on school districts\u2019 obligations regarding sexual violence and harassment. But advocates have been clamoring for guidance specific to transgender students and Title IX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights at the Education Department, and Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, will write in a blog post Friday that they've &amp;quot;heard from a growing chorus of educators, parents, and students around the country about the need for guidance on how schools can successfully support transgender students and non-transgender students in compliance with federal civil rights laws.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration will also release a best practices guide, along with the letter and the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In fact, just this week, the National Association of Secondary School Principals &lt;a href=\"https://www.nassp.org/who-we-are/board-of-directors/position-statements/transgender-students?SSO=true\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;called for&lt;/a&gt; the Department to release guidance and best practices on creating an inclusive and respectful environment,&amp;quot; their blog post will say. &amp;quot;Schools want to do right by all of their students and have looked to us to provide clarity on steps they can take to ensure that every student is comfortable at their school, is in an environment free of discrimination, and has an opportunity to thrive.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 03:11:44 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>cemma@politico.com (Caitlin Emma)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obama-administration-title-ix-transgender-student-rights-223149</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump disavows ex-butler's Facebook posts about Obama</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-butler-obama-223138</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;EDITOR'S NOTE: The following article includes language that some may find offensive.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump's campaign is distancing itself from the real estate mogul's former butler, whose inflammatory statements \u2014 including talk about his desire for President Barack Obama to be killed \u2014 have caught the attention of the Secret Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest controversy to touch Trump's campaign kicked up on Thursday when Mother Jones &lt;a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/trump-butler-anthony-senecal-facebook-kill-obama\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Anthony Senecal, who also worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, has posted several times on Facebook about his wish for Obama to die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the comments came to light, Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement, &amp;quot;Tony Senecal has not worked at Mar-a-Lago for years, but nevertheless we totally and completely disavow the horrible statements made by him regarding the President.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the comments, Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback said, &amp;quot;The U.S. Secret Service is aware of this matter and will conduct the appropriate investigation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senecal, who worked at Mar-a-Lago for almost 60 years, gained national attention in March after being featured in a lengthy and generally flattering &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/us/politics/donald-trump-butler-mar-a-lago.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; in The New York Times.

She adds that the day-to-day work of diplomats often requires handling such data via ordinary computer and phone systems and discussing it in nonsecure facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Although the unauthorized release of FGI is presumed to cause harm to the national security-thereby qualifying as Confidential [level] classified information. Department officials of necessity routinely receive such information through unclassified channels,&amp;quot; Frifield wrote in the May 2 letter. &amp;quot;For example, diplomats engage in meetings with counterparts in open settings, have phone calls with foreign contacts over unsecure lines, and email with and about foreign counterparts via unclassified systems. Diplomats could not conduct diplomacy if doing so violated the law.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State's stance on the practical difficulties of diplomats doing their work while observing robust safeguards for the protection of sensitive information appears to have changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the waning months of the Clinton administration, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk had his security clearances suspended over claims he used unclassified laptops to prepare reports on diplomatic meetings and that he also used those computers on commercial air flights. At the time, the State Department &lt;a href=\"http://fas.org/sgp/news/2000/09/dos092500.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;dismissed claims&lt;/a&gt; by some diplomats that the imperatives of their jobs required a degree of flexibility in complying with security mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Some newspaper articles have appeared [saying] 'Everybody does this, it's impossible to do your job without it.' Well, first of all, I've made quite clear to reporters who have written that is not true as far as I'm concerned and as far as the department is concerned. And, second of all, we do have a lot of people in this building that do manage to do their work and follow security standards,&amp;quot; Amb. Richard Boucher, State's spokesman at the time, said. (Indyk's clearances eventually were restored.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One of the grounds for classifying things is information provided in confidence by a foreign government, where they expect it to be protected,&amp;quot; Boucher added. &amp;quot;It crimps your style and makes things more difficult.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the different thrust of Frifield's letter and State's comments in 2000, State spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said: &amp;quot;The State Department takes the protection of sensitive information seriously. Our letter to the Hill directly relates to the rules surrounding FGI today which have changed over time.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State's view on the issue now is clearly different than it was 16 years ago, one prominent expert on classified information said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think this latest letter is much more nuanced and seems much more realistic,&amp;quot; said Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. &amp;quot;Boucher\u2019s scenario is if you hear something at a meeting you have to not do anything about it until you get to a SCIF [sensitive compartmented information facility] and report it then. That's crazy. I think it was crazy at the time, but he was not prepare to acknowledge that diplomats could use unclassified media for their work. ... The latest letter is much more candid and realistic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last September, a former State Department official &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-gmail-google-classified-content-213458#ixzz48TtsIJWO \" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told POLITICO&lt;/a&gt; that whatever the rules may be read to require, the practical effect of treating all foreign government information as classified would bring operations at State and the National Security Council to a near standstill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The daily operations of State and, I would add, the White House, would not be possible if everyone put everything on the classified email system that involved foreign government information,\u201d said the former official, who asked not to be named. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me that every single conversation with a foreign government official is per force classified.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The over 2,000 messages now classified as confidential comprise the bulk of the tally of more than 2,100 messages on Clinton's account now considered classified. But the confidential messages are unlikely to be pivotal in the ongoing FBI investigation into Clinton's email set-up. Instead, investigators are believed to be focusing on 65 messages deemed &amp;quot;Secret&amp;quot; and 22 considered &amp;quot;Top Secret.&amp;quot; At least some of those are said to contain sensitive intelligence information gathered by U.S. government spy agencies, although the State Department has insisted it got some of the information independently from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frifield's new letter not only owns up to the widespread presence of foreign government information on State's unclassified systems, but goes on to argue that the department's regulations explicitly authorize that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Obama's 2009 executive order on classification &amp;quot;and the Foreign Affairs Manual acknowledge that FGI often can be maintained on systems that otherwise would be inappropriate for safeguarding Confidential information.' In other words, maintaining FGI on unclassified systems often does not amount to mishandling the information. It is not until FGI could be subject to public release that a determination needs to be made as to whether the release would result in damage to national security,&amp;quot; the State Department official wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frifield's letter cites a State policy that says: &amp;quot;When adequate to achieve the required protection, FGI may be handled under standards that are less restrictive than the safeguarding standards that ordinarily apply to U.S. 'Confidential' information, including modified handling and transmission and allowing access to individuals with a need-to-know who have not otherwise been cleared for access to classified information or executed an approved nondisclosure agreement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But another provision elsewhere in the same State manual appears to indicate that foreign government information conveyed in confidence should always be classified &amp;quot;Confidential.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Employees must handle foreign government information (FGI) in the following manner ... Classify foreign government information, other than NATO information, that is \u201cRestricted,\u201d \u201cDesignated,\u201d or \u201cunclassified provided in confidence\u201d as U.S. Confidential to protect it from unauthorized disclosure,&amp;quot; the policy says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the manual adds that such information should be marked &amp;quot;Confidential/Modified Handling&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;C/MOD&amp;quot; and can then be handled in unclassified channels. None of the Clinton emails now deemed classified appear to have that marking. Many of those sent to her were originally marked &amp;quot;unclassified.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A State Department official said &amp;quot;Confidental/Modified&amp;quot; markings are rare. &amp;quot;Marking a document FGI-Confidential Modified is done in very narrow and specific instances. For example, in the course of treaty negotiations in which the U.S. government needs to share sensitive information with a foreign counterpart,&amp;quot; said the official, who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frifield's letter also suggests that State often treats foreign government information as unclassified indefinitely and only designates it as classified if its public release is demanded under the Freedom of Information Act. She notes that several other government agencies have laws on the books that allow them to withhold unclassified information from foreign governments or international organizations. State &amp;quot;has been seeking&amp;quot; such legal authority for years, but Congress has not acted on that request, leaving State with no other way to protect foreign government information other than &amp;quot;upgrading&amp;quot; it to classified when requested,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frifield's letter, written in response to a March query from Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Thomas Carper of Delaware, was first &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/clinton-emails-routine-practice.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported on this week by The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.

Mitt Romney &lt;a href=\"http://politi.co/24Nd6RG\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;disagreed&lt;/a&gt;. And to come full circle, Trump said later Wednesday that he still &lt;a href=\"http://politi.co/1TR3hgk\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;hopes&lt;/a&gt; to release his returns before November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Thorndike of Tax Analysts, a historian on these matters, &lt;a href=\"http://cnnmon.ie/1Nr1UFZ\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;recounted&lt;/a&gt; to CNN how former President Richard Nixon released his tax returns in 1973 while under audit, undercutting Trump\u2019s claim that he needs to wait for the IRS to finish with its examination. (That\u2019s actually where Nixon\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not a crook\u201d line came from.) Also: Trump did release his returns under audit before, to Pennsylvania and New Jersey &lt;a href=\"http://cnn.it/1Ojt01Z\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;gambling officials&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, Justin Wolfers from The New York Times &lt;a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1Nr9aBM\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; what could be gleaned from Trump\u2019s returns: \u201cIf you don\u2019t release your returns, voters will infer that they\u2019re not the very best tax returns.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LET\u2019S PUSH THIS FORWARD: &lt;/b&gt;Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re dealing with a President Trump in the coming years, and his tax returns are once again under audit. Would there be any conflict there, given that Trump would be head of an executive branch that includes the Treasury Department and the IRS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a word: no. Both Thorndike and Dean Zerbe, a former top Senate Finance aide, told Morning Tax that the IRS already has a firewall in place to make sure there aren\u2019t issues if any president is audited. \u201cWhoever\u2019s at the White House would basically cut the telephone cord between the White House and the IRS,\u201d said Zerbe, now at alliantgroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, both Thorndike and Zerbe said there\u2019s every reason to believe that lots of presidents have already been audited. (In fact, the Internal Revenue Manual says both the president's and vice president\u2019s returns should be subject to \u201cmandatory examinations.\u201d) \u201cThere are quite a lot of audits that go on quite regularly on high-ranking officials,\u201d Thorndike said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final thought: Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, and her husband would also seem to be at heightened risk for an audit, given how wealthy they are. (The same would\u2019ve gone for Dick Cheney, John Kerry and other recent potential or actual presidents or vice presidents.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IT\u2019S THURSDAY, &lt;/b&gt;and also the 236th anniversary of the Continental Army\u2019s surrender of Charleston, S.C., to the British during the American Revolution.

Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, is readying some more tax reform drafts for public consumption to potentially lay the groundwork for action next year, according to Bloomberg BNA. One area to expect some movement: Wyden\u2019s looking at a proposal that would have some serious overlap with former House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp\u2019s 2013 draft on derivatives and other financial products, but would also incorporate some of the responses to Camp\u2019s draft, BNA reports. (Wyden\u2019s recent draft on depreciation took some inspiration from former Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus.) Also of note: Sen. Chuck Schumer, the next Democratic leader, said he hasn\u2019t talked with House Speaker Paul Ryan about international tax reform, but has chatted with Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady. &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/24Pw1id\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://bit.ly/24Pw1id&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NO, FOR REAL \u2014 WE WON\u2019T CALL YOU FIRST:&lt;/b&gt; Remember how the IRS, in its efforts against identity theft, would repeatedly warn taxpayers that they wouldn\u2019t make first contact over the phone to demand money? Well, apparently it was a bit of a different story when it came to audits. Tax Notes reports that people at a public taxpayer advocate forum last week complained that IRS employees called them to set up audits \u2014 which apparently confused the taxpayers because the IRS made such a big deal about not calling first. Now, the IRS \u2014 in what it calls \u201can abundance of caution\u201d due to all the phone scams \u2014 said taxpayers will always be told by letter if they\u2019ve been selected for an audit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said just a small percentage of first-audit contact came by phone for in-person field audits, and that \u201cwe have no indication that criminals claiming to represent the IRS on the phone have said they were calling to set up an appointment for a meeting.\u201d (H/T: Tax Notes\u2019 Luca Gattoni-Celli.) Full story here: &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/1T9aueQ\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://bit.ly/1T9aueQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MORE IRS: &lt;/b&gt;The agency sent out around $94 billion worth of returns, for about 29.2 million returns, by Feb. 12 this year, The Wall Street Journal reports. But next year, the IRS can\u2019t send any refunds out until Feb. 15 because of a new law taking aim at tax fraud, and tax preparers and consumer advocates say that\u2019s going to put the squeeze on low-income households. &lt;a href=\"http://on.wsj.com/1Nr3U16\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://on.wsj.com/1Nr3U16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A CARRIED INTEREST UPDATE: &lt;/b&gt;Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, both Treasury secretaries under former President Bill Clinton, told private equity executive David Rubenstein just how little they thought of the preferential treatment of carried interest during an interview in Las Vegas. Summers, according to Business Insider, gave Rubenstein \u201cbackhanded praise\u201d for lobbying to keep the tax break. \u201cRarely has a policy existed so long with such weak arguments in its favor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, and carried interest, right?&amp;quot; (Rubenstein argued that both Rubin and Summers could have gotten rid of the preference as Treasury secretary. Rubin suggested that Congress had to act.) &lt;a href=\"http://read.bi/1UUi6kJ\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://read.bi/1UUi6kJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BACK TO TRUMP: &lt;/b&gt;We decided to put a little space between our Trump coverage for the day. Our Brian Faler and Pro Budget Brief\u2019s Matthew Nussbaum examined how Sam Clovis, a top economic adviser to Trump, said the presumptive GOP nominee could pull off a budget surplus of $7 trillion at the end of a decade. Clovis also said the Tax Foundation \u2014 which really likes dynamic scoring \u2014 didn\u2019t dynamically score Trump\u2019s tax plan. Brian and Matt called Clovis\u2019 remarks \u201ca sometimes bewildering explanation of Trump's agenda.\u201d Or to put it more deadpan: \u201cClovis' estimates are implausible, and are likely to raise questions about the advice the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is getting on the economy.\u201d &lt;a href=\"https://www.politicopro.com/tax/story/2016/05/top-trump-aide-says-plans-will-generate-up-to-7-trillion-budget-surplus-112752\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://politico.pro/1WqVnyv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICO's Shane Goldmacher also has a follow-up on just what sort of changes Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore want to make to Trump\u2019s tax plan to reduce the revenue loss to $3.8 trillion \u2014 and it seems to go beyond mere tweaks, as Kudlow originally said. Alan Cole of the Tax Foundation said the plan would also cap itemized deductions, increase all the tax rates from Trump\u2019s original plan and dramatically reduce the number of people who wouldn\u2019t owe income taxes. &lt;a href=\"https://www.politicopro.com/tax/story/2016/05/economists-revising-trump-tax-plan-would-make-more-people-pay-taxes-112636\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://politico.pro/24NfJ63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PACK YOUR PARKA: &lt;/b&gt;The House Ways and Means tax policy subcommittee is bringing back an old favorite today \u2014 a member day inviting lawmakers to get about three minutes to discuss their legislation to improve the tax code.

At the same time, Panama and the British Virgin Islands, two of the more prominent tax havens in the world, won\u2019t be there. (Secretary of State John Kerry will.) The U.K.\u2019s transparency efforts include boosting information sharing among British dependencies, known to be hotbeds of offshore banking activity. &lt;a href=\"http://on.wsj.com/1TQWJyp\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://on.wsj.com/1TQWJyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RUSSIA FALLS SHORT: &lt;/b&gt;The Panama Papers \u2014 and the over 6,000 Russian companies and people named in the trove \u2014 show that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s efforts to crack down on offshoring is falling short, The Associated Press reports. &lt;a href=\"http://apne.ws/1sf2Q78\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://apne.ws/1sf2Q78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A NEW NAME: Australian &lt;/b&gt;Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was a director of an offshore company incorporated by Mossack Fonseca, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

Only 18 states and Washington, D.C., levy an estate tax, hitting 2.56 percent of estates in those places. \u201cEstate tax revenue supports services that make a state an attractive place to do business and live,\u201d CBPP\u2019s Elizabeth McNichol writes. \u201cResearch confirms that very few wealthy individuals move as a result of an estate tax.\u201d Opponents of the estate tax \u2014 who you\u2019d certainly have to say have the momentum \u2014 do in fact argue that the estate tax hurts economic growth.

I think that when you hear stories about us cracking down on whistleblowers or whatnot, we\u2019re talking about a really small sample,&amp;quot; Obama said in &lt;a href=\"http://www.dailytargum.com/article/2016/05/president-obama-sits-down-with-the-daily-targum\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;an interview published Thursday by the Rutgers University student newspaper, the Daily Targum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Many of the cases that are often lumped into, you know, my ledger, essentially were cases that were brought before we came into office. Some of them are serious, where you had purposeful leaks of information that could harm or threaten operations or individuals who were in the field involved with really sensitive national security issues,&amp;quot; the president added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whistleblower and First Amendment advocates have been sharply critical of Obama over the at-least eight prosecutions brought on his watch under the Espionage Act involving suspected leaks. Before Obama took office, only three such cases had been prosecuted since the law was put on the books almost a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's comment that &amp;quot;many of the cases&amp;quot; attributed to his administration were &amp;quot;brought&amp;quot; before he took office is not true in a literal sense. He appears to be echoing a talking point of Justice Department officials and others who've noted that some of the leak investigations that resulted in charges got underway before his team assumed power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A POLITICO review of eight cases charged under Obama indicates that three appear to have been under investigation during the Bush era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the interview, which was conducted Monday, Obama said he's a strong proponent of First Amendment freedoms, even if he's not always fond of how the media has covered him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The general approach that I have consistently advocated for is maximum freedom of the press. And what I\u2019ve found personally is that \u2014 although there are times (when) it can be frustrating for a president or an administration where you feel as if the way something is reported is not accurate or is sensationalized \u2014 it is greatly preferable to the alternative. And that is something that I think we have to continue to fight for and uphold,&amp;quot; the president said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One prominent lawyer for whistleblowers said it was hard to assess the pace of leak prosecutions under Obama as anything but a significant increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is not a really small sample. This is a tremendous uptick in whistleblower prosecutions,&amp;quot; said Jesselyn Radack of ExposeFacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radack also noted that, despite Obama's embrace of the First Amendment, prosecutors have not been willing to permit alleged leakers to mount a defense that they were performing a public service by disclosing important information to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many of the leak cases, &amp;quot;the government filed a motion to preclude any mention of the First Amendment,&amp;quot; she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama is set to speak at the Rutgers commencement on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:01:56 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>jgerstein@politico.com (Josh Gerstein)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/05/obama-defends-leak-prosecutions-first-amendment-223134</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Reid: McConnell must also think women are 'dogs'</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/harry-reid-mitch-mcconnell-women-223115</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ridiculed Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor Thursday for embracing Donald Trump as the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, saying the Kentucky senator must also think women are \u201cdogs and pigs.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid's feisty comments come as the real estate mogul is in Washington for a series of conclaves with House Speaker Paul Ryan, McConnell and other congressional and party leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s just the latest sign that Republican leaders in both houses are marching lock step with Donald Trump,\u201d Reid said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McConnell told reporters last week that he had \u201ccommitted to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters,\u201d noting that Trump \u201cis now on the verge of clinching the nomination.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI guess he should be giddy about a Trump presidency,\u201d Reid said Thursday. \u201cDonald Trump is everything that the Republican leader and his party could ever want in a nomination. Trump\u2019s policy positions are identical to the Republican Party platform, and today Sen. McConnell can discuss when they meet in an hour or two that consensus with Trump.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid continued tying the Senate leader to the billionaire, accusing both of being obstructionists when it comes to acting on President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee and anti-women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSince Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, we can only assume he agrees with Trump\u2019s view that women are dogs and pigs. We can only assume that the Republican leader is not repulsed by Donald Trump\u2019s vulgar behavior toward women,\u201d Reid said, pointing to an infamous interview Trump gave to Howard Stern as an example of how he views women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid added that Trump and McConnell can discuss their anti-immigration views, too. Trump has called Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d and vowed to build a wall on the southern border that Mexico will pay for. He also wants to deport some 11 million undocumented immigrants. He has, however, taken a step back from his proposal last year to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI assume that they can have a long discussion about the wall: how high it should be, how they\u2019re gonna get the Mexicans to pay for the wall, even though most people think the idea\u2019s insane,\u201d Reid said. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget, Republicans have demagogued Latinos and immigrants for decades. They\u2019re doing it today.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid derisively argued that Trump and McConnell will have plenty to talk about when they meet Thursday, including why the businessman should thank McConnell for his ascent to the top of the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cDonald Trump and the Republican leader should have a long, long conversation. They have a lot to talk about,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAt some point in their conversation, Donald Trump should thank the senior senator from Kentucky. Trump owes his candidacy to the Republican leader and to the policies he\u2019s led. It was an obstructionist, anti-woman, anti-Latino, anti-Muslim, anti-middle class, anti-environment and anti-Obama and anti-everything Republicans during the last eight years have made Donald Trump a reality.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:21:31 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>nmccaskill@politico.com (Nolan D.

And they decided to have more meetings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly anticipated summit Thursday between the top Republican elected official in the country and the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee produced a media frenzy, but yielded little in the way of tangible results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan, as expected, didn't endorse Trump. And it's clear major policy differences remain. But for now, the two are trying to display unity as they prepare for a fall battle with Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. With Republican control of the Senate on the line, as well as fears that Democrats could make big inroads into the House Republican majority \u2014 much less the battle for the White House itself \u2014 the stakes for both men are enormous. They need to find some means to cooperate, or at least appear amicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The United States cannot afford another four years of the Obama White House, which is what Hillary Clinton represents. That is why it\u2019s critical that Republicans unite around our shared principles, advance a conservative agenda, and do all we can to win this fall,&amp;quot; Trump and Ryan said in a joint statement following their hourlong meeting. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus hosted the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;While we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground. We will be having additional discussions, but remain confident there\u2019s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall, and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan and Trump added: &amp;quot;This was our first meeting, but it was a very positive step toward unification.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a news conference afterward, Ryan repeatedly ducked the question of whether he would formally back Trump, and if so, when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also made clear that he and Trump are still on different pages policy-wise, though he didn't get into details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=\"enhancement\" data-id=\"00000154-a5c7-da04-a3ff-bddfea5d0000\" data-reference=\"{&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Hill GOP horrified, awestruck by Trump\\r\\n&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;record&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;_ref&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;00000154-a5c7-da04-a3ff-bddfea5d0000&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0000014f-2902-d3ee-ab5f-ffef6efc0000&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;_id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;00000154-a5c8-dd11-affc-f7de137d0000&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff41570003&amp;quot;}\"&gt;Hill GOP horrified, awestruck by Trump&#13;\n&lt;/button&gt;&amp;quot;Look, it's no secret that Donald Trump and I have had our differences. We talked about those differences today. That's common knowledge,&amp;quot; Ryan told reporters.  &amp;quot;The question is what is it that we need to do to unify the Republican Party and all strains of conservative wings in the party. We had a very good and encouraging, productive conversation on how to do that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was very encouraged by what I heard from Donald Trump today,&amp;quot; Ryan added. &amp;quot;This is a process, it takes a little time. You don't put it together in 45 minutes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump took to his favorite medium, Twitter, to rave about his trip to Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Great day in D.C. with &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;@&lt;b&gt;SpeakerRyan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Republican leadership. Things working out really well! #Trump2016,&amp;quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan acknowledged that there are bitter divisions within the party, and the schisms aren't going to magically disappear overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The process of unifying the Republican Party, which just finished a primary about a week ago, perhaps one of the most divisive primaries in memory, takes some time,&amp;quot; Ryan said. &amp;quot;Look, there are people who were for Donald Trump, who were for Ted Cruz, for John Kasich, who were for Marco Rubio and everybody else, and it's very important that we don't fake unifying, we don't pretend unification.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Ryan has pointedly refused to endorse Trump so far \u2014 and has publicly challenged Trump several times over the former reality TV star's harsh rhetoric and controversial stances \u2014 Thursday's meeting was seen as a critical moment for the Wisconsin Republican, who has been widely talked about as a future presidential candidate himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would Ryan become a loyal member of Trump\u2019s Republican Party? Or would Ryan keep his distance from the bombastic GOP nominee, bucking much of the political establishment in an attempt to keep his brand intact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains clear that Ryan will never fully embrace the Republican Party\u2019s nominee, and is instead focused on his own policy agenda. Ryan will spend much of 2016 campaigning to keep the House majority and seek to avoid the daily back-and-forth of the presidential race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan, though, has found himself increasingly boxed in. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) have all endorsed Trump. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.), in a statement Thursday, called Trump &amp;quot;the better option.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on Wednesday evening, House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Texas), House Budget Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.), House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) and House Science, Space and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) backed Trump. Price is a longtime political ally of Ryan\u2019s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan personifies the split inside the Republican Party caused by Trump's stunning rise during the past year. Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee, is a serious policy wonk who has made a career out of building an image as a Ronald Reagan-Jack Kemp hybrid \u2014 ideologically stringent but with a sunny disposition. Trump, on the other hand, is an uber-rich political showman who has rejected much of the conservative agenda for his own cult of personality built on his assertion that he will make America and Americans winners again somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priebus, who sat in on the session, described the meeting on Twitter as &amp;quot;great. It was a very positive step toward party unity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan's colleagues, even those who back Trump, know he is going to proceed carefully in his dealings with the real estate mogul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Paul Ryan is not the kind of individual that after a single meeting is going to say, 'OK, now I understand everything I need to do, give me the flag, I'm going to go start running forward,'&amp;quot; Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) told CNN before the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any Trump appearance \u2014 but especially one with the stakes of today's event \u2014 there were hordes of media present, as well as pro and anti-Trump protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Trump's arrival at the RNC building \u2014 he and Ryan went in the back door \u2014 a group of Hispanic protesters stood in front of the GOP headquarters bashing Trump's stand on undocumented immigrants. They chanted over a white and red banner that read &amp;quot;United We Dream&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;End Deportation.&amp;quot; Others held signs that read &amp;quot;The GOP: The Party of Trump.&amp;quot; Or &amp;quot;Rabbis Against Trump.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Make way for Donald Trump!&amp;quot; claimed another protester holding a pink sign that read &amp;quot;Trump is a Racist.&amp;quot; Following her was a man in an oversize papier-m&amp;acirc;ch&amp;eacute; mask of Trump, carrying money bags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security was tight around GOP headquarters as Trump's meetings with GOP brass kicked off.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;A wall of Secret Service agents and U.S. Capitol Police officers kept reporters and and protesters away from the entrance used by Trump and Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ryan-Trump t&amp;ecirc;te-&amp;agrave;-t&amp;ecirc;te began promptly at 9 a.m. By 9:30, McCarthy and the rest of the House GOP leadership team had slipped into RNC headquarters as well. The broader meeting began at 10 and lasted for 35 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McConnell and Senate GOP leaders were set to met with Trump after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spectacle \u2014 hundreds of reporters and TV cameras, as well as the protesters only a couple blocks from the Capitol \u2014 was too much to resist, even for lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.), now a lobbyist, stood on the sidewalk gawking like everyone else.  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) stopped to snap a photo of the scene with his phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rachael Bade contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:48:32 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>jbresnahan@politico.com (John Bresnahan)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/paul-ryan-donald-trump-meeting-223111</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Top Trump ally on Capitol Hill: He snubbed us</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/duncan-hunter-trump-snub-223126</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of Donald Trump's top allies in Congress slammed the presumptive GOP nominee after he failed to meet with rank-and-file lawmakers backing his campaign during his ballyhooed trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) told POLITICO that Trump refused multiple requests to meet with members of Congress working to round up support for him in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI think it would have been good of him&amp;quot; to meet with &amp;quot;the first endorsers,&amp;quot; Hunter said, as well as those who've gotten on board more recently, Hunter said. \u201cThere is no reason not to have as many people on your side as you can \u2026 and he missed a real opportunity here.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump met with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and several others in leadership during a series of meetings on Thursday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His most ardent congressional backers, however, asked his campaign several times for a few minutes with the candidate, too. They thought it would energize the team running traps to whip support for him in Washington. They also wanted Trump to meet with a core group of committee chairs they thought would make for powerful future allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter said the complaint isn't about his ego, contending that face time with rank-and-file lawmakers would actually have helped Trump in the long run by making it easier for them to vouch for the candidate with voters in their districts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf they endorse him, then go back to their districts to say they\u2019ve met him and he\u2019s not crazy, it goes a long way,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt helps if you can say, 'I met the guy' ... and can be beneficial for Trump, too.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An aide to another Republican lawmaker backing Trump, however, called Hunter's criticism a bit much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These concerns about access are overblown. The early endorsers have had a number of opportunities to meet and talk with Donald Trump. Today\u2019s meetings with Speaker Ryan and the House Leadership are direct outgrowth of those discussions,&amp;quot; the aide said. &amp;quot;It is expected that Mr. Trump will be in Washington a great deal in the weeks ahead, providing new opportunities for members to continue their dialogue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:33:27 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>rbade@politico.com (Rachael Bade)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/duncan-hunter-trump-snub-223126</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump to Senate GOP: I get your concerns</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-meets-senate-republicans-223118</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Republican senators that met with Donald Trump on Thursday were united by a shared concern: Trump\u2019s tone and rhetoric. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several lawmakers gently told him that what he says and how he says it matters, both for Trump\u2019s general election campaign and their own chances of keeping the Senate. Trump was in \u201clistening mode,\u201d attendees at the meeting told POLITICO, but gave them the answer that they wanted to hear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cI get that,\u201d Trump told the nearly dozen senators in attendance. Most of them were relieved to hear it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump also told senators that he would help raise money in the battle to retain the Senate, which further buoyed Republicans worried about whether he will be a down-ballot drag. In other words, it was a major step forward for the divided party, senators said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cHe was very, very congenial, very straightforward, very open to questions, criticisms and so forth,\u201d Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said. \u201cHe was terrific. I\u2019ll tell you, I was really quite impressed.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump and key aides huddled with Senate GOP leaders and party officials on Thursday morning to discuss coordinating the Senate and presidential campaigns as well as policy matters. For many senators, it was their first lengthy face-to-face meeting with their nominee, and they came away more confident that Trump will help them keep the Senate \u2014 not lose it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cObviously he\u2019s never run for public office before and so this is a new experience for him and for us,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. \u201cHe recognized the impact of the presidential candidate on down-ballot races and said he looked forward to being helpful when he could.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning Trump \u2014 accompanied by convention manager Paul Manafort and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2014 met privately with Ward Baker, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Sharon Soderstrom, chief of staff for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), according to a GOP source. The topic at hand was how the two sides could work together this campaign season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McConnell and his leadership team then huddled with Trump, who left at around 12:45 p.m. with a wave at the press mob. There was no media availability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We had a very good meeting. Very good, constructive meeting,&amp;quot; McConnell told reporters. &amp;quot;We talked about a variety of things, both campaign related and issues.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GOP leaders then gave a quick presentation to the full 54-member Republican caucus at lunch, informing them that in their view, Trump seemed interested in working with them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meeting between senators and the GOP nominee, lawmakers mixed policy with politics as Trump sat back and listened \u2014 one attendee said that Trump spoke less than half the time during the meeting with senators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was better than expected \u2026 he was not just listening he was responding,\u201d said one attendee. \u201cIt was not antagonistic. It was positive. There was a discussion of differences of some issues.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the Senate Republicans who attended the meeting also took turns taking a photo with Trump, with the presumptive nominee giving a thumbs-up in all the pictures, another source familiar with the meeting said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cornyn encouraged Trump to attend the Texas Republican Convention this weekend, though Trump's handlers shook their heads &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; as Trump expressed interest in taking Cornyn's advice. The Texas senator also offered to be an adviser in attracting the Latino vote after winning reelection in Texas in 2014 \u2014 an overture that reflects many Republicans\u2019 concerns with his statements that many people that come over the southern border are \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cmurderers.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Trump is even reaching out to his harshest critics. After Trump requested his national security expertise, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he spoke to Trump on Wednesday, even though he still won\u2019t vote for the business mogul. The conversation was \u201cvery cordial, funny,\u201d Graham said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cHe\u2019s got a great sense of humor. He\u2019s from New York, he obviously can take a punch,\u201d Graham told reporters. \u201cI wished him well and that\u2019s where we are.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) set the tone early on Thursday, issuing a diplomatic joint statement with Trump after their morning meeting. And Republican senators stayed on message as well, praising the sit-down and offering generalities about working together with a nominee who's at odds with party leaders' views on trade, Planned Parenthood, health care and foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants in the meeting talked about &amp;quot;all sorts of things. It was a good meeting,&amp;quot; said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Republican senators who attended the meeting: McConnell; Cornyn; Conference Chairman John Thune of South Dakota; Policy Chairman John Barrasso of Wyoming; Conference Vice-Chair Roy Blunt of Missouri; NRSC Chair Roger Wicker of Mississippi; Senate President Pro Tem Hatch; Rob Portman of Ohio;  Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia; and Fischer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Portman, Capito and Fischer are three of McConnell's four counsels to leadership. The fourth, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, was not invited to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the only Republican senator to endorse Trump while the primary was still being contested, also attended the meeting.

And they couldn\u2019t be handling him more differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning, the two leaders will come face-to-face with Trump on Capitol Hill as the party lurches toward the general election. But in the days leading up to the meeting, they\u2019ve taken divergent approaches toward the billionaire mogul and presumptive nominee: McConnell has moved cautiously, offering a lukewarm endorsement while staying out of the limelight. Ryan, on the other hand, has publicly challenged Trump to change his ways, while withholding his endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one level, the Senate majority leader and House speaker have a generational, ideological and temperamental gulf between them that explains the sharp difference in tone and strategy. Beyond that, however, the unique political circumstances of the House and Senate are driving the split approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McConnell faces a stiff challenge to defend his Senate majority, working off a map filled with purple states that could relegate the GOP leader to the minority if Trump supporters turn their backs on incumbent Republicans in states like Ohio, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Ryan faces little threat of losing the House, yet has a slate of members from conservatives to moderates who have shown real disgust for Trump\u2019s rhetoric and his policy proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cRyan\u2019s got a conference with a lot of diverse interests and points of view \u2026 he\u2019s got a lot of people in his conference in districts where maybe Trump doesn\u2019t poll well. I think he\u2019ll eventually come around to where Mitch is,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 leader and a former House colleague of Ryan\u2019s. \u201cBoth are thinking about their conference and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blink and you may have missed the key moment for McConnell. One day before Ryan refused to endorse Trump on national TV, McConnell quietly laid out his rationale for offering a tepid endorsement in a news statement: He had long committed to supporting the nominee and Trump was now the guy. It didn\u2019t get a lot of buzz, and neither did his remarks Tuesday in which he offered facts rather than opinions, concluding that Trump \u201cgot more votes than anybody else.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McConnell has gone to great, and occasionally awkward, lengths to avoid responding to the daily rhythm of the presidential race this year. But McConnell\u2019s allies say that his dispassionate assessment of the presidential race may now be an asset in working with Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe did the only logical thing \u2026 there\u2019s not a lot of other options there,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). \u201cWe just need to accept the reality. Which is: He\u2019s going to be the nominee, we would like to maintain the majority in the Senate and the House and we need to figure ways to maximize our chances of winning in November.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not like McConnell is a close buddy with Trump, like Ryan\u2019s predecessor John Boehner. McConnell has not spoken with Trump since March, when he told the presidential candidate to tone down the violent atmosphere at some of his rallies. Declining to name Trump, McConnell also scolded him for not repudiating David Duke and said his plan to ban Muslims was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with American values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, meanwhile, chided McConnell in 2013 on Twitter for not pursuing a bigger fiscal deal with President Barack Obama but called McConnell a \u201cgood guy\u201d while attacking Cruz last month for calling McConnell a liar. While no one would mistake McConnell for a Trump cheerleader, he\u2019s also been careful not to antagonize him \u2014 a strategy that accommodates the diverse views of his members, from the \u201cNever Trump\u201d senators like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to the Trump boosters like Jeff Sessions of Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAs a leader, you have to manage your team in a way that respects and recognizes that there may be differences of opinion,\u201d said Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.). \u201cHe\u2019s very, very good at that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And allies say McConnell\u2019s careful management of Trump\u2019s rise gives the GOP leader some political capital with the presumptive nominee as his members figure out how to run alongside Trump in diverse and liberal-leaning states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McConnell has \u201cpreserved his ability to have a seat at the table without embracing the more problematic parts of his platform,\u201d said one person close to McConnell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan, on the other hand, has been the most outspoken Republican leader on Capitol Hill while disavowing Trump\u2019s tone and proposals. He\u2019s openly talked to colleagues about how some of Trump\u2019s policy pitches \u2014 trade barriers, minimum wage increases, kicking undocumented immigrants out of the nation \u2014 are not in line with his agenda. He\u2019s gone on national television saying he\u2019s not sure Trump is an authentic \u201cstandard-bearer for conservatives.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cPaul\u2019s a policy guy \u2014 it\u2019s well known,\u201d said Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, who wants the party to rally around Trump. \u201cAnd I think his support is driven in many respects by the policies someone lays out, but we haven\u2019t seen a lot of policy from Donald Trump. So I think it\u2019s understandable that Paul would be a little hesitant right now.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 46-year-old speaker \u2014 who, many believe, could run for president in 2020 \u2014 feels it\u2019s his duty to protect the party\u2019s future. And he wants to set himself up as an alternative to Trump should a backlash occur against the New Yorker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McConnell, 74, already has his dream job and won\u2019t, of course, be president \u2014 but he has to manage many colleagues who would like to be one day. That means tolerating a range of opinion different from that of endangered House members who worry Trump will carry them out of office. Graham isn\u2019t attacking Trump because he could lose his seat; he\u2019s doing it because he believes Trump is a disaster for the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senators say McConnell rarely discusses Trump in caucus meetings and doesn\u2019t tell senators how to discuss him either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t respect where he is, but it\u2019s kind of an individual thing. There really isn\u2019t a conference position on that,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who is withholding his endorsement of Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgia Republican Rep. Lynn Westmoreland \u2014 who has spoken plainly about his disapproval of Ryan\u2019s bombshell interview last week \u2014 says Ryan has a bit more leverage than McConnell, which may motivate his \u201chard-to-get\u201d play. The Senate leader, he said, will need a President Trump to help whip upper-chamber support to meet its higher 60-vote threshold on any GOP legislation. But a President Trump would need Ryan\u2019s wonkish expertise to figure out the policy nuts and bolts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cMcConnell will need Trump\u2019s help to get anything passed in the Senate,\u201d Westmoreland said. But \u201cif Trump really wants to come in here and do something about reforming taxes or cutting spending, then Paul Ryan has got to be his guy over here.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 22:28:17 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>rbade@politico.com (Rachael Bade)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-ryan-mcconnell-223091</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>House GOP budget still dead in the water</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/house-gop-budget-votes-223143</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;House Republicans still don\u2019t have the votes to pass a budget and GOP leaders are trying to figure out their next move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House Majority Whip Steve Scalise\u2019s (R-La.) team did a whip check on Thursday. While the check wasn't completed, it was clear that Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other top Republicans didn\u2019t have the votes to move a budget through, according to multiple leadership sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is now a possibility that Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will start moving spending bills to the floor next week without passing a budget first \u2014 a decision that could prove embarrassing for a former Budget Chairman like Ryan. After May 15, the House may act on appropriations bills without passing a budget, although one GOP insider said leaders are also considering passing the blueprint after they begin work on individual appropriations bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re still working on it,\u201d Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers told POLITICO. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some work to do.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leadership is trying to muster enough votes from conservatives to pass their $1.07 trillion budget \u2014 the level put in place last year under a deal inked by President Barack Obama and then-Speaker John Boehner. That\u2019s why they\u2019re adding so-called \u201cside car\u201d items to the budget, which aim to trim spending on mandatory programs like Medicaid, but would be very unlikely to be signed into law by Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some conservatives, who favor a lower spending number for federal agencies for fiscal 2017, still aren\u2019t buying what leadership is selling. Rep. Dave Brat, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, for example, said he would vote against the budget \u201cuntil the deficit comes down from $535 billion.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And fellow conservative Rep. David Schweikert said he was still undecided. \u201cThere are a couple mechanics that I need a little more detail on,\u201d the Arizona Republican said. \u201cAnd I have one request in the order of something. I\u2019m going to see if there\u2019s a chance that could be done.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the Boehner-Obama deal called for slight increases in this year's spending bills, Republicans will likely need to rely on Democrats to pass the 12 appropriations measures, as many conservatives have warned they won\u2019t vote for them. That opens up a new problem for Ryan: a question of how many Democrats will actually back the funding bills, especially if those bills are loaded with conservative policy riders \u2014 and what would he need to do to get their votes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to restart the budget process ahead of those spending bills, leadership\u2019s latest pitch to conservatives included an idea by Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) to \u201cweld\u201d together the budget resolution with $30 billion in mandatory savings \u2014 essentially offsetting the bipartisan spending boost passed last year that conservatives abhor. The second piece included a pitch by Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) to changes rules in the future to stop programs whose authorizations have expired from receiving any new funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some conservatives sound like they may be coming around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m considering it more favorably than I thought I would,\u201d said Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), also a member of the House Freedom Caucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she\u2019s undecided, and said reservations linger: \u201cI\u2019m hearing people say, \u2018It\u2019s not going to even get to the president\u2019s desk, so it\u2019s window dressing.\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m going to think about it awhile longer.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), had his own demand before he would get to \u2018yes.\u2019 He told the whip team: \u201cI\u2019m waiting for my mental health bill.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even appropriators like Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) say they\u2019re still sorting through the new deal. Dent previously supported the $1.07 trillion top-line without any additional savings and has authored his Military Construction-Veterans Affairs spending bill based on that level. Dent said he\u2019s hopeful the appropriations bill will head to the floor next week, with or without budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 23:17:14 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>mnussbaum@politico.com (Matthew Nussbaum)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/house-gop-budget-votes-223143</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Koch-backed group targets first GOP incumbent in primary</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/koch-group-targets-renee-ellmers-223124</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Americans for Prosperity is planning a major expenditure to defeat North Carolina Republican Rep. &lt;a href=\"https://cd.politicopro.com/people/151843\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Renee Ellmers&lt;/a&gt; in her June primary, an unprecedented move for the powerful Koch brothers-backed conservative nonprofit, which has never targeted a GOP member of Congress for primary defeat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cRep. Renee Ellmers has sadly become a part of the very Washington she once claimed she wanted to fix,&amp;quot; said AFP President Tim Phillips. \u201cAfter giving Rep. Ellmers every chance to match her votes to her prior rhetoric, she\u2019s demonstrated an unacceptable pattern of supporting wasteful government spending and corporate welfare. North Carolinians deserve a true conservative who will fight for them, not special interests.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AFP plans to target voters in Ellmers\u2019 district with six-figures worth of advertising, including five to eight separate mailers, as well as digital ads on streaming platforms, like YouTube, Facebook and Hulu, in the four weeks leading up to the June 7 primary. Ellmers faces fellow GOP Rep. &lt;a href=\"https://cd.politicopro.com/people/70574\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;George Holding&lt;/a&gt; and two-time Senate candidate Greg Brannon in the Republican race for a newly drawn seat anchored in the Raleigh suburbs, which was created by court-ordered redistricting earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of AFP\u2019s political spending targets Democrats \u2014 in 2013 and 2014, the group blitzed Democratic senators with tens of millions of dollars in early attack ads on health care and other subjects. It rarely gets involved in major Republican primaries. In 2014, the group spent hundreds of thousands of dollars supporting GOP Rep. &lt;a href=\"https://cd.politicopro.com/people/158348\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Mike Pompeo&lt;/a&gt;, whose Wichita, Kansas-based district includes the Koch Industries headquarters, against a primary challenger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AFP\u2019s first foray into anti-incumbent primary spending comes in a state where the group has its deepest roots. North Carolina was one of the first states where AFP opened a chapter office in 2004. The state division of the group now has 12 full-time staffers and eight field directors, who will conduct a grass-roots persuasion campaign against Ellmers, as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ellmers would have seemed an unusual target for conservative ire when she swept into Congress on the tea party wave in 2010. In 2012, the former nurse even appeared at an AFP Hands Off Our Healthcare rally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; But critics say that Ellmers quickly became a leadership ally and establishment member since she arrived in Washington. The Club for Growth, another conservative organization, is opposing her in a second consecutive election, and Ellmers has &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/renee-ellmers-anti-abortion-groups-221296\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;clashed with anti-abortion groups,&lt;/a&gt; as well. And AFP has called out Ellmers for votes, including one last year to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, an issue that became a major point of contention within the Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; AFP is not endorsing any of Ellmers' opponents, the group says. But it does directly contrast Ellmers and Holding in one of the ads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; \u201cAmericans balance their budgets, work hard. Renee Ellmers promised to do the same, but she became a part of the Washington problem,\u201d &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kfIFeFHwRM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the ad\u2019s narrator says&lt;/a&gt;. \u201cShe promised spending limits, then voted against them. She ran against special interest deals, then voted for them. But George Holding kept his word. Opposing wasteful spending, protecting taxpayers, standing up to special interests.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; \u201cVote \u2018no\u2019 on Renee Ellmers,\u201d the narrator finishes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ellmers said in an interview last week that she is the same candidate she was in 2010, and that she has kept the promises she made to voters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; \u201cI\u2019ve stood on the principles that I was running on [in 2010] and I have held on to them. There are people out there who were of a different mindset, assuming their form of conservatism and my form of conservatism were the same, but mine is more common sense conservatism,\u201d Ellmers said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how voting \u2018no\u2019 all the time makes you more conservative.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; AFP\u2019s spending will pile onto other anti-Ellmers outside efforts ahead of June 7. The Club for Growth recently announced plans to spend money opposing her, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;Renee Ellmers first ran as a tea party conservative, but has become an establishment liberal in Washington,&amp;quot; Club for Growth President David McIntosh said in statement. &amp;quot;With a lifetime Club for Growth rating of 60 percent and a 2015 score of 57 percent, Ellmers is clearly betraying the conservative values of her constituents.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ellmers said she doesn\u2019t make decisions based on \u201coutside group scorecards.\u201d &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; \u201c[Club for Growth] has no control over me, as they do over my opponent. They\u2019ve been coming at me in various ways since 2013,\u201d Ellmers said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for me to highlight the doers against the ones who sit back and take a pass on everything and wait for the special interest groups to tell them what to do.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ellmers\u2019 outgunned campaign is fighting back. It released a radio ad Thursday attacking Holding for&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a recent &amp;quot;first-class trip to Jordan,&amp;quot; a spokesman for Ellmers confirmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; \u201cFor Congress, we have a choice between a man who fancies cheese tortellini \u2026 and one powerful conservative in Renee Ellmers,\u201d the radio ad says. \u201cGeorge Holding voted against the farm bill, against military funding to defeat ISIS. But Holding voted for cheese tortellini when selecting his meal for a recent first-class ticket on a trans-Atlantic flight that he billed to you, the taxpayer.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eli Stokols contributed reporting. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:15:20 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>eschneider@politico.com (Elena Schneider)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/koch-group-targets-renee-ellmers-223124</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>2016 presidential campaign: Latest updates</title>\n      <description/>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>House GOP wins Obamacare lawsuit</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/house-gop-wins-obamacare-lawsuit-223121</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A federal judge on Thursday ruled the Obama administration has been improperly funding an Obamacare subsidy program, a huge win for the House of Representatives in a lawsuit against the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress authorized the program but never actually provided the money for it, wrote U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary M. Collyer. The program will be allowed to continue, pending appeal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one,\u201d wrote Collyer, a George W. Bush appointee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling, if it stands, could be a significant financial setback for the millions of low-income Americans who benefit from the cost-sharing subsidies, which help people pay for out-of-pocket costs like co-pays at a doctor\u2019s office. It would not be a fatal blow to the future of the president\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement, but it could push insurance costs higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans have praised the challenge as a needed check on the White House's authority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This decision is a critical step in protecting Congress' power of the purse from an administration that has repeatedly ignored a fundamental principle of our Republic: the separation of powers,&amp;quot; said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration is expected to immediately appeal the decision to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is not the first time that we\u2019ve seen opponents of the Affordable Care Act go through the motions to try to win this political fight in the court system,&amp;quot; said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health care law was designed to reimburse insurers for providing the cost-sharing subsidies to low-income customers who purchased exchange coverage. A second Obamacare subsidy program helping customers pay monthly premiums wasn't a target in the House lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House argues that the cost-sharing program was authorized but never appropriated. The House says that there is proof that the White House knew the cost-sharing subsidies weren\u2019t funded and worked around the legislation to implement them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House asked Congress to fund the program in its fiscal 2014 budget request, which was denied. It then unilaterally funded the program through the refundable tax credit account anyway, the House lawyers argued in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he filed the &lt;i&gt;House v. Burwell &lt;/i&gt;lawsuit two years ago, former House Speaker John Boehner framed it as a check on the executive branch\u2019s ability to change legislation once it was approved by Congress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Justice Department says the subsidies were funded appropriately. Its lawyers told the court that the program was funded in the same pot of money as the law\u2019s refundable tax credits to help people pay for premiums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the Obama administration\u2019s defense is that the health law was not written well \u2014 an argument it also made during prior Obamacare legal battles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration argued that the budget request cited by the House isn\u2019t proof of malfeasance. Justice Department lawyers said the request did not fully account for \u201ctext, structure, design and history of the ACA \u2014 a complex statute that the Supreme Court recently described as containing \u2018more than a few examples of inartful drafting.'\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration also heavily relied on last year's Supreme Court decision in &lt;i&gt;King v. Burwell &lt;/i&gt;\u2014 which was centered on the health law\u2019s premium subsidies \u2014 to stress that a court must look at an entire law, not specific provisions. It says that the two subsidy programs were designed to work together as one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost-sharing subsidies are available to people with incomes between the federal poverty level and 250 percent FPL \u2014 or between $24,300 and $60,750 for a family of four \u2014 to help pay for health care services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several million Obamacare customers receive cost-sharing subsidies, but the exact figure is unknown. As of the middle of the last Obamacare enrollment period, &lt;a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/167986/MarketPlaceAddendumJan2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;57 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people who signed up for coverage through the federal exchange on HealthCare.gov receive them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the cost-sharing subsidies are eliminated, government actuaries estimate that insurers would &lt;a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/156571/ASPE_IB_CSRs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;increase premiums&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 up to 20 percent to 30 percent for silver-tiered plans \u2014 to make up for the loss. As a result, the premium tax credits would increase, at a higher cost to the federal government, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurers downplayed the ruling Thursday. &amp;quot;There is a long judicial process ahead before a final decision is made,&amp;quot; said Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry's main lobbying group. &amp;quot;Our members' focus is and will remain on serving consumers \u2014 to ensure their coverage is protected and their health care choices are maintained.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the subsidies are ultimately struck, it would reinforce claims from opponents of the health law that the Obamacare insurance plans are not actually affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House originally wanted to challenge both the cost-sharing subsidies and the executive branch\u2019s changes to Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate. But the mandate challenges were tossed in an earlier court ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration had tried to get the case thrown out on procedural grounds, contending that the House can\u2019t bring litigation against the executive branch. But in September, &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/house-obamacare-lawsuit-cost-sharing-subsidies-213465\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Collyer allowed the suit to proceed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, the White House and legal allies slammed the decision as unprecedented, arguing that this was a political battle, not a legal one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit is the latest in what has been a persistent series of legal challenges for Obamacare. The Supreme Court has ruled twice in the law\u2019s favor. In 2012, it upheld the individual mandate and, in 2015, it upheld the premium tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the justices said that closely held companies don\u2019t have to provide birth control under the law if they have religious objections. The court is now considering a similar challenge from nonprofit organizations with religious ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nick Gass contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:38:49 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>jhaberkorn@politico.com (Jennifer Haberkorn)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/house-gop-wins-obamacare-lawsuit-223121</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Rubio enlists James Baker to knock Trump</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/marco-rubio-james-baker-donald-trump-223142</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Marco Rubio\u2019s latest shot at Donald Trump came with an assist from James Baker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican Florida senator, who abandoned the presidential race earlier this year after repeated drubbings by Trump, asked the revered GOP elder statesman on Thursday what he thought of suggestions by \u201csome people\u201d that more countries should have nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe more countries that acquire nuclear weapons, the more instability there is going to be in the world,\u201d replied Baker, a former secretary of state, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has said he\u2019s open to the idea of Japan, South Korea and even Saudi Arabia having their own nuclear defenses, instead of relying on America\u2019s security umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker was testifying during a session titled \u201cExamining America\u2019s Role in the World.\u201d And although he didn\u2019t talk about Trump directly, it was clear that Baker wasn\u2019t in line with the GOP presidential front-runner\u2019s foreign policy ideas. (However, Baker met with Trump and his advisers later Thursday at the Jones Day law firm.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, for instance, has questioned the usefulness of NATO, and whether the U.S. is carrying too much of the security alliance\u2019s burden. But Baker stressed that international alliances are important and actually \u201cstrengthen America.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker, considered a realist in foreign policy circles, promoted what he called \u201cselective engagement,\u201d a paradigm that appears to call on the U.S. to evaluate international crises on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on protecting its vital interests while keeping a high bar for military intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe approach I suggest does not fall easily into traditional categories of foreign policy \u2014 that is: \u2018realism\u2019 or \u2018idealism,\u2019\u201d Baker said in his written testimony. \u201cIt contains the \u2018best elements of both.\u2019 And it represents one of our most distinctive national characteristics: We are a practical people less interested in ideological purity than in solving problems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker is a long-time ally of the Bush family, and it\u2019s unlikely he would have kind words for Trump. Jeb Bush, the son of former President George H.W. Bush, quit the presidential race but has said he will not endorse Trump to be his party\u2019s nominee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hearing was organized by Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the committee's chairman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corker has recently spoken out favorably about Trump's foreign policy ideas, suggesting the real estate mogul has been influenced by Baker, even though many observers say the real estate mogul is incoherent on international issues. As a result of his kind words for Trump, some have been floating Corker as a potential vice presidential pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:24:40 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Nahal Toosi</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/marco-rubio-james-baker-donald-trump-223142</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Boehner: 'Anyone who thinks Donald Trump can't win, just watch'</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/john-boehner-trump-can-win-223122</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As his successor was trying to &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/paul-ryan-donald-trump-meeting-223111\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;work through his disagreements &lt;/a&gt;with Donald Trump on Capitol Hill on Thursday, John Boehner was sounding off on the GOP's presumptive nominee from 2,400 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former House speaker said at the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference on Thursday that Trump is the nominee &amp;quot;whether people like it or not,&amp;quot; the AP &lt;a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/773211d1ffba41c5a45574db0b093ae0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anyone who thinks Donald Trump can't win, just watch,&amp;quot; Boehner said at the Las Vegas gathering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current House Speaker Paul Ryan, Boehner explained, is &amp;quot;trying to help shape the direction of Trump's policies.&amp;quot; And the retired Ohio lawmaker said he himself doesn't support Trump's policies on Muslims and trade deals, but suggested they weren't enough to break with the new face of the Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boehner did say he was thankful Ted Cruz didn't win the nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank God that guy from Texas didn\u2019t win,\u201d he said, according to The Wall Street Journal, noting that he drew criticism for giving the devil a &amp;quot;bad name&amp;quot; by &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/john-beohner-ted-cruz-lucifer-222570\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;referring to&lt;/a&gt; Cruz as &amp;quot;Lucifer in the flesh&amp;quot; last month. &amp;quot;I have Democrat friends and Republican friends.

I believe that if you\u2019re a Republican, then you respect the voters\u2019 choice,&amp;quot; the former Arkansas governor wrote in a post on his website titled &amp;quot;Romney\u2019s motto 'Do unto Others as has been done unto me.'&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I am especially disappointed in Mitt for this latest attack,&amp;quot; Huckabee continued. &amp;quot;He\u2019s not only trying to sink his own party\u2019s presumptive nominee, but he\u2019s factually incorrect and he\u2019s making the same unfair attack on Trump that was launched against him in 2012.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney alluded to his initial refusal to release his tax returns in a &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/mitt-romney-donald-trump-tax-returns-223088\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Facebook post &lt;/a&gt;Wednesday that otherwise excoriated the party's presumptive nominee's withholding of the documents as &amp;quot;disqualifying.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anticipating inquiries regarding my own tax release history, I released my 2010 tax returns in January of 2012 and I released my 2011 tax returns as soon as they were completed, in September of 2012,&amp;quot; Romney wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huckabee wrote that he has &amp;quot;long argued&amp;quot; that candidates should resist calls to release their personal tax forms. If Trump does not release his tax returns by Election Day, he will be the first candidate to forgo the practice since President Gerald Ford released a summary in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, Huckabee added, the average voter stands to learn little about Trump from the documents but they could be a &amp;quot;treasure trove for opponents to lift items out of context to make him look shady.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Early in my political career, I volunteered to release all my tax returns. Why not? I had nothing to hide. If anything, I was probably too honest and paid too much tax. It sure felt like it! But I learned that honesty and good intentions don\u2019t count for squat in politics,&amp;quot; Huckabee wrote. &amp;quot;My opponents still twisted things out of context to try to make me look like a tax cheat. You can do that to anyone because nobody understands the tax code, not even the IRS agents in charge of enforcing it.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If Mitt Romney wants to talk about taxes while showing the world what a real Republican stands for, he should stop trying to destroy the party\u2019s presumptive nominee and instead aim his fire at a more appropriate target: the 70,000-plus-page tax code,&amp;quot; Huckabee concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:59:43 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>ngass@politico.com (Nick Gass)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/mike-huckabee-slams-mitt-romney-223123</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump accuses Bezos of using the Washington Post to avoid taxes</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-jeff-bezos-washington-post-223148</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump is done with Jeff Bezos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Thursday night, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee alleged that the Amazon founder uses the Washington Post to secure tax benefits for his company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cEvery hour we\u2019re getting calls from reporters from The Washington Post asking ridiculous questions and I will tell you, this is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos, who controls Amazon,\u201d Trump said in response to Hannity's question about how the paper has assigned some 20 reporters to dig deep into his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon is \u201cgetting away with murder, tax-wise,\u201d said Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don\u2019t tax Amazon like they should be taxed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bezos, who purchased the Post in 2013 for $250 million, has a broader \u201cantitrust\u201d problem, Trump alleged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAmazon is controlling so much of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what they\u2019ve done is he bought this paper for practically nothing and he\u2019s using that as a tool for political power against me and against people and I\u2019ll tell you what, we can\u2019t let him get away with it.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump went on to criticize the Post's reporters, who he claimed have reported inaccurately on his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI just heard, they\u2019re taking these really bad stories, I mean they\u2019re wrong, I wouldn\u2019t even say bad, they\u2019re wrong and in many cases they have no proper information,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe\u2019s using The Washington Post, which is peanuts, he\u2019s using that for political purposes to save Amazon in terms of taxes and in terms of antitrust,\u201d Trump reiterated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bezos has long said he purchased the paper because he thought he might be able to save an important journalistic institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the newspaper business, but I did know something about the Internet,\u201d Bezos &lt;a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/amazons-bezos-explains-why-he-bought-the-washington-post/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a conference in 2014. \u201cThat, combined with the financial runway that I can provide, is the reason why I bought The Post.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week, &lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/woodward-20-wapo-reporters-dig-dirt-on-trump-every-phase-of-his-life/article/2591021\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the Washington Examiner&lt;/a&gt; reported on comments the Post\u2019s Bob Woodward made at a realtor trade association conference in the city.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There's a lot we don't know,&amp;quot; he said, according to the Examiner. &amp;quot;We have 20 people working on Trump, we're going to do a book, we're doing articles about every phase of his life.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodward also said the Bezos had urged the paper to report thoroughly on the presidential candidates, according to the Examiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He said, 'Look the job at the Washington Post has to be tell us everything about who the eventual nominee will be in both parties, 15-part, 16-part series, 20-part series. We want to look at every part of their lives and we're never going get the whole story of course but we can get the best attainable,\u201d Woodward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day today, Executive Editor Martin Baron addressed the question this way: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAs the individual who oversees The Washington Post\u2019s news staff, I can say categorically that I have received no instructions from Jeff Bezos regarding our coverage of the presidential campaign \u2014 or, for that matter, any other subject.

Publishers are losing control over their relationships with readers, she notes, their revenue sources, and the paths their stories take to reach their destination. If the trend accelerates, Facebook will become the universal default newsstand, and publishers will become supplicant to its will, as theory would have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear of Facebook has become so widespread that anonymously sourced &lt;a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;allegations&lt;/a&gt; aired in Gizmodo this week that the site \u201csuppresses\u201d conservative news elicited a &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/technology/facebook-thune-conservative.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;demand&lt;/a&gt; from Sen. John Thune (R, S.D.) that the company explain its \u201cbiases.\u201d The allegations are largely bunk, as &lt;a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/10/11649682/facebook-trending-box-bias-conservative-news\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Nilay Patel&lt;/a&gt; quickly demonstrated in the &lt;i&gt;Verve&lt;/i&gt;, but the anxieties that Facebook dominance elicits among journalists are not unfounded. According to a new Knight Foundation &lt;a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/publication_pdfs/KF_Mobile-Report_Final_050916.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook has become the most popular social networking app for news-seeking\u201470 percent of Facebook users access the news through the site daily. &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FFacebook&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=business&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=stream_unit&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=8&amp;amp;pgtype=collection\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Users&lt;/a&gt; spend an average of 50 minutes a day (up from 40 minutes in 2014) on Facebook or its Instagram and Messenger platforms, which is more time, on average, than Americans spend reading (19 minutes) and only a few less than they spend eating (1.07 hours) each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFacebook\u2019s potential is without precedent,\u201d reads the subhead to a &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/the-facebook-future/482145/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;current&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Atlantic &lt;/i&gt;article by Derek Thompson that views the social network\u2019s swelling power as unprecedented. \u201cFacebook\u2019s influence on media might not yet have peaked,\u201d he writes, positing that in the foreseeable future it may \u201cconnect every person in the world around any visual and auditory event, past and live.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson\u2019s meditation would put a jolt of fear in me if I hadn\u2019t read similar passages about the transformational qualities of earlier gadgets and technology. Every couple of years, it seems, some new product or service so upsets the status quo that people mistake big changes for the end of time. For instance, when the home VCR landed on the market in the 1980s, motion picture industry lobbyist Jack Valenti predicted it would kill the movie business, saying it was to \u201cthe American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But almost always, the fears voiced about new technology are overstated. That\u2019s been especially true of markets that make up the Internet, where new businesses have a way of storming outta nowhere to a seemingly invincible position and then receding as new competitors arrive or as new products are invented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best example of this pattern is AOL, which was regarded in the early 1990s as the undeniable and unbeatable online leader. People worried that as AOL achieved a critical mass of users\u2014and what was going to stop it?\u2014its proprietary \u201cwalled garden\u201d of email, news, chat and shopping services would monopolize the market and leave no room for competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then the Web happened, and AOL was displaced by \u201cportals\u201d like &lt;a href=\"http://www.therichest.com/business/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-yahoo-empire/?view=all\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; that used humans to sort and index the chaotic Web. The Yahoo portal enjoyed only brief moment as the leading online service after it was challenged by increasingly sophisticated &lt;a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/articles/internet-search-engines-history\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;search engines&lt;/a&gt;, most notably Google, which made it easy to navigate the Web. The paranoid fears directed at Facebook today were the property of Google back then. A 2005 &lt;i&gt;Wired &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2005/12/google-7/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; worried that Google initiatives in classifieds, free Wi-Fi, e-commerce and other areas would add to its market dominance. Would Google take over TiVo&lt;i&gt;, Wired &lt;/i&gt;asked? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Google has grown into the &lt;a href=\"http://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; largest company in the world, the absoluteness of its power has been more imaginary than absolute. Google, it\u2019s worth noting, entered the social networking business with Orkut in 2004, the same year Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook in his Harvard dorm room, and it has been unable to beat him despite its extraordinary head start in the online business. And Orkut has been only &lt;a href=\"http://mashable.com/2010/07/09/google-social-media-attempts/#hQGMywKQ2iqF\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of Google\u2019s efforts, as it has aimed other social network products, such as Google Plus, Google Buzz and Google Wave at Facebook, and missed widely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of lessons emerge from this brief review of online history, the first being that no matter how large an incumbent company might be, it can &lt;i&gt;always &lt;/i&gt;be successfully challenged by a smaller enterprise. Just as Facebook\u2019s David beat Google\u2019s Goliath in the social network business, somebody with imagination and a few investors should be able to do the same to Facebook in the news space. Instead of whining about Facebook \u201cstealing\u201d eyeballs and ad revenues\u2014and that is the subtext of most \u201cFear of Facebook\u201d pieces\u2014conventional news organizations need to compete. Every day the deck gets shuffled and new cards get dealt. No publisher has a future right to the readers\u2019 attention or to ad revenues just because it has enjoyed huge attention and large revenues in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should the conventional news business do to throw off the Facebook yoke, which is getting heavier every day? Stop complaining. Stop delegating mobile distribution to the Facebook behemoth. And start competing. It\u2019s not like the Internet or the mobile world started yesterday! My first suggestion would be to find a very smart, very industrious college student\u2014such as the ones who started Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Snapchat, or college dropouts like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs\u2014and turn the job over to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If no young geniuses are available to wage news war with Facebook, news business could work on ideas to win back a measure of control over their mobile distribution. Apple isn\u2019t afraid to compete: It has created a news &lt;a href=\"https://www.apple.com/news/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; to do battle with the Facebook news feed.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Why won\u2019t publishers make a similar investment to gain market share and acquire some leverage over Facebook to extract the best terms? Publishers need not start new apps from the ground up, as Apple is doing. A news company or a consortium of news companies could strike a news distribution deal with one of the existing top mobile apps. Which apps might that be? Pandora is the only app in the &lt;a href=\"http://qz.com/481245/these-are-the-25-most-popular-2015-mobile-apps-in-america/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;top nine mobile apps&lt;/a&gt; (as measured by unique viewers) that is owned neither by Facebook nor by Google. Why not buy Pandora (market cap &lt;a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=P\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;$2.33 billion&lt;/a&gt;) or contract with the company to add a news module to its exceedingly popular app. Perhaps a better fit, in terms of an app with high engagement, would be Twitter, the 14th most popular mobile app.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to sound flip about it, Facebook isn\u2019t the publishers\u2019 ultimate problem. Their ultimate problem is accelerating technological change\u2014if it weren\u2019t Facebook stealing their lunch, it would be Google or Microsoft or some other tech outfit. Instead of drooping its collective head and feeling put-on, news organizations need to pluck up and understand that they aren\u2019t only vulnerable players, that creative destruction stalks us all. A new platform or technology will arrive any day, making Facebook irrelevant. As irrelevant as AOL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;******&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please instruct intelligent college dropouts to send email to &lt;a href=\"mailto:shafer.politico@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Shafer.Politico@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.

He pointed to Clinton's blistering tirade against the ads in a November 1993 speech as the pivotal moment that accidentally elevated insurers' agenda. &amp;quot;Every time we did a new ad ... we were on the evening news.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's one of those things that starts drip, drip, drip \u2014 and then it pours,&amp;quot; Kahn said. &amp;quot;It wasn't meant to necessarily have the effect it did.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demise of their signature health initiative shadowed the Clintons for the rest of their time in the White House, and Hillary Clinton even boasts of the experience these days as one of her liberal bona fides, saying, &amp;quot;I've got the scars to show for it.&amp;quot; But much of her success in November may come down to how well she has learned the lessons from that defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kahn said the scenario the industry's campaign created \u2014 start a firestorm with some paid ads, then fuel it with a lot of free coverage \u2014 reminds him of the rise of Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $20 million &lt;a href=\"http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2cee031604aed45eee03d8f51d53d5f1ccc90e011cbe17c87a72f0758371ab22\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;ad campaign&lt;/a&gt; has become part of Washington lore for its devastating simplicity: A pair of middle-age actors sitting at a kitchen table, fretting about the horrors in store if the Clinton plan creates a government-driven system to control their health care. The middle-aged couple &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd_xPNT1Fh8\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;pored over&lt;/a&gt; calculators and piles of paper, fretting about the new bureaucratic restrictions, extra costs and lost choices, often finishing with the lament: \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be a better way.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the industry wanted, Kahn said, was a seat at the table, even before it began running the ads. But the White House was &amp;quot;very negative,&amp;quot; he said, especially Hillary Clinton and top health care adviser Ira Magaziner. In one meeting, Magaziner &amp;quot;turned off his hearing aid,&amp;quot; Kahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There were many middle grounds we could find, but they didn't look for them and we didn\u2019t stop&amp;quot; running the ads, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Hillary Clinton\u2019s response, he said, further fanned the flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign quickly became a burr in the side of the White House, fighting to save its beleaguered health plan. As anxiety mounted, a Democratic National Committee staffer threatened the actress who played Louise, telling her that if she didn't quit the ads, she'd never work in Hollywood again. And Hillary Clinton was &amp;quot;getting angrier and angrier,&amp;quot; Kahn says, culminating in a speech at a convention of pediatricians where she delivered a scathing, unscripted attack on the campaign and the industry that had funded it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They have the gall to run TV ads that there is a better way,&amp;quot; Clinton said. &amp;quot;The very industry that has brought us to the brink of bankruptcy because of the way they have financed health care.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was arguably the most furious attack on a major industry ever made by a sitting first lady, David Broder and Haynes Johnson write in their book &amp;quot;The System.&amp;quot; And it drove a damaging narrative that the unelected spouse of the president was overly involved in public policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within months, the White House health reform effort was on life support \u2014 and Bill and Hillary Clinton were reduced to performing a &amp;quot;Harry and Louise&amp;quot; parody skit (written by a &amp;quot;Saturday Night Live&amp;quot; writer) at the Gridiron dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurers' attack ads have had an enduring legacy \u2014 they eventually helped shape Democrats' approach to crafting Obamacare and have continued to influence Clinton's health care policy as a candidate. Obama administration officials learned they needed buy-in from the industry to pass a big health reform package, which ultimately meant that Obamacare included compromises that disappointed liberals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a pair of symbolic reversals, the &amp;quot;Harry and Louise&amp;quot; characters were resurrected in 2009 to &lt;a href=\"http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2cee031604aed45e27a7aaefdc5167bad502c5cb6fdbdac23fab99edfc514bad\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;sing the praises of the Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt; during its drafting \u2014 and Kahn, too, largely became an Obamacare supporter, though he doesn't hesitate to call out its flaws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I work for hospitals,&amp;quot; Kahn said, explaining his conversion. &amp;quot;The best situation for Americans \u2014and for those that hospitals serve \u2014 is for everyone to have [health] insurance.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, he\u2019s also not taking sides yet between Clinton and Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kahn did say that the government should build on the framework created by the Affordable Care Act, and if Clinton gets elected, that will be her framework too \u2014 while with Trump, we'll go a &amp;quot;different direction.&amp;quot; But if Trump wins, he thinks Republicans will maintain the House and the Senate. &amp;quot;I can't envision him winning without them gaining control. They'll take significant action on health reform.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton today repeatedly cites her 1990s battle with the insurance industry as proof of her experience fighting for liberal causes. She also uses it to cast Bernie Sanders' government-run, single-payer health care plan as a pure fantasy that powerful Washington lobbies would never allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton, whose criticism of single-payer during the Democratic primary &lt;a href=\"http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2cee031604aed45ed38a6eec8158ef15dc5417d123ef3c6e6aa9eae114572cb1\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;has stunned liberals&lt;/a&gt; who support the idea in principle, has instead advocated incremental reforms to make health insurance more affordable within the current system. Those ideas, which include capping out-of-pocket costs and forcing drug companies to negotiate prices, haven't won much support from the deep-pocketed insurance and pharmaceutical industries, either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton's most recent idea \u2014 resurrecting a &amp;quot;public option&amp;quot; and allowing younger Americans to buy into Medicare \u2014 has a wary critic: Kahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That is a proposal that is misdirected and would be a big mistake,&amp;quot; Kahn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has not yet commissioned &amp;quot;Harry and Louise&amp;quot; to explain why to voters, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:28:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>ddiamond@politico.com (Dan Diamond)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/harry-louise-and-hillary-clinton-223139</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Obama: Republicans likely to correct course after 2016</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obama-republicans-after-2016-223114</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Even as Donald Trump careens toward the Republican Party's nomination and a likely clash with Hillary Clinton in the general election, President Barack Obama believes the GOP will eventually straighten itself out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he also thinks the Republicans have only themselves to blame for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview published Thursday with&lt;a href=\"http://www.dailytargum.com/article/2016/05/president-obama-sits-down-with-the-daily-targum\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; The Daily Targum&lt;/a&gt;, Rutgers University's student newspaper, Obama mused about not only his record but also the historic contest to replace him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My sense is that there will be a corrective at some point, perhaps after this next presidential election,&amp;quot; Obama told the Targum's Dan Corey, who participated in last month's event for college journalists at the White House, at which he asked the president whether he could score a one-on-one interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama accepted that invitation ahead of delivering the school's commencement address this Sunday, using it as an opportunity to tick through his administration's accomplishments and scold the Republican Party for what he says it has become: &amp;quot;increasingly ideological and extreme, and I think that\u2019s reflected in the current presidential race.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I\u2019ve always shown myself willing to compromise \u2014 principled compromises that would still advance the interests of the American people,&amp;quot; the president remarked in the interview, conducted Monday. &amp;quot;What we\u2019ve seen within the Republican Party has been a refusal even to engage on a whole range of issues like climate change, for example, that are vitally important.

Warren, the person told POLITICO, was \u201cnoncommittal\u201d but \u201cnot displeased.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that meeting, she delivered a clear-eyed assessment of Biden\u2019s own chances, according to a staffer who was given a read-out of the conversation, telling the vice president that he had little chance of positioning himself to the left of Clinton, given his own three-decade record of moderate compromise in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren conceded \u2014 prophetically in retrospect \u2014 that Clinton would face a progressive backlash but she informed Biden that his record on Wall Street was little better than that of the woman he hoped to topple as front-runner. As a senator, Biden, like Clinton, had supported a 2001 bankruptcy bill that Warren vehemently opposed; her advice to Biden was that, to appeal to the left, he would need to start talking right away about Wall Street reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Warren declined to comment on the matter. A Biden spokeswoman said she didn\u2019t want to comment on internal discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kaufman, a former Delaware senator and Biden\u2019s longtime aide and  confidant, said Warren was a subject of discussion within Biden\u2019s inner circle as he pondered a presidential run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cShe\u2019s someone that was discussed,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cShe\u2019s clearly someone anyone would consider.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kaufman cautioned that the discussions \u201cnever got to the point\u201d of making any promises about the role she might play on a potential Biden campaign. \u201cWe were still deciding if he was going to run or not,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s obviously someone you want to talk to.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revelation of Biden\u2019s interest in Warren is timely: The Massachusetts senator, who has not yet endorsed a candidate for president, has been careful to avoid any statement that would indicate she favored ideological soulmate Bernie Sanders over the more centrist Clinton. But progressives have begun pitching Warren as a possible Clinton vice presidential pick to heal the divisions between the center and left of the Democratic Party after the protracted duel between Clinton and Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Warren hasn\u2019t entirely resisted the suggestion \u2014 in part, because it gives her leverage to influence Clinton\u2019s potential staffing decisions in the Treasury Department and financial oversight boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the 66-year-old former Harvard Law professor refused to rule out accepting an offer to join Clinton on the 2016 ticket, employing the kind of non-answer answer she\u2019s used throughout much of the campaign to stay above the fray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe've got to get all of our nominations settled on the Democratic side,\u201d she told the website Mic when asked the veep question. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m going to keep doing my job every single day and I\u2019m not thinking about another job.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren \u2014 to the delight of Clinton\u2019s staff \u2014 has recently trained her fire on Donald Trump, a move that many Clintonites interpret as evidence that the darling of the Democrats\u2019 anti-establishment wing might be willing to accept Clinton, despite the front-runner\u2019s deep and lucrative connections to the New York financial services sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Warren cut a deal to endorse Clinton and serve in her administration, it\u2019s not clear whether all of her backers \u2014 or Sanders\u2019 steadfast supporters \u2014 would automatically jump aboard the Hillary bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI find it highly improbable that a leading voice in the progressive movement, whether it be Elizabeth Warren or someone else, would want to be sitting in the vice president\u2019s office or in the Cabinet,\u201d said Jonathan Tasini, a New York-based Sanders supporter who isn\u2019t ready to give up the fight for Bernie. \u201cWould Warren or any true progressive be willing to make the obvious compromises that a moderate corporate Democrat Hillary would demand? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not clear whether Biden has remained in touch with Warren since their last meeting, or what he thinks of the prospects that another progressive \u2014 Sanders \u2014 would do for a Democratic ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Biden\u2019s close advisers are still high on the idea of Warren as a running mate, whoever tops the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cElizabeth Warren is really a great leader, and someone who is dynamic and articulate,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cIf you listen to what she says, it\u2019s on point, it\u2019s factual, it\u2019s thoughtful. I think she would add a lot to Hillary\u2019s ticket, to every ticket. The most important thing is governing. Warren is someone you\u2019d like to have by your side when you\u2019re making these tough decisions.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his part, Sanders seems ambivalent about being the vice presidential nominee on a ticket headed by a candidate he\u2019s relentlessly portrayed as a puppet of the moneyed elites; he\u2019s continued to attack Clinton\u2019s Wall Street fundraising while leaving open the possibility of rejoining the fold after the final primary ballots are cast next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Sanders\u2019 senior strategist, Tad Devine, told POLITICO the campaign was open to the idea of joining a ticket with Clinton \u2014 and Sanders, earlier this week, declined to rule it out, using virtually the same language as Warren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cRight now, we are focused on the next five weeks of winning the Democratic nomination,\u201d Sanders told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cIf that does not happen, we are going to fight as hard as we can on the floor of the Democratic convention to make sure that we have a progressive platform that the American people will support. Then, after that, certainly Secretary &lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and I can sit down and talk and see where we go from there.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 09:23:29 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>akarni@politico.com (Annie Karni)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-223104</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Bernie Sanders, the Zombie Candidate</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-primary-campaign-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-2004-lessons-kerry-dean-edwards-gephardt-213884</link>\n      <description>It\u2019s already over, and now he\u2019s just causing havoc.

The transition from contender to gracious supporter of the nominee isn\u2019t easy for any presidential candidate, but he needs to make it, and soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know Sanders isn\u2019t going to win the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination; Hillary Clinton has amassed more than 92 percent&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;of the delegates needed to secure the nomination, and she\u2019ll easily pick up the rest. So right now, Sanders\u2019 campaign is the walking dead: a zombie. And having worked for John Kerry during the slugfest of the 2004 primaries, I\u2019ve seen up close how much damage this sort of prolonged &amp;quot;zombie&amp;quot; candidacy can inflict on the eventual nominee\u2014and what\u2019s ultimately at stake for the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t claim that the dragged-out primary made the difference in November 2004; the race came down to the wire, and big forces\u2014including post-9/11 anxiety and \u201c&lt;a href=\"http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/2004/any-questions\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/2004/any-questions\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Swift Boat\u201d smears&lt;/a&gt;\u2014loomed large. But in presidential campaigns, the one resource that\u2019s never renewable is time. Zombie candidates can\u2019t win the nomination, but they squander vast amounts of time and slowly chip away at the prohibitive front-runner. Some of the damage is obvious\u2014the endless series of public dents in the candidate\u2019s reputation; some are subtle, noticeable in ways that perhaps only political operatives can appreciate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s an article of faith in politics that competitive primaries create stronger nominees, and I witnessed this firsthand as well. Kerry grew immensely as a candidate in the course of being tested by rivals from Dick Gephardt to Howard Dean; ditto for Barack Obama in 2008. Healthy competition is a good thing. But continuing to contest a primary after your path to victory disappears is not healthy; it actively hinders your would-be partisan ally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before spring began in 2004, it was clear that the process had produced a nominee. But deep into primary season, after a winning streak that knocked out most of our opponents, the campaigns of Dean, Wesley Clark and John Edwards lingered on. Even as they were on life support, their organizations took needlessly hard shots at Kerry at the same time Republicans were inundating the presumptive Democratic nominee with a daily barrage of attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By February 15, 2004, 16 statewide caucuses and primaries had completed, and  Edwards had carried only his birth state, South Carolina. That evening, Edwards used a debate in Wisconsin to hammer  Kerry on trade and spending. When Kerry, who had won 14 of the first 16 contests, started to talk about taking on President George W. Bush in the general election, Edwards pounced. \u201cNot so fast, John Kerry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a whole group of primaries coming up, and I, for one, intend to fight.\u201d Just north of one week later,  Bush gleefully made his first public speech attacking Kerry and kicked off the general election with biting television ads\u2014all while our campaign was hunkered down fighting in Super Tuesday states that we knew wouldn\u2019t be competitive in the general election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Super Tuesday, we won nine of the 10 states\u2014and spent plenty of money to do it. But that\u2019s what you have to do when doomed primary opponents don\u2019t accept reality. All the while, the Bush campaign publicized the Democratic attacks on Kerry; they were overjoyed to receive a liberal version of in-kind contributions to the Republican National Committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was something surreal about knowing that doomed campaigns of fellow Democrats were aggressively peddling opposition research, and that candidates whose fates had been sealed were still &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/02/01/dean-attacks-kerry-on-special-interests/8d1e7311-c832-4c5e-81ef-53f72ebfd369/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;publicly labeling&lt;/a&gt; their party\u2019s soon-to-be nominee as \u201cthe handmaiden of special interests.\u201d We were forced to respond. We were forced to spend limited money on the airwaves, buying time to run ads that would be long forgotten by November\u2014all while an incumbent Republican president stockpiled resources. We were less than four years removed from watching Ralph Nader and disaffected liberals throw an election to Bush, yet these flailing campaigns seemed incapable of resisting the danger of repeating that mistake by damaging their own standard-bearer. Political campaigns can do many things, but they cannot recover lost time. The friendly-fire attacks compounded the difficulty of responding effectively to the parallel attacks made by Republicans. It postponed the work of unifying the Democratic Party and absorbing our rivals\u2019 best operatives into our apparatus. It wasted campaign funds that could\u2019ve been put to better use in the general election. And it stalled our ability to shift the campaign\u2019s schedule and resources into an effort that could win the presidency, instead of one that would merely follow a nominating calendar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, continued competition after the match was essentially over didn\u2019t improve our campaign or candidate. It hurt the Democratic Party. Kerry would\u2019ve benefited from a decent interval to recharge his batteries, reset for the fall, and focus the campaign entirely on the Republican attack machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, with Donald Trump all but guaranteed to be the Republican nominee, the general election electorate is beginning to tune in. At a time when voters could be comparing Trump and Secretary Clinton, the presumptive nominees, they\u2019re instead seeing Clinton take shrapnel not just from the Republicans, but from Sanders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders has a stake in this. I hope he sees it. Sanders needs to think long and hard about the big cost of criticizing the now-prohibitive Democratic front-runner. He didn\u2019t set out to become Trump\u2019s best ghostwriter for the general election, but that is the role continued attacks on Clinton risk earning him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: Clinton is a crisper candidate than she was a year ago, a credit to her sparring partner from Vermont. She has upped her game. But at this point, it would be better for the Democratic Party if Clinton could focus on the asymmetric political warfare to come from Trump\u2014which she could do right now if she didn\u2019t have to maintain a second front battling a pesky primary opponent who cannot win. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without math or momentum on his side, isn\u2019t it better for Sanders to finish the campaign as a happy warrior and build a long-term movement for campaign finance reform? Or would he rather be remembered for damaging the Democratic standard-bearer when we have to crush Trump and win back the Senate in November? The best path for Sanders is also the best path for his newly adopted political party. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders has already changed the political conversation in 2016. Whether wage inequality, middle-class pain, or the distorting role of money in politics, he has made a mark. But if the last wheezes of Sanders\u2019 2016 efforts echo those of Jerry Brown\u2019s campaign in 1992\u2014i.e., attacking a Clinton personally instead of advocating core issues with a positive agenda\u2014the issues that Sanders cares about will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s the alternative for Sanders? If he is serious about creating lasting political change\u2014and I believe he is\u2014he should start a national movement to drive money out of politics. Sanders could harness his enormous grass-roots fundraising network and the cash it has stockpiled\u2014and can replenish repeatedly\u2014to elect candidates from the White House to the Congress to the state and local levels who are committed to repealing &lt;i&gt;Citizens United&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could target Senate Republicans in states like New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, inspiring voters there to \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d and defeat the incumbents. He could hold those new senators accountable and enlist them in his quest to rid big money from the political system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could help Hillary Clinton win big and sweep in a Democratic majority in the Senate. He could become a powerful committee chairman. He could return to the next Senate as one of its most influential players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for an Independent socialist from Vermont who started this campaign as an asterisk, that\u2019s a political revolution in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 09:24:34 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>David Wade</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-primary-campaign-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-2004-lessons-kerry-dean-edwards-gephardt-213884</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>6 Alternate Realities That Could Have Stopped Trump</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/stop-donald-trump-2016-gop-alternate-reality-213887</link>\n      <description>If only we could go back in time and tweak a few things, the GOP might be on a different path today.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;\u201cFor of all the sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: It might have been.\u201d Maybe it was watching a grinning Donald Trump munch on a taco salad\u2014that &lt;a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/05/05/we_are_now_fact_checking_donald_trumps_lunch_trump_tweets_patronizing_cinco_de_mayo_image_reporters_rush_to_confirm_if_trump_towers_serves_taco_bowls/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;may or may not have&lt;/a&gt; been bought, as he claimed, at the Trump Grill\u2014to win the Hispanic vote. Or maybe it was Sarah Palin &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/08/politics/sarah-palin-vice-president-donald-trump/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;discussing&lt;/a&gt; whether or not she would accept the vice presidency again. One just can\u2019t help shake the lingering feeling\u2014at least around D.C.\u2014that none of this was supposed to have happened. That somehow the country slipped into a vortex, where one mistaken move veered the nation from its intended path into an alternate Trump-branded reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was Donald Trump\u2019s hostile takeover of the GOP truly destined? Or were there events that might have changed 2016 altogether, if only we could go back in time and put right what once went wrong? Time to &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Leap\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Quantum Leap&lt;/a&gt; the heck out of this election cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DESTINATION:  February 4, 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCATION:  New York, New York&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MISSION: Avert ABC\u2019s decision to put Chris Christie in New Hampshire debate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that the rather last-minute decision to include Chris Christie, then dwelling at the bottom of many polls, onto the main stage of the Republican debate in New Hampshire would change history? But it did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countless Republicans still wonder how the primaries might have played out had Chris Christie not decided to turn Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign into his own personal Alderaan, refusing to relent until he blew the promising Floridian\u2019s candidacy into a billion bits over the snow-covered hills of New Hampshire. Had Christie not been on stage that night, leaving Rubio to recycle robotically his favorite clich&amp;eacute;s without incident, there\u2019s every reason to believe that then-surging Rubio might have finished at the top of the first-in-the-nation primary. John Kasich, who absorbed a flood of panicked Rubio investors, would not have had the surprise 2nd place \u201cvictory\u201d that fueled his campaign for months longer than it deserved, like an out-of-date Volkswagen puttering across the country on fumes. Instead, as history seemed to have intended, the Ohio governor would have joined rivals Jeb Bush and Christie in an early exit from the race, giving Rubio a chance to consolidate the establishment vote and head to South Carolina with a stronger head of steam. It was not to be, all because a few senior executives at ABC decided Chris Christie needed a break. Maybe there really &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a mainstream media conspiracy to elect Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DESTINATION:  February 1, 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCATION: Des Moines, Iowa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MISSION: Keep Ben Carson from running out of clean clothes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When CNN reported on Iowa caucus night that Ben Carson, after what already was shaping up to be a disappointing finish, was leaving the campaign trail to return home to Florida, most sophisticated political pundits knew what that meant. The esteemed neurosurgeon was calling it quits. Why else would his team announce he was heading home, instead of onward to New Hampshire like everybody else pretending they still had a chance? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this was also the reasonable conclusion some on the Ted Cruz campaign drew, telegraphing this news to their supporters in what was still a close race against Donald Trump. The result was that Carson, who later &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/iowa-caucus-2016-live-updates/2016/02/ben-carson-iowa-caucuses-laundry-218575\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; he was only going home to get fresh shirts, accused the Cruz campaign of deception\u2014a charge that took the Cruz campaign days to shake, and which led Trump to christen his strongest rival with a damaging new nickname: Lyin\u2019 Ted. Cruz &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/ted-cruz-2016-drop-out-presidential-race-indiana-213868\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;never quite got&lt;/a&gt; past the annoying moniker. Carson never got over the slight even after he quit the race for realz. He even endorsed Trump, &lt;a href=\"http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/heres-real-reason-ben-carson-endorsing-trump/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;one could surmise&lt;/a&gt;, because of it. Now a man who Trump himself once compared to a psychopath\u2014\u201che says he went after his mother and wanted to hit her in the head with a hammer,\u201d Trump noted\u2014is being &lt;a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/05/04/ben-carson-trump-selection-committee/iGamSPwKOnodkuvWNkFLiO/story.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;tasked&lt;/a&gt; with helping select the next vice president of the United States. If only someone had packed the man enough clean clothes in Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Destination: January 30, 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location: Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission: Talk Mitt Romney into the 2016 race&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, many tried. But for whatever reason Mitt Romney passed on a third presidential run. On the one hand, his decision made sense. He didn\u2019t want to go down in history as a Jeopardy question\u2014\u201cThis former Massachusetts governor ran for\u2014and lost\u2014the presidency three cycles in a row\u201d\u2014or scramble with Jeb Bush for loose change in the Koch Brothers\u2019 couch cushions. Yet in hindsight the millionaire investor might have been the best candidate able to confront Trump where he was strongest\u2014his appeal as a successful business tycoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the debate stage, Romney could have undercut Trump\u2019s message that he was the only job creator in the race who knew how to run a private company. He could have lambasted Trump\u2014when it mattered\u2014with the authority of someone who\u2019d won broad support from his party only four years earlier. Instead, Romney was left giving Trump a &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/03/politics/mitt-romney-presidential-race-speech/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;tongue lashing&lt;/a&gt; that came too late, and only served to show that Trump was in fact the enemy of the Washington establishment, just as Trump had been telling his supporters all along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DESTINATION:  October 31, 2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCATION:  Atlantic City, New Jersey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MISSION: Stop the \u201chug\u201d&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is any one moment in his political life Chris Christie would like to take back\u2014other than the time he &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/03/03/chris-christie-stare-donald-trump-president-pkg-moos-erin.cnn\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;looked like&lt;/a&gt; he was taking part in a hostage video behind Donald Trump\u2014it\u2019s the fulsome praise and overall best-buddy chumminess he showed Barack Obama on that Halloween day in 2012. Expressing gratitude to the president for the federal government\u2019s assistance to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy, Christie &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/us/politics/after-embrace-of-obama-chris-christie-woos-a-wary-gop.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;went&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too far for Republican\u2019s comfort, praising the president repeatedly as \u201coutstanding,\u201d and \u201cincredibly supportive.\u201d That this came six days before Obama\u2019s close election against Mitt Romney looked like treason. (If you\u2019re a democrat, imagine Bill Clinton flying to Indiana days before that pivotal primary and lauding Donald Trump as a brilliant visionary.) The Christie-Obama moment became so infamous to conservatives that people still &lt;a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/01/inside-hug-gate-the-online-meme-that-chris-christie-cant-shake/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;remember&lt;/a&gt;, incorrectly, that the two men hugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the treasonous embrace of Obama that permanently sank Christie, already suspect as a blue-state governor, in the esteems of the GOP rank-and-file. (It damaged him with conservatives far more than the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal that followed.) If someone could go back in time and take a sharpie to every fulsome adjective Christie awarded to Obama in that October 31 speech, then Christie might very well have entered 2016 the GOP front-runner and likely nominee, instead of the guy Trump bosses around at rallies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DESTINATION:   Anytime, 2011 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCATION: Miami, Florida&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MISSION:  Reverse Jeb Bush\u2019s decision not to run for president in 2012 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the final outcome, Jeb\u2019s entry into the 2012 race against Obama would likely have changed a great deal. Had he defeated Obama, 2016 would have been his re-election bid. Had he lost, he probably would have been as reluctant as Mitt Romney to try again just four years later. And Jeb!\u2019s skipping a 2016 run would have saved a lot of people a lot of money, freed up other younger contenders to get support and contributions, prevented a good man from being fileted daily by a gleeful Trump, and staved off more damage to the Bush family brand in and out of the GOP. In any event, 2012 was Jeb\u2019s time, which even he &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2012/06/jeb-bush-2012-was-my-time-to-run-077137\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;later admitted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DESTINATION:  July 4, 1776&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCATION: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MISSION: Give America\u2019s Founders a glimpse of the future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uh, maybe we ought to think this thing through a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 22:45:17 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>(Matt Latimer)</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/stop-donald-trump-2016-gop-alternate-reality-213887</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Ben Rhodes and the Tough Sell of Obama's Foreign Policy</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/ben-rhodes-nytimes-tough-sell-of-obamas-foreign-policy-213883</link>\n      <description>The Times profile of an overweening aide missed the substance of his beliefs, and why they've been so easily vilified.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the White House walked back deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes\u2019 impolitic, contemptuous &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/magazine/the-aspiring-novelist-who-became-obamas-foreign-policy-guru.html?_r=2\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;quotes&lt;/a&gt; in the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;about the foreign policy establishment (\u201cThe Blob\u201d) and the Washington media (\u201c27-year-olds\u201d who \u201cliterally know nothing\u201d). Press secretary Josh Earnest said he\u2019s confident Rhodes \u201cwould say it differently if he had the chance.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, Rhodes did have the chance, when I interviewed him at length in March for a &lt;span class=\"cms-magazineStyles-smallCaps\"&gt;Politico Magazine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/narrative-message-media-president-barack-obama-administration-communications-213830\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; about President Obama\u2019s communications problems. He was a bit less impolitic, but just as contemptuous. His main thesis was that Obama has struggled to communicate about global affairs because elites and reporters cling to outdated bumper-sticker ideas about American power, ignoring the lessons of the disastrous Iraq War. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a reckoning with the magnitude of that error,\u201d he told me. His main theme, a bit ironic in light of his self-aggrandizing comments to Times writer David Samuels, was the importance of humility in foreign policy, especially regarding the geopolitical Augean Stable that is the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe default view in Washington is that if there\u2019s a challenge in the Middle East, the U.S. has to solve it,\u201d Rhodes said in our interview. \u201cOur basic point has been, no, sorry, we learned the opposite lesson from Iraq. It\u2019s not that more U.S. military engagement will stabilize the Middle East.  &lt;i&gt;It\u2019s that we can\u2019t do this&lt;/i&gt;.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The furor over the weird Rhodes profile is inside-Beltway-baseball, but his foreign policy ideas are truly important. That\u2019s because, as Samuels reports, Rhodes has a true mind meld with Obama, which is why he\u2019s so influential in the White House despite his remarkably thin foreign policy credentials. Uproars over presidential aides are generally about the president rather than the aide; what Rhodes thinks wouldn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t think the way Obama thinks. Writers &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/ben-rhodes-and-the-retailing-of-the-iran-deal/481893/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;who know&lt;/a&gt; way more than I do about foreign policy believe Samuels twisted the facts to make Rhodes sound like Obama\u2019s Svengali\u2014and to make the selling of Obama\u2019s Iran deal, which Samuels opposes, sound perfidious\u2014but Rhodes clearly shares Obama\u2019s outlook. His beliefs reflect the Obama Doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuels seemed less interested in the substance of that doctrine than in the notion that Rhodes is a talented dilettante, an aspiring fiction writer who thinks he\u2019s living a Don DeLillo novel. He portrays Rhodes as a modern-day Henry Kissinger who provides similarly bloodless Realpolitik advice, the only purported difference being that Rhodes reflexively schemes to keep America out of foreign wars instead of reflexively scheming to get America into foreign wars. But that\u2019s a big difference! And while it may have been ideologically convenient for Samuels to portray Rhodes as a brilliant salesman who snookered America, Slate\u2019s Fred Kaplan noted that \u201cif Rhodes is as powerful and skillful and clever as this article claims, the question should have been asked: Why does Obama\u2019s foreign policy have such a lousy reputation?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the question I kept asking Rhodes for my communications story; his title, after all, is deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. And his consistent answer was that Obama\u2019s interpreters\u2014foreign policy elites and D.C. journalists\u2014promote unwise ideas about America\u2019s role in the world, especially in the Middle East. It\u2019s been 18 years since I was a 27-year-old reporter, and I\u2019m not a literal know-nothing about foreign policy, but I\u2019m no expert, so Rhodes gave me a kind of Obama Doctrine for Dummies that was notably missing from the Times Magazine opus. Obama recently gave a more nuanced explication of his worldview to Jeffrey Goldberg of &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;\u2014a great reporter who was slandered in the Samuels piece as a shill\u2014but Rhodes gave me the Cliff Notes version, with three major points that show where the White House is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Middle East is an intractable mess that U.S. power cannot fix.&lt;/b&gt; Samuels suggested the White House has overlearned the lessons of Iraq, but Rhodes believes Washington has underlearned the lessons of Iraq. And the key lesson is that instability in that region is a fact to accept, not a challenge to overcome. The situations in Syria or Yemen or Iraq itself may be awful, but it\u2019s folly to expect a muscular U.S. intervention to make those situations not-awful, even though Washington inevitably judges the president according to the messes on his watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe fundamental problem in the public debate,\u201d Rhodes said, \u201cis the presumption we can fix these places and impose satisfying outcomes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Rhodes said, it\u2019s true there have been terror attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan now that fewer than 15,000 American troops are stationed there, and they routinely inspire calls for renewed U.S. engagement. But there were also terror attacks when 150,000 American troops were stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Similarly, Obama came under intense pressure to take out Syrian President Bashar  Assad, who used chemical weapons even after Obama called that an unacceptable \u201cred line,\u201d but Rhodes argued that U.S. diplomatic pressure ultimately got Assad to give up his chemical weapons, while military action could have been self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf we had taken out Assad, what happens the next day?\u201d Rhodes asked. \u201cWe just fought a war in Iraq for a decade. We know how that turns out. People say the president is creating a straw man with that comparison, but Syria is right next door, with a similar sectarian division and even less resources. It\u2019s not a straw man.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious question, if Obama is so skeptical of grand solutions and military interventions in the Middle East, is why he helped oust dictators in Egypt and Libya. To my surprise, Rhodes suggested the White House now regrets its meddling, which ultimately helped pave the way for a military coup in Egypt and chaos in Libya. In retrospect, he thinks the administration should have been less optimistic about the Arab Spring, and more realistic about its own ability to shape an inherently turbulent region with deep religious schisms and few democratic traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cLook, those actions did not succeed the way we hoped,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cAgain, it demonstrates the limits of America\u2019s capability to dictate events in the Middle East. That\u2019s not always a satisfying narrative in Washington, but it\u2019s reality.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Middle East mess distracts the U.S. from problems it actually can fix.&lt;/b&gt; Rhodes told me that when Obama took office, \u201cforeign policy was dominated by Iraq, Afghanistan and terrorism,\u201d with the nation pouring $10 billion a month into wars that were creating horrific carnage without advancing American interests. \u201cThere are questions of bandwidth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re consumed by the Middle East, you can\u2019t fix climate change or engage Asia.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of American non-military leadership that excites Rhodes, and presumably excites Obama\u2014the global climate deal in Paris, the \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia exemplified by the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement, the coordination of the global fight against the Ebola virus, the opening to Cuba that the Times Magazine profile barely mentioned, even though Rhodes helped negotiate it in secret. Even the Iran deal is more about Obama\u2019s commitment to nuclear non-proliferation than any chessboard vision for defusing tensions in the Middle East. The basic theory is to focus on areas in which progress is possible\u2014peace talks in Colombia, climate talks with China, an opening to Myanmar\u2014rather than the rift between Sunnis and Shiites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe president is positioning the U.S. to lead in the places that matter in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThe idea is to avoid getting sucked into ground wars in the Middle East, engage with emerging regions like Asia and Latin America, and deal with emerging issues like climate and non-proliferation through diplomacy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His implication was that the Middle East is not a place that matters in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century, but Rhodes said the White House isn\u2019t abandoning the region, just \u201ctrying to cabin our engagement so it doesn\u2019t lead to an overextension.\u201d (That was the first time I ever heard the word \u201ccabin\u201d used as a verb.) Obama has stepped up the use of drone warfare and special operations to target terrorists. He\u2019s bombing ISIL in Syria, and trying to build a coalition to deal with ISIL in Iraq and Libya. The killing of Osama bin Laden, Rhodes noted, served as its own communications strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, though, Rhodes and Obama wish the media focused less on the Middle East and the related issue of terrorism. That\u2019s not just because they believe the danger of terrorism is consistently overhyped, although they do believe that. It\u2019s not just because they believe threat inflation helps terrorists spread fear, although they believe that as well. Rhodes worries that the hype cycle ratchets up demand for misguided Iraq War-style responses, and Obama apparently shares that concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dumb fear-driven discourse creates pressure for dumb fear-driven policies. &lt;/b&gt;At a news conference after last year\u2019s terror attacks in Paris, a CNN reporter\u2014considerably older than 27\u2014asked Obama: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we take out the bastards?\u201d The president was irritated, since he had just tried to explain his strategy against ISIL, and Rhodes still sounded irritated when I talked to him four months later. He scoffed at the idea of a magical solution that could instantly obliterate ISIL and its sympathizers in Syria, Iraq and Libya, not to mention France and Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd what if we did take out the bastards?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d have to occupy the ungoverned space in the Middle East, and there would be an insurgency, and we\u2019d get stuck in a sectarian conflict. But that\u2019s complicated. People just want to take out the bastards. The president\u2019s strength is that he understands the complexity of the world, but it\u2019s hard to compete with \u2018we need to make the desert glow\u2019 or \u2018we just need more leadership.\u2019 Black and white is easier to convey than nuance.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one time Rhodes went off the record during our chat was after he mentioned Obama\u2019s concern that \u201ca cascade of fear-mongering\u201d was debasing America\u2019s foreign policy debate. But he did suggest on the record that the amped-up hysteria of cable news, as well as belligerent chest-thumping and Muslim-bashing by Republican candidates, contributed to a climate inhospitable to rational decisions. \u201cWe have to guard against reverting back to the Iraq War mind-set,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Rhodes, the ultimate example of America\u2019s debased foreign policy debate was the widespread mockery of Obama\u2019s suggestion that his first principle was \u201cDon\u2019t Do Stupid Shit.\u201d Critics saw that as a pitifully modest aspiration for a superpower, but Rhodes asked: \u201cWhy would we want to do stupid shit?\u201d To the White House, of course, the Iraq War, with its immense cost in blood and treasure and America\u2019s standing in the world, is the ultimate example of stupid shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One could argue that Rhodes\u2019 decision to cooperate with Samuels, who has publicly &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-new-york-times-magazine-david-samuels-ben-rhodes-iran-nuclear-deal-213880\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for Israel to attack Iran, was pretty stupid, too, thrusting himself into the unforgiving Washington &amp;quot;echo chamber&amp;quot; for which he harbors such evident disdain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Times Magazine, Samuels carved up Rhodes and his boss, suggesting that they use Iraq as an all-purpose retort to all criticism, that their monomaniacal fear of another Iraq is its own kind of blinkered thinking, that their fatalistic notions about the Middle East have become an excuse for inaction in the face of hundreds of thousands of deaths and a monumental refugee crisis. And Rhodes came off as an arrogant jerk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he told me in March, it's easy to lose control of the narrative in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get people to focus on substance,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cAnd the optics of this stuff are a real challenge.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 23:56:42 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>mgrunwald@politico.com (Michael Grunwald)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/ben-rhodes-nytimes-tough-sell-of-obamas-foreign-policy-213883</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>The Tiny Scottish Village That Spawned Trump</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-scottish-village-scotland-mother-213882</link>\n      <description>He doesn\u2019t talk much about his mother\u2019s ancestral home, but people here still talk about him.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The village of Tong, on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis, has a calm, unhurried air. On a blustery weekday afternoon, a pair of men in gum boots herd sheep off the grass verges by the side of a narrow country road. The air is thick with the smell of fresh seaweed. The few dozen houses here are silhouetted against fields of peat colored in soft yellows, browns and greens. In the near distance is Stornoway, Lewis\u2019 only town and the main source of jobs on the island. The Scottish mainland is 40 miles, and a two-hour ferry-ride, away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a population barely in three digits, Tong (pronounced \u201ctongue\u201d) might seem a world away from the glassy opulence of Trump Tower or the gold-leafed walls of Mar-a-Lago, but it is to this flat, marshy land that Donald Trump traces his roots. His mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was raised in the village, along with generations before her. She spoke almost exclusively in Scots Gaelic before leaving for a new life in the United States at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the part of Trump\u2019s heritage he usually talks about. On the campaign trail, the candidate has by and large avoided telling the immigrant story of his own immediate family, speaking instead of building walls and banning Muslims. When he does bring up the subject, it tends to be in reference to his father, Fred\u2014the original builder&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;of the Trump real estate empire in New York whose parents immigrated from Germany more than a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in some ways, Trump owes just as much to the side of his family that came over more recently, the MacLeods of Scotland. Local records suggest his ancestors here might be the source of Trump\u2019s first name and the original reddish tint of his hair. One grandfather was also a businessman and a local politician. And Trump himself attributes his flamboyance and penchant for entertainment to his Scottish side. \u201cLooking back, I realize now that I got some of my sense of showmanship from my mother,\u201d he writes in his memoir &lt;i&gt;The Art of the Deal&lt;/i&gt;. \u201cShe always had a flair for the dramatic and the grand. She was a very traditional housewife, but she also had a sense of the world beyond her.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the story of the Scottish origins Trump speaks so rarely about?&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;On a bracing April morning, I boarded a twin-prop plane bound for Lewis to find out more about who Trump\u2019s mother was, why she left the Outer Hebrides in the 1930s for a new life in New York and what her native land makes of her famous son today.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;And what I found is that, decades after his mother left Tong, locals here know all about Trump\u2014and are notably reluctant to claim him as one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scotland overall has a complex relationship with Trump. His construction of two luxury golf courses here in the past several years was controversial, and more recently his comments about Muslims earned the scorn of Scotland\u2019s political elite. The people of Lewis in particular maintain a staunchly Calvinist and socially conservative ethic, which makes a thrice-married casino owner turned billionaire showman turned blustery presidential candidate\u2014who has visited the island just twice\u2014something of a black sheep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s lifestyle would not be compatible with his background on the island,\u201d Reverend James Maciver, a minister who grew up near the MacLeod home in Tong and is a friend of the family, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he has made it big in financial terms\u2014it\u2019s how he has done it. It\u2019s the kind of devil-may-care attitude. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens to people as long as he gets what he wants. That doesn\u2019t sit well with the mentality on the island.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most islanders I spoke with said they view Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy with a mix of wry amusement and embarrassment. An \u201cIsle of Lewis supports Trump for President\u201d Facebook page had 83 likes at the time of writing, but a rival anti-Trump page had more than double that number. The fact that so many here call him by the Scots Gaelic for his first and middle name\u2014\u201cDomhnall Iain,\u201d or Donald John\u2014is a mark of disparagement, not endearment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump might still call Scotland a \u201c&lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/09/donaldtrump.scotland\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;special&lt;/a&gt;\u201d place, and he still golfs here &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/30/europe/trump-turnberry-scotland-golf-resort/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;on occasion&lt;/a&gt;, even since announcing his candidacy. But he\u2019s drifted a long way from the island that, of any other place in the world besides New York, has perhaps the most immediate claim on the potential next president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To find out how this happened, &lt;/b&gt;I first sought to speak with two of Trump\u2019s cousins who still live in Tong. Trump visited them in 2008, and they have appeared in the British press occasionally over the years. But there was one problem: The last person they want to talk about today is Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of those cousins, William and Alasdair Murray, live in the MacLeod family home in Tong, a modest two-story house in grey pebbledash. The white lace curtains that frame the windows tweaked when I knocked on a Tuesday afternoon. William, 76, quickly declined my invitation to speak. \u201cI\u2019m not talking to journalists,\u201d he said with an almost apologetic shake of his head as he slowly closed the door. The response was the same across the street, where another Trump cousin, Calum MacLeod, 68, lives with his wife in a bungalow surrounded by a high hedge: He gave me a grin but then closed the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey are good people, but they are fed up with people asking about Trump,\u201d a local shop owner told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Trump roots lie much deeper than just this generation. I went to meet with Bill Lawson, the foremost expert on Lewis genealogy who has re-constructed more than 30,000 family trees\u2014including Mary Anne MacLeod\u2019s\u2014using registers of births, marriages and deaths, as well as oral history. According to the MacLeod family tree, he explained, all but one of Mary Anne\u2019s grandparents hailed from Tong; the other, her paternal grandfather, Alexander MacLeod, was from the nearby village of Vatisker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Lawson took me back through Trump\u2019s family history, we happened on a surprising discovery: Trump\u2019s great-great grandfather (and Alexander\u2019s father), Alasdair MacLeod, a fisherman born around 1810, was known by everyone as \u201cRuadh,\u201d or \u201cRed,\u201d on account of his hair\u2014perhaps the source of Trump\u2019s own infamous mop (which was more reddish-brown than cornmeal yellow in his younger days). He explained that Lewis was part of Norway until the 13th century. \u201cRed hair is very common on the islands,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cAlmost everyone in the island, you trace back their DNA [and] you come to a Viking.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tong that \u201cRuadh\u201d knew, which subsisted largely on fishing, farming and some weaving, was not an especially hospitable place to live. When vast tracts of Lewis were turned into giant sheep farms in the 1820s, many families were moved from elsewhere on the island to Tong, leading to horrific overcrowding in the village. The situation \u201cbeggars all description,\u201d a land manager from the mainland wrote upon visiting Tong in 1828, &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=At8sAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;amp;q=%22beggars+all+description%22\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Scottish historian James Hunter. \u201cIt is worse than anything I ever saw in Donegal [in Ireland] where I always considered human wretchedness to have reached its very acme.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-violent \u201cland raids\u201d soon broke out: Lewis men believed they had a right to work on estates given over to absentee landlords for sheep herding, and would march onto that land in protest, marking out farms and planting crops there. The villagers of Tong were considered among the most radical on the island. The famous Scottish socialist firebrand John Maclean, who visited the area after World War I, saw it as a hotbed of insurrection. A collection of Stornoway slang published in the 1990s still referred to the Tong\u2019s residents as \u201cBolshiveeks.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s ancestors were farmers but also fishermen\u2014a profession that carried its own dangers given the unpredictable waters around the Minch, the strait between the Outer Hebrides and the Scottish Highlands. (The week I visited Lewis, a local fisherman was missing after a life raft had failed to inflate properly when his ship sank.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, according to Lawson\u2019s research, \u201cRuadh\u201d lost his life at sea around 1847. Donald Smith, Trump\u2019s great grandfather on his maternal grandmother\u2019s side\u2014and perhaps his namesake\u2014met the same fate. The British press &lt;a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stornoway-tragedy-of-trumps-ancestor-t8q8995kp\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that in 1868, Smith was fishing off Vatisker Point when a squall overturned his boat. The 34-year-old\u2019s body was never found, but at Brevig harbor, just a few miles from Tong, Smith\u2019s name is listed on a memorial cairn, along with the names of dozens of others who have died in the swash-flecked water beyond the harbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Smith\u2019s death, his widow, Mary Smith, was left to manage the family croft, a small farm holding, and bring up their children. The youngest in the family, also named Mary, was Trump\u2019s grandmother. Her eventual husband, Malcolm MacLeod, may be the source of some of Trump\u2019s entrepreneurial drive. Malcolm was not just a fisherman and a farmer\u2014he also set up a shop and post office in Tong, according to valuation rolls at the National Records of Scotland published earlier this year. According to &lt;a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stornoway-tragedy-of-trumps-ancestor-t8q8995kp\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;British press reports&lt;/a&gt;, he turned the role into a political one, serving as a county councilor on Lewis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The immigrant story of Trump\u2019s mother,&lt;/b&gt; Mary Anne, has been told in brief by some of Trump\u2019s biographers over the years. Details about her early life on Lewis are sparse, however, not least from Trump himself, who mentions his mother on just a handful of pages of &lt;i&gt;The Art of the Deal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Lawson and other local historians suggested that Mary Anne likely had a difficult childhood, judging by Tong\u2019s history. Born to Malcolm and Mary on May 10, 1912, Mary Anne and her nine older siblings almost certainly would have lived in a narrow \u201cblack house\u201d\u2014so-called because of the soot that coated the thick stone walls\u2014with a low, thatched roof. Tong\u2019s black houses are all gone today, in some cases replaced by large piles built on oil money from the North Sea (or, in the case of the MacLeod family plot, a more modern home). But a century ago they were still the most common family structure. Each member of the household would have been expected to help run the house and work the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most everyone else in Tong, the MacLeods belonged to Scotland\u2019s Free Church, a Calvinist congregation with roots in the Scottish Reformation. The local church had a major bearing on everyday life in the village. That appears to have been true in what was perhaps&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the defining moment of Mary Anne\u2019s young life\u2014a family scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Scottish Sun&lt;/i&gt; has reported, and Lawson confirmed to me, that&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;in 1920, Mary Anne\u2019s older sister Catherine fell pregnant when she was unmarried. What the Presbyterian Church&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;termed \u201cantenuptial fornication\u201d was seen as the ultimate disgrace at the time; regardless of whether the result of rape, incest or pre-marital sex, the woman was held solely responsible for such a pregnancy. According to the &lt;i&gt;Sun&lt;/i&gt;, Catherine moved to the mainland to finish her pregnancy at her parents\u2019 urging, before returning briefly to Lewis with her child, Annie, whom she left with her parents to raise. In &lt;a href=\"http://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;1921&lt;/a&gt;, Catherine set off for a new life in America, where she eventually married a Scots-born butler in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s hardly surprising that a young woman would choose to abandon Lewis at that time. By the 1920s, the local island economy was in tatters, the herring industry decimated by unlikely twin blows of the Russian revolution and American prohibition. (Salted Hebridean fish had been a popular bar snack.) Successive harvests had failed, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a young woman on Lewis, the prospects of marriage\u2014the only way out of the family\u2014were very limited. \u201cThere was not much opportunity to meet beyond the village,\u201d Lawson explained to me. \u201cThe big marriage season was in the summer, when you put the sheep put for grazing on the common land, and that was a place for mixing. But you tended to marry close to you.\u201d What\u2019s more, during World War I, thousands of Outer Hebrides men died, the highest per capita toll of anywhere in the United Kingdom, as the Lewis-based author John MacLeod (of no known Trump relation)&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/When-Heard-Bell-Loss-Iolaire/dp/184158858X\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;has written&lt;/a&gt;. On New Year\u2019s Day 1919 alone, more than 200 Lewismen died when the &lt;i&gt;HMS Iolaire&lt;/i&gt; ran aground just a mile from Stornoway harbor. Many more perished in the subsequent flu pandemic (which some fire-and-brimstone Presbyterian preachers blamed on the moral failings of their flock). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When government promises of land for returning servicemen were not kept, emigration\u2014long a facet of Lewis life\u2014increased. Thousands of Lewis residents left in the 1920s, mainly to Canada and the Eastern seaboard of the United States. Having seen Catherine escape, and perhaps wary of being left to care for her parents in their dotage, Mary Anne followed her sister, leaving Lewis for New York in 1930 aboard the Scottish-built &lt;i&gt;Transylvania&lt;/i&gt;, according to Ellis Island records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this stage, the story gets murky. Numerous newspaper reports over the years have described Mary Anne as being \u201con holiday\u201d when Catherine took her to the party in New York where she met real estate developer Fred C. Trump. (By then, Mary Anne \u201cspoke English with a heavy burr,\u201d Gwenda Blair writes in her book &lt;i&gt;The Trumps&lt;/i&gt;.) But islanders scoff at the idea of a young Lewis woman taking a sojourn on the other side of the Atlantic. \u201cShe would never have had the money for that,\u201d says Kenny MacIver, an avuncular Gaelic-language journalist who grew up a few miles from Tong. \u201cMy father never had a holiday. We simply didn\u2019t understand what the concept was.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More likely, Mary Anne left for New York looking for work, possibly in domestic service (the most common employment for young women who left Lewis), met Trump senior and returned briefly to Tong before marrying. Shipping records show that she arrived again in the United States in 1934, by then aged 22. She was wed two years later, and would have five children with her husband, Fred: Maryanne, Fred Jr., Elizabeth, Robert and, of course, Donald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Even when she was ensconced in the United States,&lt;/b&gt; Mary Anne, who became a U.S. citizen in &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=PmrwtRTQ3fMC&amp;amp;pg=PA588&amp;amp;dq=gwenda+blair+macleod&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwji6sqNibTMAhUDHB4KHSeMB0MQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=macleod&amp;amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;1942&lt;/a&gt; and was active in &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/09/nyregion/mary-macleod-trump-philanthropist-88.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, regularly returned home to Lewis before her death in New York in 2000, at age 88. Trump\u2019s older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, has visited Lewis dozens of times and is well liked on the island, according to those I spoke to here. In 2015, she gave roughly &lt;a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13213880.Trump_s_sister_donates___160_000_to_Stornoway_care_home/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;$230,000&lt;/a&gt; to a care home and hospice in Stornoway, in memory of her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But until relatively recently, Donald appeared to have little interest in his Scottish roots. He has only ever visited Lewis &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/09/donaldtrump.scotland\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;, and his&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;public references to his mother\u2019s native land are conspicuous by their absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe family have had a genuine, long-term relationship with here,\u201d Kenny MacIver told me. \u201cDonald? No. Until it was of some use to him, he had no interest.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That \u201cuse\u201d was golf, or the business of it. Most Scots associate Trump not with the fishermen of Lewis but with the two courses he owns in Scotland. In 2008, he announced his intention to open a nearly $1.5 billion golfing complex outside the then-oil rich city of Aberdeen. The course was eventually built, thanks to support from the nationalist-dominated Scottish government in Edinburgh, but not without much protest from local residents. In 2012, when Michael Forbes, a farmer who refused to sell his land to Trump, won a scotch whiskey company\u2019s \u201cTop Scot\u201d award (joining the likes of J. K. Rowling and Andy Murray), Trump responded by &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-20608607\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt; the tribute a \u201cterrible embarrassment to Scotland.\u201d Nonetheless, in 2014, the mogul &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27203208\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; a famous course in Turnberry, south of Glasgow, and branded it in his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a presidential candidate, Trump has fallen out rather spectacularly with the Scottish establishment. In 2015, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, &lt;a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-strips-donald-trump-of-scottish-ambassador-role-a6766786.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;withdrew&lt;/a&gt; Trump\u2019s membership in GlobalScot, an international business network, after his comments about barring Muslims from entering the United States. Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen stripped Trump of an honorary degree for the same reason. And, as a result of its owner\u2019s remarks, the Trump Turnberry course is &lt;a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/donald-trumps-turnberry-golf-club-to-no-longer-host-the-open-tournament-amid-anger-over-a6771086.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;no longer in contention&lt;/a&gt; to host the British Open. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has some support in Scotland still. In April, he penned a &lt;a href=\"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/editors-picks/886208/donald-trump-exclusive-pj-column-full-scotland-will-help-become-president/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; headlined \u201cHow Scotland Will Help Me Become President,\u201d for the &lt;i&gt;Press and Journal&lt;/i&gt;, an Aberdeen-based newspaper, which happens to be edited by the husband of an executive vice president of Trump International Golf Links, Scotland. When he first sought to build the Aberdeen course, Trump wrote, \u201cthe people of Scotland were testing me to see just how serious I was\u2014just like the citizens in the United States have done about my race for the White House.\u201d But now: \u201cScotland has already been won\u2014and so will the United States.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Trump last visited his mother\u2019s birthplace, in June 2008, he boasted of his Scottish-ness, but to people here, the visit came across as little more than a flashy stunt. A Boeing 727 with \u201cTRUMP\u201d emblazoned in gold across the fuselage touched down on the blustery asphalt at the Stornoway airport. \u201cI think this land is special,\u201d Trump &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/09/donaldtrump.scotland\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told reporters&lt;/a&gt;. \u201cI think Scotland is special, and I wanted to do something special for my mother.\u201d He visited Tong, and spent less than two minutes with his cousins inside his maternal homestead, the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; reported at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left the island, back in the comfort of his private plane, within a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 10:28:59 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Peter Geoghegan</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-scottish-village-scotland-mother-213882</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>How the New York Times Magazine Botched Its Iran Story</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-new-york-times-magazine-david-samuels-ben-rhodes-iran-nuclear-deal-213880</link>\n      <description>None of us was taking the Obama administration\u2019s word for it on the Iran nuclear deal.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A devious president and his top aides trick the nation into a dangerous foreign entanglement with the help of a gullible press corps and complicit experts. George W. Bush and war with Iraq? No, Barack Obama and diplomacy with Iran. At least according to David Samuels\u2019 &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/magazine/the-aspiring-novelist-who-became-obamas-foreign-policy-guru.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; in an instantly controversial article for this past Sunday\u2019s &lt;i&gt;New York Times Magazine &lt;/i&gt;about White House adviser Ben Rhodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodes, whom I know, is very talented, but he is no modern-day Rasputin casting a spell over Obama, the press and public. The truth is that Samuels used his access to Rhodes to attack a deal he never liked and publicly campaigned against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his article, Samuels claims Obama was \u201cactively misleading\u201d the public about Iran. He says the president made up a story of how the 2013 election of pragmatic Iranian President Hassan Rouhani created a new opening with Iran. This, so Obama could win \u201cbroad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime.\u201d This, in turn, claims Samuels, allowed Obama to avoid a \u201cdivisive but clarifying debate of the actual policy choices\u201d and eliminate the \u201cfuss about Iran\u2019s nuclear program\u201d so that Obama could pursue his real agenda: \u201ca large-scale disengagement from the Middle East.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every element of this thesis falls apart under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama did not mislead the public about negotiations with Iran. Most of the talks the United States held with Iran under the previous, hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were widely reported. Even the secret talks that opened up the engagement with the more pragmatic Rouhani government were &lt;a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/08/iran-us-nuclear-khamenei-salehi-jcpoa-diplomacy.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; by the dogged reporting of Laura Rozen and others well before the congressional vote last year. And the imagined plot to sell out our Middle East allies to Iran is a common talking point of the far right, without &lt;a href=\"http://lobelog.com/samuels-rhodes-and-the-iran-deal-consider-the-source/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;any supporting evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one of Samuels\u2019 biggest fallacies is his claim that the world\u2019s leading nuclear policy and national security experts were duped by Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser whom Samuels portrays as  a digital Machiavelli spinning gullible reporters and compliant experts into accepting a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuels says this is the only way to explain \u201cthe onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal.\u201d He claims that in the spring of 2015, &amp;quot;legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is utter nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In London, Paris, Berlin and Washington the deal was evaluated on its merits, not on spin. Nor did we wait for the White House to fire the starting gun. Ploughshares Fund, the group I head, began our campaign to shut down Iran\u2019s paths to a bomb six years ago. We helped fund a &lt;a href=\"http://www.ploughshares.org/issues-analysis/article/how-we-won\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; of experts, advocates, faith leaders, military leaders and diplomats who trade views and coordinate efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuels takes a swipe at our work directly, quoting Rhodes as saying,  \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this. \u2026 We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have known Ben Rhodes for over seven years. He is a good man who has served his nation well. I asked him about this quote. He said that he was trying to convey the work the White House did with like-minded groups. \u201cI did not think I was saying\u2014nor do I believe\u2014that you just said what I told you to.\u201d In various meetings, outside experts would exchange views with officials. We would debate, often pushing the officials to modify their position. In the end, experts supported this deal because it was a damn good deal. We worked tirelessly to get it adopted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the overwhelming consensus of these experts closely mirrors the views of one key player who described it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\u201c&lt;/b&gt;Without a doubt, the nuclear deal between Iran and the West is a historic turning point. It is a big change in terms of the direction that Iran was headed, and in the way that we saw things. It has many risks, but also presents many opportunities. \u2026 We are still keeping Iran high on our priority lists because we need to monitor its nuclear program. But this is a real change. This is a strategic turning point.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/iran-nuclear-deal-israel/472767/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;words &lt;/a&gt;of Israeli chief of staff General Gadi Eizenkot at a&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFC9pdAaSiM\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; conference&lt;/a&gt; this January. He is the man in charge of Israel\u2019s security. Dozens of Israeli military and intelligence leaders&lt;a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-cirincione/donald-doesnt-know-jack-a_b_9486000.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; agree&lt;/a&gt; with his assessment: This deal makes Israel safer. To claim that Eizenhot and senior Israeli military leaders were swayed by Ben Rhodes\u2019 Twitter account is ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the American experts? Were they seduced by sweet words, clever tweets and briefings at the White House?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuels should know better. He was engaged in these debates back in 2009 when he &lt;a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2009/04/why_israel_will_bomb_iran.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; for bombing Iran, advancing what he said was \u201cthe rational argument for an attack on Iran.\u201d He joined fellow conservatives at a panel  in April 2015 to discuss the topic \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the proposed nuclear deal with Iran?\u201d and &lt;a href=\"http://www.hudson.org/events/1240-what-s-wrong-with-the-proposed-nuclear-deal-with-iran-42015\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that President Obama would \u201cbe responsible for the greatest surge in nuclear proliferation that we\u2019ve seen since the Second World War.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He should know that expert and official advocacy for an agreement to roll back and dismantle Iran\u2019s nuclear program predates the Obama administration and this last set of negotiations. I, personally, have argued for the negotiated dismantlement of Iran\u2019s program for over a decade. Arms Control Association Director Daryl Kimball &lt;a href=\"http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2007_11/focus\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 for a shift in U.S. strategy, including trading sanctions relief for a rollback to the program and engagement in \u201ccomprehensive and sustained direct dialogue with Iran\u2019s leaders.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration\u2019s views on negotiations with Iran were influenced as much by outside experts as the other way around. Different players saw the same opportunities and risks and played their respective roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have long argued, for example, that there was no military solution to this problem. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates &lt;a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/gates-anti-rumsfeld-94609\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 \u201cit would be a strategic calamity to attack [Iran]\u201d and that such an attack would only set back Iran\u2019s program by at most two years. Former senior diplomats and experts in the &lt;a href=\"http://iranprojectfcsny.org \" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Iran Project&lt;/a&gt; held a discrete, back-channel meeting with Iranian counterparts since 2002 to discuss ways to improve relations. They went public with their efforts in 2009 with the signed support of over 50 of the most respected national security experts in the United States, including former national security advisers Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski. Hardly a \u201cfreshly minted\u201d group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in June 2013, just after  Rouhani\u2019s election and long before formal negotiations began, 131 members of Congress \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 &lt;a href=\"http://fcnl.org/issues/iran/diplomacy_with_iran_letter/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;signed a letter&lt;/a&gt; urging Obama \u201cto pursue the potential opportunity presented by Iran\u2019s recent presidential election by reinvigorating U.S. efforts to secure a negotiated nuclear agreement.\u201d They were pushing the president, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Rhodes himself &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/@rhodes44/how-we-advocated-for-the-iran-deal-55e927fa9de5#.69hfbpn2g\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a response to Samuels, \u201cThe outside organizations who did effectively make the case for the Iran deal did so not because we told them to\u2014they did so because they also believed in the merits of the deal.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of expert support for this agreement is too long to include in its entirety. During the summer of 2015 alone, when the Iran debate was at its peak, &lt;a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/pressroom/press-release/2015-18-08/70-Plus-Nuclear-Nonproliferation-Experts-Announce-Support-for-Iran-Nuclear-Deal\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;78 nuclear&lt;/a&gt; nonproliferation experts, &lt;a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/271988995/Statement-by-60-National-Security-Leaders-on-the-Announcement-of-a-Joint-Comprehensive-Plan-of-Action\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;60 national &lt;/a&gt;security experts, &lt;a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/272679222/Letter-on-JCPOA-From-Former-Und-Sec-State-and-US-Ambs-to-Israel-to-House-Leadership\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;five former ambassadors to Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/world/29-us-scientists-praise-iran-nuclear-deal-in-letter-to-obama.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;29 Nobel Prize-winning scientists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/retired-generals-and-admirals-back-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/08/11/bd26f6ae-4045-11e5-bfe3-ff1d8549bfd2_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;36 retired generals&lt;/a&gt; and admirals, over &lt;a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/271773707/Letter-to-the-President-from-over-100-former-American-Ambassadors-on-the-Joint-Comprehensive-Plan-of-Action-on-Iran-s-Nuclear-Program\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;100 former U.S. ambassadors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.supportpeace.org/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;over 500 Iranian-Americans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.ameinu.net/newsroom/press-release/340-rabbis-urge-congress-to-support-nuclear-deal-with-iran/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;340 rabbis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://fcnl.org/issues/iran/christian_leaders_iran_deal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;53 Christian&lt;/a&gt; leaders and &lt;a href=\"http://static.politico.com/46/f2/d3d780be4429be48e3cef9ef3202/former-member-letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;75 former members&lt;/a&gt; of Congress signed letters supporting the historic agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scientists included the physicist who helped design the first hydrogen bomb, and former White House science advisers, many with top secret clearances. The nuclear experts supporting the agreement include former nuclear-weapons inspectors and former U.S. intelligence officials. In fact, there is an &lt;a href=\"https://lobelog.com/overwhelming-expert-consensus-favors-agreement-with-iran/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;overwhelming consensus&lt;/a&gt; among the world\u2019s experts that the agreement is the best and likely the only way to ensure that Iran never builds a bomb. The former military leaders include retired generals and flag officers from every branch of the service. \u201cAmerica and our allies, in the Middle East and around the world, will be safer when this agreement is fully implemented,\u201d they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is absurd to believe that all these officials and experts were duped. They supported the deal because it was the most promising path to preventing an Iranian bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts were right. The deal is working. In the 10 months since the accord was signed, Iran has ripped out more than two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out all but a token amount of its formerly huge stockpile of uranium gas, and yanked out the core of its plutonium reactor, drilled it full of holes and filled it with concrete. The deal shrinks Iran\u2019s program to a fraction of its former size and wraps it in an airtight inspection regime tougher than any ever negotiated. The deal blocks Iran\u2019s every possible path to a bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuels and his allies tried to kill the deal. They failed. The Iran agreement is in place and working. The world is a safer place for it. Deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 22:15:03 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Joe Cirincione</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-new-york-times-magazine-david-samuels-ben-rhodes-iran-nuclear-deal-213880</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Why Trump Won\u2019t Get Sanders\u2019 Supporters</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-donald-trump-bernie-sanders-supporters-bernie-bros-213881</link>\n      <description>He\u2019s making a populist play for \u2018Bernie Bros\u2019 in the Midwest, but the ideological differences are too great.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For a presumptive nominee who\u2019s well behind Hillary Clinton in most polls, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem terribly worried about unifying the GOP behind him in the general election. Perhaps that\u2019s because Trump has another strategy in mind: stitching together a bipartisan coalition by winning over the nearly 10 million supporters of his comrade in populist anger, Bernie Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first naked appeals to the Bernie left last week, Trump &lt;a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/05/05/Trump-open-to-raising-federal-minimum-wage-in-GOP-agenda-break/3521462447644/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;suddenly announced on CNN&lt;/a&gt; he is \u201copen to doing something\u201d with the minimum wage and hinted on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that \u201cI wouldn't mind paying more\u201d in taxes. His campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, uncritically &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/29/politics/donald-trump-bernie-sanders/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;lumped Sanders together with Trump&lt;/a&gt;, saying they \u201chave reignited a group of people who have been disenfranchised and disappointed with the way Washington, D.C., and career politicians have run the country \u2026 and we will bring those people in.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the strategy makes sense. The only way for Trump to make up his national deficit to Clinton may be with a gang-buster performance in the white-dominated Midwestern Rust Belt, where the issue of jobs lost to trade\u2014a touchstone for both Trump and Sanders\u2014looms larger than elsewhere, and the appeal of another supposedly anti-Big Money candidate would be strong. Of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;eight national trial heats&lt;/a&gt; conducted in April, six post a Clinton lead of from 7 to 13 percentage points. If you assume Trump can\u2019t compete in the swing states with pivotal nonwhite voting blocs\u2014Florida, Virginia, Colorado and Nevada\u2014then perhaps he can add Ohio and Pennsylvania to the 2012 Mitt Romney states. He would still need two or three more in the north, such as Michigan, Iowa and New Hampshire. If Trump can\u2019t snag Pennsylvania, he would need to add bluer Minnesota and Wisconsin\u2014a near-sweep of the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various number-crunchers have concluded Trump would need to reach stratospheric levels of white support to run the table in the Midwest. Remember, Mitt Romney won 61 percent whites without a college degree, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/06/22/adios_ann_coulters_bad_electoral_math_127050.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;best any Republican did with white working-class voters this century&lt;/a&gt;. Yet for Romney to have won the national popular vote, he would have needed to boost that to 66 percent. And since Trump performs worse than Romney with women\u2014&lt;a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-hillary-clinton-doesnt-do-very-/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;recent polls show Trump 10 points off&lt;/a&gt; Romney\u2019s  poor pace\u2014Trump may need to win &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/white-women-measure-of-trumps-success/481305/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;more than 75 percent of white men.&lt;/a&gt;  Where will he find them? The \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d have been Republicans for a long time; perhaps the only way for Trump to hit his targets is by poaching the white male Sanders supporters known as the \u201cBernie Bros.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, Trump has a case to make that he\u2019s a more natural home for frustrated \u201cfelt-the-Bern\u201d voters than Clinton is. He is a more vociferous critic of global trade rules than she is. He does less big dollar campaign fundraising than she does. And he is a greater skeptic of military intervention than she is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bernie\u2019s revolutionaries are not now buying many tickets for the Trump Train, even as they confront the reality that Sanders can\u2019t win the nomination. While Clinton may have struggled to win millennials\u2014particularly &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/upshot/bernie-sanderss-legacy-the-left-may-no-longer-need-the-rich.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;white working class millennials\u2014&lt;/a&gt;in the primary against Sanders, they appear ready to forgive. Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, which specializes in surveying young voters, found &lt;a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/25/young-voters-overwhelmingly-prefer-clinton-over-trump-poll/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Clinton trounces Trump 61 percent to 25 percent with voters under 30 years of age&lt;/a&gt;, a bigger margin than Obama had over Romney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem for Trump is that the few areas of ideological overlap don\u2019t come close to outweighing the long list of issues where Sanders and Trump are practically opposites. Sanders supports a carbon tax; Trump calls global warming a &lt;a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/24/bernie-s/yes-donald-trump-really-did-tweet-climate-change-h/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;hoax&lt;/a&gt;. Sanders wants a $15 minimum wage; Trump has said &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/politics/donald-trump-explains-wages-too-high-comment/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201cour wages are too high.\u201d&lt;/a&gt; Sanders wants to jack the top income tax rate up to &lt;a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-senator-bernie-sanderss-tax-proposals/full\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;54 percent&lt;/a&gt;; Trump wants to slash it  to &lt;a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan/full\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;25 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their foreign policies do not dovetail that neatly. Sanders\u2019 anti-imperialist fans would not echo Trump\u2019s call to \u201ctake the oil\u201d in Iraq. Nor would they want to &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/17/donald-trump-on-waterboarding-torture-works/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201cauthorize something beyond waterboarding\u201d&lt;/a&gt; for suspected terrorists, let alone &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/trump-kill-isil-families-216343\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201ctake out their families.\u201d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there is the enormous gulf on race. Sanders has linked Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslims entering the country to Adolf Hitler\u2019s Holocaust, as a reminder &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/02/sanders-references-the-holocaust-when-discussing-trumps-intolerance-toward-muslims/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201cwhat a lunatic can do by stirring up racial hatred.\u201d&lt;/a&gt; While Sanders rails against excessive police violence and mass incarceration; Trump has said the police are &lt;a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/07/2962818/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201cabsolutely mistreated\u201d&lt;/a&gt; and endorsed a beating of a Black Lives Matter protester at one of his rallies, saying &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/22/black-activist-punched-at-donald-trump-rally-in-birmingham/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201cmaybe he should have been roughed up.\u201d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when Donald Trump tried to hold a rally in Chicago, it was Bernie Sanders supporters, outraged by Trump\u2019s racially divisive rhetoric, who &lt;a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-bernie-sanders-supporters-shut-down-donald-trump-rally-chicago\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;took over the arena and chased Trump out of town&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s a lot of disagreement for a shared view of the Trans-Pacific Partnership to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Sanders-Trump divide runs deeper than an issue checklist. The two camps live in  different politico-sociological worlds. As the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/opinion/campaign-stops/the-trump-sanders-fantasy.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;New York Times\u2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/opinion/campaign-stops/the-trump-sanders-fantasy.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; Thomas Edsall&lt;/a&gt; explained, citing the research of political scientist Emily Ekins and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, Trump and Sanders supporters register on opposite sides of the spectrum regarding their core values in the areas of authoritarianism, empathy and \u201cproportionality\u201d (the desire for people to \u201creap what they sow\u201d). In contrast, the value sets of Clinton and Sanders supporters are fairly close to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turn, Trump would need to go beyond tweaks in his platform and emulate Sanders\u2019 more compassionate worldview, even though doing so could risk a further fracturing of the Republican base. But the kind of \u201cpivots\u201d Trump displayed recently on economic issues falls well short of the mark. Trump\u2019s thin talk of a minimum wage increase was quickly followed, on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press,\u201d by a punt: \u201cI'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide,\u201d which makes his stance no different that any other Republican opposed to a federal increase. His feint on tax hikes came with the insistence that \u201cwe're giving a massive business tax cut.\u201d For good measure, during a CNN interview last week, he threw in a dig that Sanders \u201ccould be beyond a socialist\u201d before predictably bragging he can win his supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also can\u2019t flip-flop in a vacuum. The Clinton campaign\u2014perhaps with Sanders\u2019 help\u2014presumably is prepared to undercut Trump\u2019s populist aura by savaging him as a billionaire phony who &lt;a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/08/news/economy/donald-trump-trade/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;outsources the manufacturing of his products&lt;/a&gt; overseas, pays his casino workers below the Las Vegas Strip average and is &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/02/trump-workers-international-hotel-las-vegas-union-video\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;refusing to negotiate a new contract&lt;/a&gt; with his newly unionized employees. And Trump\u2019s other flip-flop this week\u2014hiring a &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-names-national-finance-chair-222846\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;former Goldman Sachs partner&lt;/a&gt; to spearhead a big-dollar fundraising push\u2014robs him of another opportunity to impress Sanders\u2019 supporters who detested Clinton\u2019s pursuit of Wall Street campaign cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover Clinton, as she did with Sanders, is unlikely to cede issues like trade to Trump. Die-hard Sanders supporters didn\u2019t believe her when she abandoned her past support of TPP, but she blurred the distinction with Sanders well enough to win where it counted: the Rust Belt states of &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/oh/Dem\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/pa/Dem\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. In both contests, she split the white working class vote and won with voters who said global trade takes away American jobs. In fact, those are two of the  eight states that Clinton won in both 2008 and 2016 primaries. Primary performance doesn\u2019t predict general election performance\u2014Obama\u2019s Rust Belt primary losses meant nothing come November\u2014but Clinton at least is experienced at downplaying her husband\u2019s record in support of global trade agreements among the voters most bitter about it in the most critical swing states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Sanders supporters, trade is not a stand-alone voting issue\u2014most of his base is too young to have lost a factory job because of NAFTA or Permanent Normal Trade Relation Status with China. Trade is part of a broader critique about how the rules are rigged for the billionaire class, of which Trump is a member. Trump\u2019s promise to negotiate better deals doesn\u2019t automatically signal to millennial democratic socialists that what he thinks is a better deal matches what they think is a better deal, if at the same time he\u2019s on record supporting low wages and low top end tax rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True, Clinton heads into the general election with tenuous party unity. One quarter of Sanders voters said in a &lt;a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article70202867.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;McClatchy-Marist poll&lt;/a&gt; last month they would not vote for her in November. While that number is likely overheated by the intensity of the primary, it would not be surprising to see Clinton lose some of her left flank, if not to Trump, then to the Libertarian Party\u2019s Gary Johnson or the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein, both of whom are actively courting Sanders\u2019 voters. Anyone who believes that Clinton is a war-mongering tool of Wall Street will at least be open to the argument that Trump is a lesser  evil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Trump needs far more than a faction of protest votes. The 2016 race starts with more blue states than red states. The general election polls prove that, as of today, there are more #NeverTrump Republicans than #BernieOrBust Democrats. Trump must outright capture Bernie\u2019s revolution to compensate for the damage he\u2019s inflicted on Republican Party unity and swipe the Rust Belt from the Democrats. To pull that off, he\u2019s going to have to sound a lot more revolutionary than he actually is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 09:17:36 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>(Bill Scher)</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-donald-trump-bernie-sanders-supporters-bernie-bros-213881</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Why China\u2019s Not Afraid of Donald J.

Most Weibo comments consist of guffawing emojis and crude jokes. The&lt;i&gt; Global Times&lt;/i&gt;, the state-run conservative tabloid, &lt;a href=\"http://mil.huanqiu.com/observation/2016-05/8847358.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that Sino-American trade has in fact benefited the United States, all while still dismissing Trump\u2019s statement as a mere ploy to rally his populist base. On the state-managed Chinese news website Interface, one article even &lt;a href=\"http://www.jiemian.com/article/634125.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; the \u201crape\u201d comment as cause for a Trump presidency: Better for the U.S. president to care about business deals than aggressively promoting America\u2019s democratic values abroad or bolstering U.S. allies in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019ve been paying any attention to Trump\u2019s rhetoric on the campaign trail, you might imagine China would be quaking in its boots. Rarely has a candidate so relentlessly attacked a peaceful trade partner. Trump has accused China of manipulating its currency and stealing American jobs, and promised a 45 percent tariff on all Chinese goods\u2014intended to devastate the country\u2019s export-driven economy. He has even &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/gallery/2016/04/donald-trump-twitter-account-history-social-media-campaign-000631?slide=3\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; far more about China than about any other of his favorite foreign nemeses like Mexico or ISIS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These attacks have &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/us/politics/donald-trump-trade-policy-china.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;worried&lt;/a&gt; economists, diplomats and free-trade advocates. But one group that seems surprisingly sanguine is the Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as China\u2019s government has &lt;a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-04/china-media-pulls-punches-for-now-on-trump-s-escalating-rhetoric\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;refused to comment&lt;/a&gt; on Trump\u2019s diatribes, a survey of both official state media and social media networks reveals that a growing contingent of Chinese believe the mogul\u2019s potential presidency could actually end up benefiting China\u2014perhaps more so than a President Hillary Clinton, whose criticism of the country\u2019s human rights record infuriates Chinese leaders. Some Chinese admire Trump\u2019s glitzy businesses, big-name brand and candid personality. Others genuinely think the candidate\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy positions would give China the upper hand in Sino-American relations and allow more room for China to assert itself on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn\u2019t start out this way. In the early days of the campaign, government-run news outlets tended to paint Trump as \u201ca buffoon or a joke,\u201d as Xincheng Shen, a U.S.-based writer for state-managed news site The Paper, told me. But as Trump has racked up more primary wins and asserted his foreign policy positions, China\u2019s state outlets have grown more receptive. Among layman pundits on Chinese social media, the support has been even stronger. On  Weibo, the candidate has inspired popular groups such as \u201cTrump Fan Club\u201d and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\u201cGreat Man Donald Trump.\u201d In a late March &lt;a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/976613.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; of 3,330 &lt;i&gt;Global Times &lt;/i&gt;readers, 54 percent of respondents said they supported a Trump presidency\u2014well above the roughly &lt;a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Americans who currently do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTrump is very, very popular among Chinese Internet users,\u201d says Kecheng Fang, a former reporter in China who now researches Chinese media at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the Trump support in China boils down to his reputation overseas as a shrewd entrepreneur\u2014an image that surely resonates with China\u2019s plutocrats and aspirers.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(\u201cChina today has this obsession with successful businessmen,\u201d Shen notes.)&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Over the past decade&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; the Trump brand has been making inroads in the Chinese market, with the mogul promoting his Southeast Asia and U.S. luxury hotels specifically&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to Chinese travelers, in addition to looking for &lt;a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2015-10/17/content_22205695.htm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;new locations&lt;/a&gt; in Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai. Trump himself has boasted about doing business with Chinese companies and leasing real estate to Chinese patrons. \u201cI do great with China. I sell them condos. I have the largest bank in the world from China, the largest in the world by far,\u201d he claimed last week. \u201cThey\u2019re a tenant of  mine in a building I own in Manhattan.\u201d  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s reality TV show, &lt;i&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/i&gt;, also has a &lt;a href=\"http://v.pptv.com/page/6EVAviaaMicDqdG4M.html?rcc_id=baiduchuisou\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;following&lt;/a&gt; in China, as does his daughter, Ivanka Trump, whose high-life-oriented Weibo account has 15,000 fans. The image of success and opulence that Trump cultivates has even led some Chinese businesses to &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-35839782\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;coopt&lt;/a&gt; his surname\u2014from the luxury toilet seat manufacturer Shenzhen Trump Industries to the Henan real estate firm Trump Consulting to the Anhui air purifier producer Trump Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond just Trump\u2019s brand, many Chinese believe his business acumen would translate into political pragmatism on matters of national security and foreign policy\u2014which would play to China\u2019s advantage. Trump has repeatedly questioned the wisdom of maintaining American military bases and warships in the region, arguing that they cost the United States money while allowing allies like Japan to mooch off American support in their squabbles with China in the East and South China seas. \u201cIf we\u2019re attacked, they do not have to come to our defense,\u201d Trump told the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; in late March. \u201cIf they\u2019re attacked, we have to come totally to their defense. And that is a\u2014that\u2019s a real problem.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese state media have responded favorably to this rhetoric; China clearly sees U.S. armed forces in the area as a nuisance, if not a threat, and with American and Chinese warships patrolling the same crowded waterways, the two countries have been playing a risky game of chicken. A &lt;i&gt;Global Times&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/976299.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; published a day after Trump\u2019s &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; interview reads, \u201cIt is hence predictable that if Trump is elected president, he will choose to cooperate with China, from which Japan will fail to benefit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves room for China to assert itself. An &lt;a href=\"http://military.people.com.cn/BIG5/n1/2016/0323/c1011-28220011.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the &lt;i&gt;People\u2019s Daily&lt;/i&gt;, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, noted that Trump\u2019s snubs toward America\u2019s Asian allies, namely Japan and South Korea, will allow China to become the dominant military power in the Pacific. Because the South China Sea isn\u2019t oil rich, a Trump-led military would likely turn its attention away from Asia and toward the Middle East, says Shen, who last month published a widely circulated &lt;a href=\"http://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1437306\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in The Paper headlined \u201cDo Not Rush to Say Trump Is Crazy.\u201d \u201cIt seems like [Trump] only wants to get involved in something militarily when there is a business benefit,\u201d Shen argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On economic issues, Trump has been much more aggressively anti-China; his tax and anti-currency manipulation proposals have even raised the prospect of a trade war. But many Chinese observers see these \u201ctough\u201d positions as bluster\u2014part of Trump\u2019s appeal to Republican voters at home\u2014and believe he would soften his stance once in office. For one thing, his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2014a multinational trade deal meant to counterbalance China\u2019s economic dominance in the region\u2014has led some in Chinese state &lt;a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/976613.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to believe Trump would be more open to commercial relations with China than he lets off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;i&gt;People\u2019s Daily&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrbhwb/html/2016-03/22/content_1662774.htm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; argued further that the likelihood of Trump actually causing a crisis with China has been exaggerated by the American media. (The inevitable imprecision of translation could also be a factor, Shen points out; certain Mandarin words, such as the word for \u201cliar,\u201d lack the political impact of their English equivalents.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for Trump\u2019s appeal in China has to do with China\u2019s &lt;a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/2016/03/could-a-donald-trump-presidency-improve-us-china-ties-chinese-netizens-say-yes/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;intense skepticism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;toward the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency. The \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d\u2014a push during Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state to increase America\u2019s military presence and advance human rights in the region\u2014has long been a source of anxiety for the Chinese, who see it as an attempt by the United States to control and suppress China\u2019s rise. That policy, which Chinese associate closely with Clinton, has caused \u201cdissatisfaction among Chinese netizens,\u201d Wu Xinbo, a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, recently told the &lt;i&gt;Global Times&lt;/i&gt;, \u201cwhile Trump\u2019s outspokenness and straightforwardness have gained him more support.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton has also criticized China for human rights violations and online censorship since her days as first lady and later at Foggy Bottom, leading some Chinese netizens and state media outlets to believe she would be more ideological and less flexible than Trump in diplomatic dealings with China. \u201cUnlike traditional idealistic politicians, who tend to place ideological values, such as democracy and human rights, as the priority in their diplomacy, Trump has more realistic interests in mind,\u201d a recent &lt;a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/974218.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Global Times&lt;/i&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Trump\u2019s apparently pliable views on human rights (he has expressed interest in bringing back torture, for one) and disregard for traditional bounds of discussion in American politics have helped him win fans from the more nationalistic corners of Chinese social media. In China, a strain of Islamophobia has emerged in response to both terror attacks abroad and outrage at Chinese affirmative-action policies that favor Muslim students in the scoring of the &lt;i&gt;gaokao&lt;/i&gt;, the standardized college entrance exam. \u201cMany Chinese share Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim and anti-political-correctness sentiment,\u201d says Fang, who has followed Trump-related discussions on Zhihu, China\u2019s Quora equivalent. One particularly popular Zhihu &lt;a href=\"https://www.zhihu.com/question/41401558/answer/91442852\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in support of Trump\u2019s policy to ban Muslims from entering the United States reads, \u201cA Western civilization dominated by political correctness is [\u2026] doomed to die.\u201d The post received almost 10,000 upvotes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be a mistake, of course, to overstate Trump\u2019s popularity in China. The Chinese media landscape is massive and does have its fair share of anti-Trump doomsayers who portray him as a racist clown. In a recent interview with the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;, China\u2019s finance minister, Lou Jiwei, became a rare Chinese officials to comment on Trump, &lt;a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-finance-ministerlou-jiwei-takes-aim-at-donald-trumps-trade-policies-1460892988#:uc22dd4tK3_0jA\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;calling him&lt;/a&gt; an \u201cirrational type.\u201d And the candidate\u2019s recent suggestion that Japan and South Korea build up their own nuclear arsenals to supplant U.S. support in the region has caused some sincere alarm, with the &lt;a href=\"http://world.huanqiu.com/exclusive/2016-03/8783600.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; calling the remark \u201creckless.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But often the anti-Trumpism comes with a dash of anti-Americanism: Numerous Chinese journalists have pointed to Trump\u2019s rise as evidence of the inherent faults in the American political system, chalking up his success to the failure of the democratic system to give the middle-class a voice in politics. &lt;a href=\"http://gx.people.com.cn/n2/2016/0303/c229256-27854328.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The &lt;i&gt;People\u2019s Daily&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;has pointed to the disillusionment of young American voters as fuel for Trump\u2019s rise, while the &lt;a href=\"http://world.huanqiu.com/hot/2016-03/8637633.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://world.huanqiu.com/hot/2016-03/8637633.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;has cast Trump in a cautionary tale about the perils of populism. \u201cTrump and [Bernie] Sanders\u2019 rise clearly shows that Americans have lost confidence in their political system,\u201d the author wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is only a good thing for China. \u201cOur nation\u2019s strength is growing, while America\u2019s is declining,\u201d a recent article in the tabloid &lt;a href=\"http://opinion.huanqiu.com/opinion_world/2016-04/8811032.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reads&lt;/a&gt;.

Chris Collins (R-N.Y), Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) \u2013 made a pitch to Ryan about why he should back Trump, according to multiple sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the members had reached out to Ryan privately before the meeting to express their disappointment with his bombshell interview last week in which he said he wasn\u2019t sure Trump was the conservative standard-bearer the party needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, has reached out to the House Freedom Caucus to schedule a meeting with the chamber\u2019s most ardent conservatives \u2014 many of whom are also his biggest critics on the Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Scott DesJarlais \u2014 one of the few Freedom Caucus members who has endorsed Trump and an attendee of the Ryan meeting on Wednesday \u2014 pitched the idea to the caucus board Tuesday night on behalf of the Trump campaign. The Tennessee Republican is working behind the scenes to coordinate Trump\u2019s outreach to lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board members, led by Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), agreed to set up the meeting, though nothing is has been formally scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action comes ahead of Thursday\u2019s sit-down at the Republican National Committee with Trump, Ryan and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priebus, who talks regularly with the brash billionaire, has taken on the role of peacemaker after he declared Trump the \u201cpresumptive nominee\u201d following his blowout win in Indiana next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many establishment Republicans have not been willing to fall in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush last week said they would not honor the loyalty pledge that they signed as presidential candidates to support the eventual nominee. Graham especially has been outspoken about his horror at Trump\u2019s ascension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTo the Hispanic community, I get it why you don't like us,\u201d Graham said on Wednesday about Trump\u2019s incendiary comments and proposals regarding Mexican immigrants. \u201cI mean, who's going to vote for somebody that's gonna deport their grandmother?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf you had told me in 2013 that by 2016 we'd be running on forced deportation and that Megyn Kelly was a bimbo,\u201d Graham said during the Peter G. Peterson Foundation\u2019s Fiscal Summit. \u201cWe got problems. I hope he adjusts.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan upped the ante with his own disavowal \u2013 for now \u2013 of Trump last week. Talking to reporters on Wednesday, the speaker declined to get in a back-and-forth about the forthcoming sit-down, saying he didn\u2019t want to negotiate with Trump through the press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan is expected to try to hash out whether they can plot a path forward. The two men diverge sharply in their styles and approaches, and they have sharp differences on policy areas like trade and immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan would not say what he needs to hear form Trump in order to endorse him, or what sort of positions he\u2019d need to switch, if any. He said he just wants to get to know the New York billionaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don't really know him,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI met him once in person in 2012\u2026. We just need to get to know each other and we as a leadership team are enjoying the fact that we have a chance to meet with him.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also warned that his fellow skeptics are not going to warm to Trump overnight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTo pretend we\u2019re unified as a party after coming through this pretty bruising primary, which just ended like a week ago, to pretend we unified without actually unifying \u2014 then we go in the fall at half-strength,\u201d he said. \u201cThis election is too important to go into the election at strength. That means we need a real unification of our party\u2026. That\u2019s going to take some effort.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats have hardly restrained their glee as they watch their Republican counterparts squirm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi held a press conference on Wednesday with other Democratic leaders to try to closely tether Trump\u2019s rhetoric and proposals to GOP lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cSome Republicans, including members of their leadership, have said they cannot support the vile rhetoric and radical proposals of the Republican front-runner,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cToday, we have gathered to ask, since when? Since when have the House Republicans been so concerned about intolerant statements and discriminatory ideas?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pelosi said Republicans appear to be surprised by the rhetoric Trump and former GOP candidates deployed on the campaign trail. \u201cBut year after year, Republicans have enthusiastically turned their intolerance and their discrimination into legislation,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pelosi found some kinder words for Trump later in the day, as she spoke at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation Fiscal Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recounted the one time she met Trump years ago at his office in New York City. Pelosi said that at the time, she found him &amp;quot;lovely&amp;quot; and that he was a &amp;quot;gentleman.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nick Gass, Nolan D. McCaskill and Brianna Gurciullo contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 19:36:57 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>rbade@politico.com (Rachael Bade)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-paul-ryan-negotiations-223083</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Senate kills Cotton\u2019s Iran amendment \u2013 and rescues spending bill</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/democrats-iran-amendment-spending-bill-223052</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Senate Democrats killed the GOP's latest attack on President Barack Obama's&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Iran policies on Wednesday, righting the wobbly annual spending process that is the cornerstone of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An amendment from Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) that would prohibit the United States from buying heavy water left over from Iran\u2019s nuclear program threatened to halt the first appropriations bill of the season, an energy and water funding proposal, and, by extension, the entire process. But under a deal brokered by Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the Senate voted on the Cotton amendment at an unattainable 60-vote threshold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cotton amendment fell short on a 57-42 vote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the water spending measure was allowed to proceed, the dispute opened a fissure among Republicans who have been in lockstep on Iran policy since unanimously voting against the nuclear deal last year. Alexander said the amendment would have opened up the leftovers of Iran\u2019s nuclear program to the open market \u2014 rather than bringing them to the U.S., where they can be put to peaceful purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m opposed to the Iran agreement,\u201d Alexander said this week. \u201cI\u2019m also opposed to North Korea or other countries [being able to] buy heavy water that could be used to make plutonium or nuclear weapons. It raises a whole complex set of national security issues.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cotton responded in an interview Tuesday that without his amendment, \u201cwe\u2019re just creating for Iran the incentive to manufacture more heavy water.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe and I disagree on the merits,\u201d Cotton said of Alexander. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate dispute presages a difficult race to finish all 12 annual appropriations bills by October. Republicans say that Democrats are looking for an excuse to derail the process and undermine the GOP\u2019s good government bona fides in an election year, while Democrats say McConnell is struggling to keep his troops in line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats and some Republicans said they were blindsided by Cotton\u2019s amendment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey need to quit obstructing with poison pill amendments,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a member of Democratic leadership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cotton\u2019s measure would have blocked, starting Oct. 1, any new Energy Department purchases of Iran\u2019s heavy water, which could otherwise be used to produce material suitable for a nuclear bomb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cotton responded that \u201cpoison pill\u201d is \u201cCapitol Hill code\u201d for an amendment that Democrats oppose but has the votes to pass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many Democrats, letting Cotton\u2019s amendment pass would have opened the door for more challenges to the Iranian agreement that lifted United Nations sanctions on the country in exchange for dismantling equipment that could be used to build nuclear weapons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his amendment was not seen as a serious threat to the Iran deal, some in the GOP sympathized with Cotton\u2019s efforts and said they felt they\u2019d run out of options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWith an administration that won\u2019t talk to you or consider anything you say, a vote\u2019s the best way [to send a message]. \u2026 It\u2019s the only way,\u201d Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cotton said he was motivated to act after an announcement last month that the Energy Department would make a one-time purchase of 32 tons of Iranian heavy water, a substance that can be used in nuclear reactor research as well as in the development of nuclear weapons. As part of last year\u2019s deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program, Tehran agreed to cap its inventory of heavy water by either selling it, diluting it or destroying it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas Republican\u2019s amendment wouldn\u2019t stop the purchase already in progress, but would prevent the Obama administration from buying the material in the future \u2014 which Cotton says would limit the amount of taxpayer dollars he fears Iran will funnel to terrorist organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Cotton used a similar tactic with an amendment on a bill that allowed for congressional review of the Iran nuclear deal, upending a bipartisan deal on amendment votes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic resistance to Cotton\u2019s amendment had already blocked approval of the energy and water appropriations bill three times, including in a vote on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has repeatedly suggested that the freshman senator\u2019s insistence on a vote for the measure showed a lack of patience, and that his request ran afoul of the chamber\u2019s customs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI can remember year after year after year when I had an amendment on a bill and I never got a vote for it,\u201d Feinstein, the top Democrat on energy and water spending programs, said this week. \u201cSo, that\u2019s not an unusual thing to happen. What has been an unusual thing is for one person to take down a bill.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) supported Cotton\u2019s amendment and said that he and other lawmakers were developing \u201cbroader legislation to deal with Iran\u201d that will be out \u201cvery soon.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge national lab is taking the heavy water under last year\u2019s deal with Iran and will sell some of it to universities and hospitals for medical research. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 15:22:45 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Burgess Everett</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/democrats-iran-amendment-spending-bill-223052</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump campaign reaches out to Freedom Caucus</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-freedom-caucus-223065</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign has reached out to the House Freedom Caucus to schedule a meeting with the chamber\u2019s most ardent conservatives \u2014 many of whom are also his biggest critics on the Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep.

And while campaign surrogates on the Hill told POLITICO he plans to meet with bigger groups of lawmakers eventually, he doesn\u2019t plan to do so this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His meeting with the Freedom Caucus is sure to be a tense one. Conservatives say his tone and comments suggest he doesn\u2019t respect the constitution. They\u2019re wary of his views of executive branch authority, and many have problems with Trump\u2019s views on minimum wage and abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;One caucus member, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, has said he will never vote for Trump. Many others agree but have not been as vocal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOP sources familiar with some of the caucus members' thinking say the group is very unlikely to ever endorse Trump en masse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 15:54:13 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>jsherman@politico.com (Jake Sherman)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-freedom-caucus-223065</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>The Forest Service's climate change failure</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/05/the-forest-services-climate-change-failure-000119</link>\n      <description>The agency faces historic costs due to climate change. So why is it opening up land for coal mining?</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From the Paris climate agreement to recent proposals to limit pollution from oil and gas wells, President Barack Obama has made combating climate change a focal point of his final year in office. But at least one agency within his administration is actively pushing policies that undercut these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Forest Service is tasked with protecting 190 million acres of land throughout the country, including high alpine meadows, towering spruce and stately ponderosa pines. It has a clear legal mandate to protect forest resources, as well as to \u201cprotect and, where appropriate, improve the quality of soil, water, and air resources.\u201d So it might come as surprise to learn that instead of working to limit greenhouse gas pollution, it\u2019s pursuing policies that actually exacerbate climate change \u2014 notably the impending approval of a huge coal mining expansion in remote Colorado wildlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s no question climate change threatens forests, watersheds and wildlife: It dries woodlands, weakens trees so they are more susceptible to insects and disease, and lengthens the fire season. The fire season in the United States and elsewhere is starting earlier and lasting longer, and fires are burning with more intensity. Those fires can damage ecosystems and drain agency budgets; last year, the Forest Service spent more than half of its budget on firefighting, &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/sites/default/files/2015-Fire-Budget-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;compared with just 16 percent in 1995&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause is no secret: As The New York Times put it &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/science/wildfires-season-global-warming.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;in a recent report&lt;/a&gt;: \u201cA leading culprit is climate change. Drier winters mean less moisture on the land, and warmer springs are pulling the moisture into the air more quickly, turning shrub, brush and grass into kindling.\u201d This conclusion has been &lt;a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5789/940\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;documented in scientific literature for at least a decade&lt;/a&gt;. The Forest Service\u2019s boss, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, knows the source of this problem as well. \u201cWe take our job to protect the public [from fire] seriously, and recently, the job has become increasingly difficult due to the effects of climate change, chronic droughts and a constrained budget environment in Washington,\u201d he &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/science/wildfires-season-global-warming.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told the Times&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change is also making insect outbreaks last longer. In Colorado, millions of acres of spruce and pine trees have been killed by beetles. Such outbreaks are typically halted only by a week or two of bitter cold temperatures. But with climate change bringing warmer winters to the West, those cold snaps rarely happen and the beetles munch on. This has further damaged trees in Colorado and stretched the Forest Service\u2019s resources. And once these trees die, the forest may not recover. A Forest Service &lt;a href=\"http://a123.g.akamai.net/7/123/11558/abc123/forestservic.download.akamai.com/11558/www/nepa/96623_FSPLT3_2720775.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;study completed in February&lt;/a&gt; predicted that iconic aspen and spruce forests would virtually disappear across large swaths of southwest Colorado forests in less than 45 years as landscapes dry out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of wildlife, water and recreation that these forests protect will have economic and fiscal impacts on local communities and states. Touring forests in the fall when bright green aspen leaves turn gold and orange &lt;a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114195038\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;is big business&lt;/a&gt;. The loss of these forests will also consume much more of the Forest Service\u2019s budget. The agency is committed to spending &lt;a href=\"http://a123.g.akamai.net/7/123/11558/abc123/forestservic.download.akamai.com/11558/www/nepa/96623_FSPLT3_2720775.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;tens of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; over the next decade logging the forests to try to stem the impacts to spruce and aspen decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the significant threat climate change poses to the agency\u2019s budget and the nation\u2019s trees, the Forest Service should be doing all it can to reduce its own contribution to climate change. But instead, as soon as this month, the agency intends to rubber-stamp a plan &lt;a href=\"http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2015/forest-service-revs-up-push-to-open-over-170-million-tons-of-coal-to-mining-from-colorado-roadless-forest\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;to open 20,000 acres of roadless Colorado forest to road-building&lt;/a&gt;, a move designed to pave the way for mining 170 million tons of coal there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Service\u2019s decision will light the fuse to a huge carbon bomb; when burned, this coal will cause 130 million additional tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions \u2014 as much as running a large coal-fired power plant nonstop for over a decade. This despite &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd485194.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the agency\u2019s own data&lt;/a&gt; that show burning that coal will cause billions of dollars in damage to the world\u2019s economy and environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Service defends this move by saying that 300 mining jobs and local royalties and tax revenue may be lost if the coal stays in the ground. But the proposal will benefit only a single mine (owned by the bankrupt Arch Coal Inc.) that has tens of millions of tons of coal already under lease \u2014 enough to keep the mine open for another decade. In other words, those mining jobs aren\u2019t actually risk in the short term, and in the long term, there\u2019s time to help these individuals and communities transition to jobs in a clean energy economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the Service is not primarily tasked with regulating greenhouse gas emissions or enforcing an energy policy, the agency does have a duty to protect forests and so a profound interest in reducing greenhouse gas pollution. Opening Colorado\u2019s roadless forest to coal mining is just one of several recent decisions that the Forest Service has made that undercuts the agency\u2019s interests, making its job of managing the nation\u2019s forest more difficult and more costly. Last month, the agency opened the door to &lt;a href=\"http://www.athensnews.com/news/local/blm-draft-assessment-leasing-to-drillers-won-t-hurt-national/article_af68f364-0fc0-11e6-9b7d-734bf3299019.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;oil and gas fracking on 18,000 acres of national forest in Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. The agency has also rejected proposals to stop coal mining on Forest Service-managed grasslands in Wyoming and refuses to take any action to require the capture of methane \u2014 a greenhouse gas on steroids \u2014 emitted from coal mines on its lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these actions run counter to Obama\u2019s bold rhetoric and leadership initiatives on climate. In vetoing the Keystone XL pipeline last November, Obama &lt;a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/06/statement-president-keystone-xl-pipeline\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;explicitly acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground\u201d to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Unfortunately, the Forest Service hasn\u2019t gotten the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s time the Forest Service crafted a sustainable plan to combat climate change by reining in its own contribution to the problem. It can start by rejecting the proposal to open Colorado\u2019s roadless forest to coal mining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ted Zukoski is a staff attorney in the Denver office of Earthjustice, where he litigates cases pro bono on climate and wildlands protection on behalf of conservation groups.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 09:20:14 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Ted Zukoski</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/05/the-forest-services-climate-change-failure-000119</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>What Trump really said about the debt</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/05/what-trump-really-said-about-the-debt-000117</link>\n      <description>His argument might be hard to untangle, but it's more sensible than some of the things that normal politicians believe.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump last week set off an uproar in financial circles after the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/us/politics/donald-trumps-idea-to-cut-national-debt-get-creditors-to-accept-less.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that he would consider renegotiating terms on U.S. Treasury bonds. Though it might sound obscure to non-financial types, the idea could easily destabilize global markets: U.S. debt, the safest asset in the world, is the foundation of the entire financial system. The economic consequences of such a move would ripple across the world, and quite possibly trigger a severe recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Trump were really proposing persuading creditors to accept less than face value of U.S. bonds, it would be an irresponsible\u2014even disqualifying\u2014statement from the presumptive Republican nominee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But did Trump really suggest that? It\u2019s not clear he did.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to watch the interview where Trump first proposed renegotiating U.S. debt, but I couldn\u2019t find it online. However, a transcript of his remarks appears on Nexis and, to my surprise, Trump explicitly ruled out renegotiating the debt. But he also glibly spoke of \u201c[making] a deal\u201d and appeared confused about key economic concepts related to debt. As often happens with Trump, it\u2019s tough to figure out his actual position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quote that triggered the original story\u2014and much of the handwringing\u2014came after Trump appeared on CNBC and spoke about his experience with debt in the business world. Then he said: \u201cBut I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. And if the economy was good, it was good.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did Trump mean when he said \u201cmake a deal\u201d? Did he mean that a damaged economy could give the U.S. government leverage to force creditors to accept worse terms? CNBC\u2019s Becky Quick followed up by asking if he meant renegotiating. \u201cNo,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI think there are times for us to refinance. \u2026 And I could see long-term renegotiations, where we borrow at very long-term rates.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a matter of seconds, Trump went from opposing renegotiations to saying he could see long-term renegotiations. Deciphering a policy position from these sentences is impossible. Given the confusion here, Quick followed up again, \u201cBut let\u2019s be clear, you\u2019re not talking about renegotiating sovereign bonds that the U.S. has already issued?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump responded, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to renegotiate the bonds.\u201d That\u2019s Trump\u2019s clearest statement in the entire CNBC interview: He explicitly ruled out renegotiating the terms of the debt. A second later, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m not taking about a renegotiation, but you can buy back at discounts.\u201d Neither of these sentences made it into the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; piece, nor into many other pieces on the story. That may be because video is not on CNBC\u2019s website, so it has made it difficult to check Trump\u2019s actual words. For whatever reason, those key sentences have been lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has a point, then, when he complains he was misrepresented. And in an &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-no-debt-default-222957\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; on CNN Monday morning, Trump elaborated on his proposal to refinance government debt. &amp;quot;I said if we can buy back government debt as a discount,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, if interest rates go up and we can buy bonds back as a discount, if we are liquid enough as a country we should do that.\u201d This idea is reasonable enough. The government has the ability to buy back its old debt and this could, in fact, reduce the nominal value of U.S. debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s how it would work: As interest rates rise, the value of existing U.S. Treasuries falls\u2014the higher rates on new debt make them comparatively more attractive than old debt with lower interest rates. This gives the U.S. government an opportunity to buy back those bonds below face value&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;thus lowering the debt it holds.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;However, in borrowing money to buy those bonds, the government must pay the higher market interest rate on the new debt. In the end, the total debt amount might fall, but the government\u2019s interest payments will be about unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf we\u2019re concerned about our interest payments, it hasn\u2019t done any good,\u201d said Dean Baker, the director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research who co-wrote a &lt;a href=\"http://cepr.net/documents/publications/financial-engineering-2013-07.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;short paper&lt;/a&gt; on the topic in 2013. The paper estimated that the government could reduce the debt by $458 billion by buying discounted Treasuries\u2014an amount that doesn't make much of a dent in a national debt of around $14 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump could take this a step further if he installed a chair at the Federal Reserve who printed new money to purchase old debt. In economics, this is called \u201cmonetizing the debt.\u201d Some Republicans have argued that the Fed did just this during Obama\u2019s presidency when it bought trillions of dollars of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. (The Fed's view is that with rates at zero, it needed unconventional tools to stimulate the economy.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Trump want to print money to pay down the debt? He doesn\u2019t say so in either interview. But he does say on CNN, \u201cThis is the United States government. First of all, you never have to default because you print the money. I hate to tell you. So there\u2019s never a default.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump deserves some credit for this point. Read generously, in fact, his comments demonstrate a more coherent position on U.S. debt than that of many top Republicans. The GOP has frequently argued that the U.S. could soon end up like Greece if it doesn\u2019t reduce its debt. The key difference between the U.S. and Greece, though, is that the U.S. can print dollars while Greece, as part of the E.U., cannot print Euros. In other words, the only way the U.S. can end up like Greece is if it &lt;i&gt;chooses&lt;/i&gt; not to pay its debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, printing money carries a significant risk \u2013 namely, higher inflation. If Trump proposed buying back all U.S. debt by printing money, it would likely set off an inflationary spiral that would inflict major damage on the country. But as far as I can tell\u2014and let\u2019s be clear, who knows?\u2014he\u2019s not proposing that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump refers to himself as the \u201cKing of Debt,\u201d a title intended to demonstrate his deep understanding and experience with it. And he does have experience: Trump has made use of debt, and U.S. bankruptcy laws, liberally throughout his career. Four of his business have declared bankruptcy; during the Republican primary, he bragged about his use of the bankruptcy code as a sign of business acumen. But it\u2019s still not clear how this skill would translate into practice as president, where your job is to run a government that &lt;i&gt;can\u2019t&lt;/i&gt; go bankrupt.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken on its face, Trump's convoluted answer provides little information about his actual position on U.S. debt and further reinforces his image as a candidate with little understanding of public policy. But his actual proposal to refinance Treasuries is not as extreme as it\u2019s being portrayed\u2014and he gets at least one big thing right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 13:58:38 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>dvinik@politico.com (Danny Vinik)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/05/what-trump-really-said-about-the-debt-000117</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>How to get justice in civil rights cold cases</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/05/how-to-get-justice-for-civil-rights-cold-cases-000118</link>\n      <description>The DOJ's Civil Rights Cold Case Division isn't working. It's time to open up the investigations.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Wharlest Jackson was just like any other husband and father, trying to earn a living to support his family. Transcending the limits facing black men in 1960s Mississippi, Jackson became a factory foreman. But Jackson wanted more, he wanted a more egalitarian future for his children and thus served as the treasurer for the local chapter of the NAACP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mississippi, even two years after the Voting Rights Act passed, this was dangerous. The Silver Dollar Group, which consisted of Klansmen who believed deeply in violence, sought to put an end to any form of black integration and social elevation. On Feb. 27, 1967, in Natchez, Mississippi, Wharlest Jackson was killed by a car bomb many now believe was orchestrated by the Silver Dollar Group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his murder, the FBI generated more than 10,000 pages of documents to identify the suspects, but the files were never released and the murderers never charged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, almost 50 years later, the FBI still hasn\u2019t solved the Jackson murder or more than 100 similar cases. If any justice is to be served and closure brought to the victims\u2019 families, the government must \u201ccrowdsource\u201d the investigation and allow the public to review the raw case materials. Investigative reporters, local prosecutors and historians are the last, best chance to resolve these crimes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But right now, that is nearly impossible thanks to archaic laws that restrict the release of case materials. Without reforming this system and providing the public access to these files, Jackson and many other victims will never receive the justice they deserve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important prerequisite to approaching any civil rights case is having the necessary background information, texts and transcripts to use as evidence. To obtain these pieces of text, one must fill out a Freedom of Information Act request, which is a formal request to the federal government for a certain document or group of documents. Though this process may seem straightforward, it is actually extremely inefficient and time-consuming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the median processing time for large FOIA requests to the FBI is 475 days. In those instances when the FBI sends the documents instead of refusing access altogether, many of the documents are heavily redacted, so that they are virtually useless for research purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it a significant struggle for outsiders to access evidence that could potentially resolve these cold cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Emmett Till Act, passed in 2007 to honor the memory of the young man whose callous murder in 1955 helped ignite the civil rights movement, created the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Cold Case Division, which focuses exclusively on solving these civil rights cold cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite their best efforts, the number of civil rights cold cases resolved by the DOJ and FBI since the Emmett Till Act was passed is still a heart-rending zero. In fact, almost all of the civil rights cold cases that have been resolved in the past 40 years owe that resolution to the efforts of reporters, investigative journalists and local prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the government\u2019s inaction to resolve these cold cases and the public\u2019s interest in providing justice to the victims of these cases are clear reasons to pass a bill that would facilitate the release of documents related to civil rights cold cases. The bill, which has already been written by an AP Government and Politics class from Hightstown, New Jersey, calls for the creation of an independent review board to assess whether classified documents can be released to the public and whether they truly need redacting. With this expeditious release of documents, attorneys, journalists and reporters who care deeply about the cases would have a substantial amount of evidence to resolve the cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some claim that releasing these civil rights cold case files would endanger the lives of former informants as well as other government officials. However, it is highly unlikely that anyone will be negatively affected from the release of these documents. Most of the cases in question took place over 50 years ago, and many of those involved are dead. The reluctance of the government to release these files is an example of the overclassification that has become a trend in many departments. Because government officials can face serious consequences for failing to classify sensitive materials, it is in their own interest to classify and withhold any material in question, regardless of whether there is any real danger in releasing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who doubt the viability of the board can be assured that it is not without precedent. The bill was modeled after the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which created an independent review board of well-respected historians to release documents related to the Kennedy assassination. The historians continued to balance the public interest against the privacy rights of individuals, but the end result was a collection of material far more transparent and informative than what was previously available to students of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s murder. No harm came to any of the thousands of people whose names were released to the public as part of the JFK Act, in part because government agencies could appeal controversial decisions directly to President Bill Clinton, who could override the board\u2019s decisions. All of these safeguards would be in place if the government passes the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Act. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victims of these cold cases have a right to justice, and the people of this country have a right to access these \u201cclassified\u201d files regarding these cold cases. It is not fair to the victims that they do not receive proper compensation and closure in a reasonable time frame, and it is not fair to the American public to deprive them of records and files that they ought to see. As Kennedy said, \u201cThe very word \u2018secrecy\u2019 is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.\u201d Let us heed the president\u2019s words and create this bill to rectify our past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aditya Shah is a junior at Hightstown (N.J.) High School who, along with his Advanced Placement U.S. Government and Politics class, is pushing for congressional introduction and passage of a bill called the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act.

And that\u2019s true when it comes to building walls or rolling back engaging with Cuba or failing to ratify legitimate trade agreements. It\u2019s true of policies that alienate more than 55 million Americans of Hispanic descent, more than 4 million a vast majority of whom are citizens here in the state of Florida. Everyone\u2014everyone\u2014everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. It\u2019s basic. It\u2019s just basic.\u201d\\&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before delivering his remarks, Biden spoke with Mexican President Enrique Pe&amp;ntilde;a Nieto, during which the White House said the vice president \u201cunderscored the importance of Mexico to the United States as a bilateral partner and as a regional leader in Latin America.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both leaders also \u201cpledged to deepen bilateral cooperation on issues such as counter-narcotics, security, and trade to the benefit of the citizens of Mexico and the United States,\u201d according to the readout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over the course of the Obama administration, there has been &amp;quot;literally a shift in attitude about U.S. motives and our willingness to participate,&amp;quot; Biden remarked earlier in his speech.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;And so I\u2019m proud to say that today\u2014I think I can say without fear of contradiction\u2014our relationships in the neighborhood are as good as they\u2019ve ever been in American history,&amp;quot; he said. That does not mean there are not disagreements, but Americans' &amp;quot;willingness to engage with seriousness and with respect has changed the way the leaders and I would argue the people of the region view us,&amp;quot; Biden remarked, from the countries of the Caribbean throughout the Americas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Such an attitude is critical, Biden said, &amp;quot;because the Western Hemisphere is not the same place it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago. Today the nations of the Americas are defined by opportunity by and large, not crisis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Challenges linger, the vice president acknowledged, but there have been &amp;quot;vital shifts,&amp;quot; pointing to the &amp;quot;expansion of trade and regional economic growth [that] has helped bring tens of millions of people out of poverty into the middle class.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Absent from Biden's remarks were any explicit mention about the role that such trade agreements have played in the presidential primary, including in his own party.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;With courage and determination, the people of the region have made democracy the established norm,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;There are exceptions, but it\u2019s become the norm rather than the exception. We\u2019re increasingly seeing political pragmatism replace populism.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Making note of the U.S.' reopened relations with Cuba, Biden remarked upon &amp;quot;new opportunities for U.S. business and emerging Cuban private sector.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;And it's engendered greater personal connection with the citizens of Cuba,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;And here's the thing: I've had a chance to meet every leader of every country in the hemisphere, and the single act of beginning to normalize relationship with Cuba has lifted an enormous burden off them, allowing them much more flexibility to deal with us as they want to do. It's had multiple benefits so far. It's paid important foreign policy dividends.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 17:55:07 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>ngass@politico.com (Nick Gass)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/joe-biden-donald-trump-foreign-policy-dangerous-223070</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Biden 'confident' Clinton will be Democratic nominee</title>\n      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/joe-biden-hillary-clinton-nominee-president-223017</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vice President Joe Biden says he is &amp;quot;confident&amp;quot; that Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic presidential nominee and that she will be the next president, even as the former secretary of state has been unable to shake Bernie Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI feel confident that Hillary will be the nominee, and I feel confident she\u2019ll be the next president,\u201d Biden told ABC's Robin Roberts in an &lt;a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/vice-president-joe-biden-confident-hillary-clinton-democratic/story?id=39014454\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;quot;Good Morning America&amp;quot; published Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden ruled out a presidential run of his own last October and has not endorsed a candidate in the Democratic primary. But until his remarks to ABC, he sought to be even-handed in how he assessed Clinton and Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This country\u2019s ready for a woman,&amp;quot; Biden said during an interview with &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/joe-biden-woman-president-221801\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Mic&lt;/a&gt; last month. &amp;quot;There\u2019s no problem.

Agencies also appear to be pulling the White House in to the handling of seemingly mundane records about travel, when the travelers are members of President Barack Obama's Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While agencies, Republican lawmakers and conservative groups &lt;a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/06/chaffetz-blames-white-house-memo-for-foia-delays-208118\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;have attributed the referrals and ensuing delays to the 2009 Craig memo&lt;/a&gt;, it is unclear whether that directive actually requires referral of a broader set of information to the White House than under earlier memos issued during the Reagan and Clinton administrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cause of Action's lawsuit acknowledges that the Craig memo is vague about what constitutes &amp;quot;White House equities.&amp;quot; The group says that vagueness appears to be leading to unnecessary referrals to the White House. Requesters are often unaware that a White House referral is delaying their request, although POLITICO is aware of cases where such referrals have led to years of delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A White House spokeswoman defended the Obama administration's overall record on FOIA, but declined to comment on the suit. She referred a reporter to a Justice Department spokesman who also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House Counsel Neil Eggleston, his office and 11 federal agencies are named as defendants in the case, which seeks a judicial ruling &amp;quot;that Agency Defendants' compliance with the Craig Memo is unlawful to the extent that it delays compliance with FOIA deadlines.&amp;quot; The case was assigned to Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, a Clinton appointee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 19:20:40 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>jgerstein@politico.com (Josh Gerstein)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/05/watchdog-suit-obama-white-house-slowing-foia-process-223016</guid>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
