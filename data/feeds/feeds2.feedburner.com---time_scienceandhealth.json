The last time we spotted a new world orbiting our sun was in 1930, when amateur astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto&mdash;which wore the planet designation only until 2006, when it was busted down to a mere dwarf planet. Last January, astronomers from Caltech announced they had <a href=\"http://time.com/4184942/planet-9-new-pluto-solar-system/\">evidence of a new Planet Nine</a>, but while it may well be out there, no one&#8217;s seen it yet.</p>\n<p>If planets are in short supply close to home however, across the rest of the galaxy they&#8217;re enjoying a boom market. According findings NASA announced at a midday press conference today, astronomers working with the Kepler Space Telescope have added 1,284 new exoplanets to the roster of known worlds orbiting stars other than our sun. That&#8217;s on top of 984 other exoplanets already confirmed, as well as 1,327 others that are considered likely, but not yet validated.</p>\n<p>Most important, of the newly confirmed planets, nine qualify as the most sought-after type of all: ones less than twice the size of Earth&mdash;which means they likely have solid surfaces&mdash;orbiting their stars in the so-called Goldilocks zone, where the temperature stays within the not-too-hot, not-cold-cold range for liquid water to exist. If life as we know it is going to emerge anywhere in space, planets like that are the first place to look.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"><div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"2\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4876159586001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://ti.me/1T3TpO4\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4876159586001\"></object></div></div><div class=\"clearvideofloat\"></div> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">The newly announced planets were discovered by a combination of precise optics and smart arithmetic. The Kepler telescope, which was launched in 2009 and is now in the slow wind-down phase of its mission, has searched for planets by staring unblinkingly at 150,000 stars&mdash;a tiny sampling of the 300 billion or so in the Milky Way&mdash;looking for the slight dimming of light that occurs when an orbiting planet crosses its face.</span></p>\n<p>That method, however, can yield false positives in a number of ways, especially if a star is actually a part of a binary system and the dimming is caused by its partner star. &#8220;There are a lot of scenarios that mimic the transiting planet signal,&#8221; said Princeton astronomer and Kepler researcher Timothy Morton in a press conference announcing the new finds.</p>\n<p>Eliminating the impostors has historically involved follow-up sightings, which can be exceedingly slow and painstaking. Morton has streamlined this process with a new computer model that factors together the strength of the transiting signal, the size and color of the star, the overall population of stars of that type already known to have planets, the overall stellar population of the galaxy and more. Taken together, these x-factors can determine the likelihood that a possible planet is a real planet to within a certainty of 99%. Only the ones that meet or exceed that threshold make the confirmation cut&mdash;and the 1,284 just announced did.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kepler is interested in statistics,&#8221; said Natalie Batalha, Kepler mission scientist at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. &#8220;We are searching the galaxy to see how far we have to look to find potentially habitable planets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That statistical approach means that not only is the 1,284 number bigger than it seems&mdash;since it is surely just a small representative sample&mdash;so too, is the population of nine new earth-like planets, which themselves joined a rarefied list of 12 other such known worlds. Habitable planets can be missed entirely not just because their small size, but because they may orbit at an angle relative to the Kepler telescope that makes them appear to pass above or below their parent star, thus not causing any telltale dimming.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There can be many, many more planets than they&rsquo;re seeing because the transit is not in the ecliptic relative to Earth,&#8221; says Batalha.</p>\n<p>Follow-on telescopes including the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) which will be launched in 2017 and 2018 respectively, will look for those and other worlds, and Webb particularly may be able to analyze the atmosphere of any earth-like planets that have them, looking for telltale signs of biology like water, methane and carbon dioxide.</p>\n<p>Humanity&#8217;s great cosmic mystery&mdash;whether we&#8217;re alone in the universe&mdash;is still unresolved. But what the 1,284 new planets make clear, is that there surely plenty of worlds out there where life as we know it could find a comfortable home.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4324907&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/scienceandhealth/~4/dsiGIUl3KzQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kepler_all-planets_may2016.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=color&amp;w=150\" />\r\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kepler_all-planets_may2016.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=color&amp;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\r\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kepler_all-planets_may2016</media:title>\r\n\t\t</media:content>\r\n\t<feedburner:origLink>http://time.com/4324907/kepler-new-planets/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>One in Five of the World\u2019s Plant Species Is Endangered, Says Report</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/scienceandhealth/~3/GifUmhhCaOs/</link>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 08:57:58 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Simon Lewis]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[endangered species]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[london]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[oyal Botanical Gardens Kew]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4324142</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Agricultural expansion and palm oil production are among the biggest threats to plant life<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4324142&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\r\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module ad-300-250\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-4324142\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/4324142/endangered-plant-species-kew-gardens/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>One in five of the world&#8217;s known plant species is under threat of extinction, according to the first global<a href=\"http://assets.kew.org/files/State%20of%20the%20Worlds%20Plants%20report%202016_0.pdf?_ga=1.53149992.1481545917.1462867808\"> report</a> on the earth&#8217;s flora.</p>\n<p>Authors of the <em>State of the World&#8217;s Plants</em>, by London&#8217;s Royal Botanical Gardens Kew, recorded 390,000 known plant species and noted that humans have found uses for more than 30,000 of them.</p>\n<p>Out of the species facing possible extinction, almost one-third (31%) is threatened by the destruction of their habitats to meet expanding demand for agricultural land, including the clearing of many of the world&#8217;s forests to make way for palm oil production or cattle farming.

The patriarchal system was&mdash;and in some cultures still is&mdash;based on the premise that women are more mercurial, less deliberative and physically less sturdy than men. Those are perfectly easy beliefs to hold&mdash;at least until you subject them to the least bit of intellectual scrutiny or real-world testing, at which point they fall apart completely.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s, the script flipped, with the fashionable thinking being that gender differences are artificial constructs. Give little girls footballs or model rockets and little boys baby dolls or princess toys and they&#8217;d play perfectly happily with them as long as someone didn&#8217;t tell them otherwise.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p>But this too was mostly rubbish, as any parent who has raised both a boy and a girl can tell you&mdash;and as scientists confirm. The more closely they study brain structure, prenatal hormone exposure and more, the more they confirm that boys and girls are born fundamentally, behaviorally different.</p>\n<p>The question gets a little murkier when it comes to one of the great dividing lines between the sexes: sports. On the one hand, both interest and participation in organized sports is still a predominantly male thing. On the other hand, when any culture makes the effort to level the playing field of opportunity, female participation rises dramatically. In 1972, before the enactment of Title IX, the landmark law that ensured gender equality in educational opportunities, only 7% of high school athletes were girls. Today it&#8217;s 42%.</p>\n<p>Still, according to a <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/ebs0000049\">thoughtful new study</a> published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/ebs/\">Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences</a>, the hard hand of evolution plays at least as much of a role in sports interest and participation as policy does&mdash;and quite possibly a greater one. And that, like it or not, tips the balance in favor of males.</p>\n<p>The research, led by psychologist Robert Deaner of Grand Valley State University in Michigan, was more of a deep analysis of decades worth of other research, which is often the best way to get a high-altitude view of any social science. Deaner and his colleagues began by looking at the basic numbers.</p>\n<p>One 2014 survey of 37 countries, for example, found that in every one, men were likelier to play some kind of sport than women. In a few countries, the difference was not statistically significant, but when the question was narrowed to specify competitive sports like basketball and exclude non-competitive ones like running, the men blew the doors off the numbers, besting women by nearly four-fold. A 2013 study conducted by Deaner and a colleague not involved in the current work found that males were twice as likely as females to be involved or interested in sports across 50 different countries or cultures.</p>\n<p>The non-evolutionary explanations for the imbalance are familiar and numerous. Homemakers, goes one argument, who are still predominantly female, have less free time for sports than men do. In fact, however, research shows that both genders have about the same amount of free hours, but if the women are going to devote some of them to physical activity it&#8217;s likelier to be fitness training like yoga or Pilates or gym workouts. There is also the argument that even in a Title IX world, there still fewer well-organized sports leagues for girls than there are for boys. That may be true, but if the innate interest in sports were really the same across genders, the great leveler of sports in childhood&mdash;pick-up games that kids organize themselves&mdash;would be played more or less equally by all kids. But here the boys hold a ten-to-one edge.</p>\n<p>As for the overwhelming gender disparity in sports spectatorship, the familiar non-evolutionary explanation is that there simply aren&#8217;t enough professional teams and leagues featuring female players to attract female spectators. But experience&mdash;if admittedly limited&mdash;doesn&#8217;t show that. The quality of play is first-rate in the 20-year-old Women&#8217;s National Basketball Association, but the league remains very much a ward of the much larger men&#8217;s NBA, with far smaller audiences and far less public interest as a whole.</p>\n<p>Women&#8217;s professional soccer is taking off around the world, but it&#8217;s men who make up most of the viewership, not women. In Germany, the male share of the audience for women&#8217;s soccer is actually greater than it is for men&#8217;s, 64% to 58%.</p>\n<p>So if it&#8217;s evolution that&#8217;s behind the gender divide&mdash;and Deaner and his colleagues take pains to say it&#8217;s <em>not only</em> evolution&mdash;what exactly are the survival advantages of playing a sport? And what in the world could be the advantage of simply sitting around and watching other people play.</p>\n<p>Much of the answer is based on the phenomenon known as the spectator <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/topic/lek\">lek</a>. Principally found in birds, but also in some species of insect and mammal, a lek involves males gathering in a single place and displaying their plumage, size or overall fitness, sometimes by engaging in mock&mdash;or not-so-mock&mdash;combat, while other members of the species observe. For females, the value of watching the displays is straightforward, since it helps them select the mates who have the fittest genes and can best compete for resources. For male spectators, it has equal, if different, value, allowing &#8220;nonparticipating males [to] monitor the performances so they can evaluate potential competitors and allies,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>\n<p>The precise nature of athletic activities is important too, since so many of them&mdash;running, tackling, throwing projectiles, advancing across terrain (or even around a diamond)&mdash;are useful in warfare. This all serves to refine skills, reinforce alliances and intimidate potential rivals.</p>\n<p>Social status matters too, and sports reliably confers it, enhancing both power and mating options for the participant. That&#8217;s a dividend exploited far more by male athletes than female. It is the rare women&#8217;s sports star who travels with a posse, spends extravagantly on the plumage that is bling or beds a partner in every city in which she plays. It&#8217;s too much to say it&#8217;s the rare male sports star who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> do those things, but it&#8217;s certainly more common among the lads.</p>\n<p>The function of sports as a kind of mortal combat for men is evident even in the way they approach a less directly competitive sport like marathon running, in which all but a tiny handful of participants are not actually contending to win. Overall, three times more males finish the race within 125% of the record time for their gender than females do for theirs, which suggests that the men were more focused on running to win than the women were. That&#8217;s a strategy that often backfires, since men were also three times likelier to slow significantly throughout the race, suggesting that their competitive impulses got out ahead of their abilities, whereas women tend to maintain a smarter, steadier pace.</p>\n<p>None of this means that socialization, gender bias and all of the other cultural variables are not at work in the largely male world of sport. &#8220;An evolutionary approach is fully compatible with socialization playing a large role,&#8221; the researchers write, and so it is. Play has always been a big part of the life of all humans, and sports can be a big part of play. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the genders don&#8217;t still do it in many different ways&mdash;and for many different reasons.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4322947&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/scienceandhealth/~4/aBRW4zp8pcs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/sportsfans.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=color&amp;w=150\" />\r\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/sportsfans.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=color&amp;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\r\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Settle down boys: Players on the champion Leicester City Football Club watch rivals on TV during their championship run.</media:title>\r\n\t\t</media:content>\r\n\t<feedburner:origLink>http://time.com/4322947/men-women-sports-evolution/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>This Photo of Mercury in Transit Across the Sun Is Haunting</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/scienceandhealth/~3/1MaI0ouKLAM/</link>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 18:25:32 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[TIME Photo and Olivier Laurent]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[mercury]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[space]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4323236</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The rare event occurs only about 13 times each century<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4323236&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\r\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s the smallest planet in our Solar System, <a href=\"http://time.com/4322641/mercury-transit-sun/\">but also the fastest</a>, with an orbit of just 88 Earth days.

Take a look at the nighttime sky and all of the other relatively nearby planets show themselves readily.</p>\n<p>Venus is sometimes so bright it&#8217;s mistaken for an incoming airplane. Mars is so distinct we can even make out its blood red color. As for Jupiter and Saturn, well, just try <em>not</em> to see them. Apart from the moon they can be the most distinct objects in the sky.</p>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n<p>But Mercury? Practically invisible&mdash;<a href=\"http://time.com/4315228/mercury-transit-sun-watch-live-stream-online/\">except for this week that is</a>. On Monday, Mercury makes a seven-hour transit of the sun&mdash;from 7:12 a.m. E.T. to 2:12 p.m. E.T.&mdash;appearing as a black speck creeping across the solar disk. If you want to see it, you can watch our livestream above, or you&#8217;d better get yourself to a properly filtered telescope (staring straight at the sun: not good) fast, because the transit happens only 13 or 14 times a century. Here&#8217;s why&mdash;and here&#8217;s why you should care.</p>\n<p>Mercury has gone by a lot of different names in its very long history. The Assyrians called it &#8220;the jumping star&#8221; (in Assyrian, of course); the Greeks called it Stilbon (or &#8220;The Gleaming&#8221;); the ancient Chinese called it Cheng Xing, or The Hour Star. But the winning name came from the Romans, who named the planet after Mercury, the messenger of the gods, as a nod to the fleet path it makes across the heavens.</p>\n<p>Earth takes 365 days to make one circuit of the sun&mdash;which is how we measure our year. Mars, one slot out on the planetary race track, takes 687 days. If you lived on Neptune, your year would be nearly 165 Earth years. Mercury, by contrast, zips around the sun once every 88 Earth days.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s more than four revolutions for every one Earth makes&mdash;which means that we ought see at least four Mercury transits a year, as the planet laps us again and again. But speed isn&#8217;t the only thing, inclination counts too.</p>\n<p>The Earth orbits the sun more or less in the flat, staying roughly in the sun&#8217;s equatorial plane. Mercury&#8217;s orbit is tilted seven degrees relative to Earth&#8217;s, which means that most of the times it passes the sun, it appears to us to be moving above or below it as well&mdash;which eliminates the transit effect. It is only when Mercury&#8217;s orbital plane intersects Earth&#8217;s orbital plane that a transit becomes visible to us&mdash;which is what&#8217;s happening now.</p>\n<p>So why does it matter? First, because Mercury itself matters. It&#8217;s a remarkable little warrior world, one that got clobbered early in its lifetime by a passing planetesimal, unleashing an explosive energy equivalent to one trillion 1-megaton bombs. And yet it survived. It has spent the entirety of its life being blowtorched by the close-up fires of the sun&mdash;losing much of its exterior layers and winding up as a sort of planetary shot put, with its iron core making up 75% of its volume. And yet it survived.</p>\n<p>So props to Mercury.</p>\n<p>More important though, a transit matters because Mercury is so hard to study otherwise. The U.S. and other countries have been throwing spacecraft at planets all over the solar system for decades, with Mars especially humming with active probes. But getting to Mercury is a brutally difficult thing. When you&#8217;re firing a probe so deep into the gravity well of the sun and aiming at a target moving 30 miles per second (48 k/s) there are a lot more ways for things to go wrong than right. It&#8217;s for that reason that Mercury has been visited only twice: a flyby by the Mariner 10 spacecraft in 1973, and an orbital mission by the MESSENGER probe, which circled the planet from 2011 to 2015. There are no current plans for NASA or any other space agency to go back.</p>\n<p>So think of the little planet today, get a properly filtered look at it if you can, and otherwise say goodbye.

Show up at 8:30 p.m. and you&#8217;ll be the only person in the restaurant. Come back at 9:30 and there will be a few other folks&mdash;all Americans, all retirees, all taking advantage of the Spanish equivalent of the early bird special. It&#8217;s only at 10:30 that the Spaniards themselves start to arrive&mdash;with <a href=\"http://time.com/4282023/this-is-what-happens-to-your-brain-on-no-sleep\" target=\"_blank\">bedtime</a> following many hours later.</p>\n<p>(Find out <a href=\"http://time.com/4319909/sleep-habits-country/\">what country you sleep</a> like.)</p>\n<p>The world is home to 196 different countries&mdash;and that means 196 different <a href=\"http://time.com/4269916/arianna-huffington-better-nights-sleep\" target=\"_blank\">bedtimes</a> and wake times. Not everybody&#8217;s personal body clock is perfectly suited to the rhythms of home, of course. There are surely some innately late-rising Americans who struggle with our country&#8217;s crack-of-dawn culture. There are surely some morning larks who get awfully lonely at 7 a.m. in Spain. So what country is best for you? Figuring that out has just gotten easier, thanks to an imaginative study by mathematicians Olivia Walch, Amy Cochran and Daniel Forger of the University of Michigan&mdash;and an interactive test, available here:</p>\n<div id=\"sleep_by_country\" class=\"time-interactive\"><img src=\"http://time-static-shared.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/interactives/sleep_by_country/screenshot.png\" class=\"screenshot\" style=\"width:100%;\"></div><script defer type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://time-static-shared.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/interactives/sleep_by_country/script-min.js\"></script>\n<p>The research, just published in the journal<em> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/\">Science</a></em>, is based on data collected with a simple smartphone app, called ENTRAIN. Designed by the investigators for both Android and Apple devices, the app asks users to input a number of bits of basic information, including their age, gender, country, time zone and daily sleep and wake times, as well as their most common lighting environment: bright indoor, low indoor, bright outdoor, low outdoor. All people encounter all these lighting states in a single day, but the researchers were interested only in the predominant one.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the first year of the study, 8,070 people downloaded and regularly used the app, uploading their information to the researchers&#8217; database. In the second year, nearly 2,000 more joined them, making for a robust sample group that topped 10,000.</p>\n<p>Some truths were consistent across all cultures. Gender is a key determinant of how many hours of sleep any one person gets, with women and girls logging a bit more than men and boys. Bedtime and wake time are determined principally by age. While small children go to bed early and wake up early, the pattern shifts dramatically in the <a href=\"http://time.com/4285012/teens-sleep-deprived\">teen years</a>, with kids going to bed later and sleeping till noon on weekends if they&#8217;re allowed. Throughout adulthood and into old age, the pattern reverses again, as bedtimes and wake times creep earlier and earlier.</p>\n<p>Beyond those broad averages, however, geography and nationality drove the sample group in a variety of directions. For the sake of simplicity and statistical significance, the researchers limited the places they considered to the 20 that submitted the most results: the U.S., Australia, Canada, the U.K., France, Spain, The Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, China, Japan, Brazil, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, Italy, Finland, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates.</p>\n<p>The results, in a lot of ways, ran true to cultural form. The Japanese tend to get up early and go to bed late&mdash;consistent with their reputation for early-rising industriousness and long evenings spent socializing with co-workers. Americans indeed keep retirement community hours, with the fourth earliest bedtime (after Belgium, Australia and New Zealand) and the very earliest wake time. Germany maintains sensible hours in the middle of both charts. The French rival the Spanish for late-night caf&eacute; life, but it&#8217;s Spain and Singapore that are the last in the world&mdash;or at least the last in the sample group&mdash;to hit the lights and call it a day.</p>\n<p>While time of sunrise and sunset do play a role in all of this, it&#8217;s a far smaller one than when we lived in the state of nature. &#8220;There are differences in latitudes [which determine hours of sunlight],&#8221; says Walch, &#8220;but they&#8217;re always engulfed by artificial light and culture.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As newer versions of ENTRAIN are introduced, the developers hope that people will find practical uses for them. Once they have stored enough information about their daily sleep patterns, for example, the app could tell them what their optimum bedtime is, warn them what time of day they&#8217;re likely to crash if they&#8217;ve pulled an all-nighter the day before, and recommend ways to adjust their circadian rhythms when they cross time zones.</p>\n<p>No matter how the app gets used, its help will surely be welcome. In a world divided by way too many things, sleep is one of the great levelers. We&#8217;ve all got to do it and, almost without exception, we&#8217;re all happy for something that offers us ways to do it better.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4318156&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/scienceandhealth/~4/bchoMxYKGVA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/sleep-feet.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=color&amp;w=150\" />\r\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/sleep-feet.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=color&amp;w=150\" medium=\"image\">\r\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Woman lying in bed under sheet (focus on feet)</media:title>\r\n\t\t</media:content>\r\n\t<feedburner:origLink>http://time.com/4318156/sleep-countries-style/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Why We Haven\u2019t Been Able to Stop Wildfires</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/scienceandhealth/~3/31eyV_6ZBXI/</link>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 16:06:04 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Worland]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[climate change]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=4317938</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA['We\u2019re not good at doing maintenance, and then really bad things happen'<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=4317938&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\r\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-4317938\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"http://time.com/4317938/fort-mcmurray-wildfire-prevention/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>Smokey the Bear <a href=\"http://www.smokeybear.com/\">told</a> forest and National Park visitors for decades that they held the health and safety of the areas they visited in their hands. &#8220;Only you can prevent forest fires,&#8221; the character says.</p>\n<p>But as it turns out, Smokey has been lying to us.

During that time period&mdash;and especially over the 20th century with the establishment of the U.S. Forest Service&mdash;we have responded to wildfires extinguishing them as quickly as possible. But that instinct has allowed brush and trees that would normally die off in the occasional fire to grow unabated in some regions. Over time, that excess brush provides extra fuel for fires. So when fires do strike, and they can&#8217;t be controlled, the unencumbered plant growth allows them to burn much more quickly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main self-regulatory mechanism in ecosystems was frequent fires, fires that burned every two to seven years,&#8221; says Wally Covington, a forest ecology professor at Northern Arizona University. &#8220;Those fires were put out by European settlement.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Man-made climate change has also <a href=\"http://time.com/3959260/climate-change-wildfires/\">created more favorable conditions</a> for wildfires. Fires thrive in warm temperatures that have spiked due to global warming. Conditions like climate change-related <a href=\"http://time.com/3849320/california-drought-wildfires/\">drought</a> also increase the likelihood of wildfires. A lack of access to water kills trees and plants and dry conditions transform the brush into a material that ignites easily.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=\"http://time.com/4005231/wildfires-graph/\">This Graphic Shows How &lsquo;Unimaginable&rsquo; Wildfires Are on the Rise</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Due to climate change and other factors, fire seasons tend to be longer and they tend to be drier,&#8221; says Doug Rideout, professor of forest and rangeland stewardship at Colorado State University. &#8220;It turns out that fuel treatment programs can address both.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Newer strategies for controlling wildfires includes a number of different methods for reducing forest and plant life&mdash;the fuel in a forest fire. Government and forest protection officials have increasingly invested in programs to eliminate the extraneous brush that helps fires spread quickly. Prescribed burns are one of the most effective&mdash;and controversial&mdash;methods of reducing fire risk. In a prescribed burn, fire officials set fire to an area vulnerable to fire. Setting controlled fires allows forest workers to remove highly flammable plant material under conditions they know will keep the fire from spreading too rapidly. Prescribed burns also help remove invasive species that might destroy the native habitat, and in turn, create more dead brush that could lead to bigger fires.</p>\n<div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"5\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4877685636001-5\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://ti.me/1Y8r5NT\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4877685636001\"></object></div></div><div class=\"clearvideofloat\"></div>\n<p>The method has grown in popularity in recent years, but still faces challenges, particularly in areas where burns might threaten local air quality. Programs to restore ecosystems to their pre-human state have also gained favor as a way to reduce wildfire risk. Many forests now have somewhere between 300 and 700 trees per acre, a dramatic increase from the 15 to 50 trees per acre pre-human influence, according to Covington. Thinning forests makes the remaining trees healthier and more likely to withstand wildfires. The method also helps natural wildfire to thrive in forests. And, even if forest officials cannot thin entire forests, treating small areas can create buffer zones that prevent future fires from growing out of control.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=\"http://time.com/3992447/technology-wildfire-predictions/\">This Technology Could Help Predict Where Wildfires Strike Next</a></p>\n<p>Efforts to implement these preventive methods have expanded in recent years, but experts say funding needs to expand rapidly before wildfires can be slowed across the globe. Governments have devoted billions of dollars to addressing wildfires, but the money has largely gone to putting out existing fires, even as the number and severity of increases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not good at doing maintenance, and then really bad things happen,&#8221; says Chris Topik, director of the Restoring America&#8217;s Forests program for The Nature Conservancy. &#8220;Last year the wildfire season was terrible, worst in decades.
