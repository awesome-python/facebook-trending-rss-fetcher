(AP Photo/Felipe Dana)</p></div>\n<p>BRASILIA, Brazil \u2013 Picking up Brazil&#8217;s reins after the Senate voted to suspend President Dilma Rousseff, acting President Michel Temer pledged Thursday to jumpstart the stalled economy and push ahead with a sprawling corruption investigation that has already ensnared top leaders of his own party and even implicated Temer himself.</p>\n<p>Temer spoke in the same narrow hall where a defiant Rousseff made what may prove her last remarks as president earlier in the day. He reached out a timid olive branch to his two-time running mate, saying he wanted his appearance to be &#8220;sober&#8221; in recognition of his &#8220;institutional respect&#8221; for Rousseff and of the deep divisions caused by the impeachment campaign against her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is not a moment for celebrations, but one of profound reflection,&#8221; Temer said at a chaotic swearing-in ceremony for the 22 members of his new Cabinet. &#8220;It&#8217;s urgent to pacify the nation and unify the country. It&#8217;s urgent for us to form a government of national salvation . to pull this country out of the serious crisis in which we find ourselves.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Senate voted 55-22 to impeach Rousseff over allegations her government broke fiscal laws in managing the federal budget. Rousseff insisted the accusations are baseless, since such financial manoeuvrs have been common practice by other Brazilian presidents without repercussions.</p>\n<p>She was immediately suspended for 180 days pending a trial in the Senate. If she is found by two-thirds of the Senate to have committed crimes, Temer will serve out the remainder of her term, which ends in December 2018.</p>\n<p>Rousseff maintained the action against her amounts to a &#8220;coup&#8221; cooked up by power-hungry opponents bent on rolling back the clock on government social programs that wrenched an estimated 35 million Brazilians out of poverty during the 13 years in power by her left-leaning Workers&#8217; Party.</p>\n<p>She has said the &#8220;chief conspirator&#8221; against her was Temer, the longtime leader of the centrist Democratic Movement Party that is known less for a specific ideological stance than for its skill at backroom deal making.</p>\n<p>Speaking just before leaving the presidential palace, Rousseff said she wouldn&#8217;t give up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am the victim of a great injustice,&#8221; said the former Marxist guerrilla who rose to power in 2010 on the coattails of her wildly popular predecessor and mentor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I fought my whole life and I&#8217;m going to keep fighting,&#8221; she said, signalling that she and her supporters may intend to make good on a promised campaign of protests and strikes that could complicate Temer&#8217;s government.</p>\n<p>Analysts say Rousseff&#8217;s lack of skill as a politician and Brazil&#8217;s tanking economy played major roles in her undoing. The economy is expected to contract nearly 4 per cent this year after an equally dismal 2015, and inflation and unemployment are hovering around 10 per cent, underscoring a sharp decline after the South American giant enjoyed stellar growth for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>Making matters worse for Rousseff, the big graft scheme at Brazil&#8217;s state-run Petrobras oil company revealed deep-seated corruption that cuts across the political spectrum, ensnaring top officials from the Workers&#8217; Party and the opposition alike as well as top businessmen.</p>\n<p>Temer has been implicated by witnesses in the scandal, but he has not been charged. The impeachment drive&#8217;s main motor, former House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, has been charged in the scandal and was suspended last week as speaker over allegations of corruption and interfering with justice.</p>\n<p>While Rousseff supporters have voiced worries that Temer might try to undermine the Petrobras probe, the acting leader promised that it would continue unfettered.</p>\n<p>The probe has become a &#8220;reference,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and as such it deserves to be followed closely and protection against any interference that could weaken it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several of Temer&#8217;s Cabinet appointees have also been ensnared by corruption charges and other allegations.</p>\n<p>His choices also raised eyebrows because they are all middle-age or elderly white men _ a particularly sore point in this majority non-white country. Six women, including one black, were included in the 39 members of Rousseff&#8217;s Cabinet when she began her second term last year.</p>\n<p>Answering claims by Rousseff the he intends to dismantle the social programs that now benefit around one-fourth of the Brazilian population, Temer insisted Thursday that the programs would not only be maintained but &#8220;perfected&#8221; under his leadership.</p>\n<p>Still, Temer also said his first order of business will be putting the economy back on track and grappling with the government budget deficit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our biggest challenge is to staunch the process of freefall of our economy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;First of all, we need to balance our public spending. The sooner we are able to balance our books, the sooner we&#8217;ll be able to restart growth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Temer&#8217;s inaugural address as interim president was marred by several bizarre moments, including a stampede by photographers who sprinted out of the packed event to shoot police using pepper spray on a small group of pro-Rousseff demonstrators outside the palace.</p>\n<p>The acting president also lost his voice halfway through the speech, his face turning red and voice constricting to a croak until an aide gave him some lozenges.</p>\n<p>The chaotic ceremony contrasted with the motto of Temer&#8217;s government \u2013 &#8220;order and progress,&#8221; which is the aspirational phrase emblazoned on the Brazilian flag.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The expression on our flag couldn&#8217;t be more current if it was written today,&#8221; Temer said.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/brazils-acting-president-promises-to-jumpstart-economy/\">Brazil&#8217;s acting president promises to jumpstart economy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/brazils-acting-president-promises-to-jumpstart-economy/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Conservatives and NDP say Trudeau&#8217;s wife shouldn&#8217;t get extra staff</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/conservatives-and-ndp-say-trudeaus-wife-shouldnt-get-extra-staff/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/conservatives-and-ndp-say-trudeaus-wife-shouldnt-get-extra-staff/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 02:07:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=873491</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Sophie Gregoire suggested this week she is overwhelmed</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/conservatives-and-ndp-say-trudeaus-wife-shouldnt-get-extra-staff/\">Conservatives and NDP say Trudeau&#8217;s wife shouldn&#8217;t get extra staff</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_844707\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/02-5.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-844707\"><img src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/02-5.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Gr\u00e9goire-Trudeau, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, places her hand over her heart while participating in a program at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, Thursday, March 10, 2016, to highlight Let Girls Learn efforts and raise awareness for global girl&#039;s education.

Rachel La Corte/AP</p></div>\n<p>EDMONTON \u2013 The man who has been the face of the fire fight in Fort McMurray is taking some time off.</p>\n<p>Wood Buffalo fire Chief Darby Allen told reporters Thursday \u2013 10 days after fire first spread into the northern Alberta city \u2013 that he is handing control to others tasked with returning people to the community and rebuilding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m OK at putting out fires and getting people out. But the next phase is not mine,&#8221; Allen said, at one point choking back tears while thanking his wife and two grown sons for their support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be honest, I need a break,&#8221; Allen said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to spend time with my family and we&#8217;re going to hug a lot and I&#8217;m going to have a couple of beers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll rejuvenate myself and I&#8217;ll be back in a week or so and I&#8217;ll get on with being a fire chief again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Allen has been one of the people leading the battle against the wildfire that swept into the city last week and his heartfelt updates on social media have made him a celebrity of sorts.</p>\n<p>More than 2,400 homes and buildings were destroyed in the blaze and 530 were damaged, but firefighters under Allen&#8217;s charge have been credited with saving up to 90 per cent of the oilsands capital.</p>\n<p>Several Fort McMurray firefighters also lost their own homes while working to save others. Officials say Allen&#8217;s house is still standing.</p>\n<p>A 500-page report will likely be written about the beastly fire someday, said the chief, but until then he believes the most important call made was for the mandatory evacuation of more than 80,000 residents when the fire first entered the city May 3.</p>\n<p>Four pets died in the fire, he said, and two people were killed in a car crash during the evacuation. A CBC Radio-Canada videographer was also taken to hospital in critical condition Thursday following a crash near one of the evacuation points, Lac La Biche.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s incredible there weren&#8217;t more casualties, Allen said.</p>\n<p>Crews continued to snuff out flareups Thursday, while inspectors assessed damage.</p>\n<p>Municipal Affairs Minister Danielle Larivee said key goals are making sure the fire is completely out, restoring utilities and ensuring the hospital is functional.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s especially important in an isolated region like Fort McMurray where the next nearest hospital is hours away, she told a briefing in Edmonton.</p>\n<p>Larivee expects it will take five days to assess all structures in the city, but emphasized there is still no fixed date for a return.</p>\n<p>The military is pulling out, but Brig.-Gen. Wayne Eyre, commander of Joint Task Force West, said personnel will remain on high alert throughout the summer.</p>\n<p>Fire official Chad Morrison said cooler weather has helped crews battle the blaze, which has grown to more than 2,400 square kilometres and is still raging in the forest to the east. Infrared scanners show there are still hot spots outside the city.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have had a bit of a break here &#8230; but we are going to see more hot, dry weather starting Saturday,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The good news with that is we will continue to see some southwest winds that will push the fire away from the community into the remote forested areas.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That being said, we are long from over in this fight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/fort-mcmurrays-fire-chief-gets-a-rest-as-city-moves-toward-recovery/\">Fort McMurray&#8217;s fire chief gets a rest as city moves toward recovery</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/fort-mcmurrays-fire-chief-gets-a-rest-as-city-moves-toward-recovery/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>B.C.

The step reduces the lag of waiting for data from the coroner&#8217;s office.</p>\n<p>But the number of deaths has continued to grow, despite increased outreach initiatives, aggressive awareness campaigns and the rapid distribution of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the declaration of the public-health emergency, with increased availability of naloxone (and) with the increased number of first responders available to administer it, I&#8217;m hopeful that this month we&#8217;ll start to see those numbers come down,&#8221; said Lake.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But it really is something that we have to continue to talk about, to make sure people are very aware.&#8221;</p>\n<p>B.C.&#8217;s medical health officer Perry Kendall said he wasn&#8217;t surprised by the update.</p>\n<p>&#8220;(Overdose deaths) haven&#8217;t gone down yet, but I didn&#8217;t really think that they would have,&#8221; he said on Thursday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This obviously means we need to work on them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kendall predicted last month that if the number of fatalities continued to rise at this rate, the total could exceed 800 by year&#8217;s end.</p>\n<p>The Fraser Valley region leads the province with a total of 76 overdose deaths in the first four months of 2016. That&#8217;s followed by 66 deaths in Metro Vancouver and 54 on Vancouver Island. There have been 45 overdose fatalities in the Interior and 15 in Northern B.C.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/b-c-health-minister-predicts-record-drug-overdose-deaths-this-year/\">B.C.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld</p></div>\n<p>OTTAWA \u2013 New measures to scrub self-serving and partisan government communications will take effect immediately, says Treasury Board President Scott Brison \u2013 but that doesn&#8217;t mean the Liberals will put the brakes on federal ad spending.</p>\n<p>The new &#8220;interim&#8221; safeguards include banning all government ads within three months of a fixed election date and barring the government from advertising policies that have not yet been passed by Parliament.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the very first time we are defining non-partisan communications in policy to avoid any potential confusion, misinterpretation, or abuse,&#8221; Brison told a news conference Thursday, promising ads that are &#8220;objective, factual and represent a legitimate public service announcement.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We just want to make it absolutely clear that we are ending the ability for any government, current or future, to use tax dollars to fund what are partisan or quasi-partisan ads.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The former Conservative government earned years of criticism for its aggressive Tory-blue branding that melded party and policy, sloganeering and persuasion, in one seamless, whole-of-government campaign under the &#8220;Economic Action Plan&#8221; motif. The ubiquitous EAP signage still dots the country.</p>\n<p>Those Conservatives came to office in 2006 riding public anger over the Liberal sponsorship scandal, an advertising scandal that resulted in criminal convictions and a public inquiry.</p>\n<p>The new government policy covers everything from the federal identity program (no more &#8220;Harper Government&#8221; in official communications) to public opinion research and barring party-hued colour schemes and the images, voices or names of MPs or senators in ads.</p>\n<p>The 2015 Liberal election platform promised to create an advertising commissioner, housed in the federal auditor general&#8217;s office, to review all government ads, but Thursday&#8217;s interim measures fell short of that commitment.</p>\n<p>Instead, the government will pay $65,000 annually to have Advertising Standards Canada \u2013 the private ad industry&#8217;s self-regulating body \u2013 review all government ads.</p>\n<p>Brison said the auditor general has been asked to audit the program and that feedback will be used to draft legislation entrenching the changes at some future date.</p>\n<p>Janet Feasby, vice-president of standards at Advertising Standards Canada, said in an interview they expect to handle between 50 and 60 government ads each year, in English and French.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be done by the same (three) staff that currently reviews complaints under the Canadian Code of Advertising Standards in our Toronto and Montreal office,&#8221; said Feasby.</p>\n<p>Ads will be reviewed twice _ in the planning stage and again after production but before airing. If the ASC determines they breach the new standards, Treasury Board will withhold funding, said Brison.</p>\n<p>Political advertising is not part of the ASC&#8217;s mandate but it does handle increasing numbers of public complaints over government ads.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the last few years we&#8217;ve certainly gotten more,&#8221; said Feasby.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Rose, a political communications specialist at Queen&#8217;s University who has served on the Ontario government&#8217;s ad vetting panel, called the policy measures &#8220;a great step forward in reforming federal government advertising.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s comfortable with the ASC&#8217;s role but eventually would like to see the vetting done through an office that&#8217;s accountable to parliament.</p>\n<p>Alex Marland, a political science professor at Memorial University who has extensively researched government communications, said the policy changes are long overdue.</p>\n<p>The Conservatives spent $761.5 million on government ads from 2006 through March 2015 _ not including last spring&#8217;s pre-election bonanza \u2013 and the Liberals are not signalling they&#8217;ll shut off the taps.</p>\n<p>The first Liberal budget promised $221 million in annual cuts on professional services, travel and government advertising. But Brison did not mention ad budget cuts Thursday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get into the mug&#8217;s game of saying what is the appropriate level (of spending),&#8221; Brison said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In terms of the overall dollar value, I think the most important thing is we focus on the principles that government advertising needs to actually provide public benefit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Marland said federal advertising concerns cross party lines and go straight back to the sponsorship scandal of the 1990s. In fact, Brison was part of a previous Liberal effort to clean up the ad game when, as public works minister, he delivered the 2003-04 government advertising annual report with a pledge to &#8220;ensure that Canadians get the most benefit possible from government of Canada advertising.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Almost a billion dollars in taxpayer-funded ads later, that clean-up begins again.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It would have been nice to see (these changes) a long time ago,&#8221; said Marland, the author of &#8220;Brand Command: Canadian Politics and Democracy in the Age of Message Control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/liberals-move-to-curb-partisan-advertising/\">Liberals move to curb partisan advertising</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/liberals-move-to-curb-partisan-advertising/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Canada will not commit to doubling defence spending</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sorry-trump-canada-isnt-committing-to-doubling-defence-spending/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sorry-trump-canada-isnt-committing-to-doubling-defence-spending/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:56:25 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Panetta, The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Harjit Sajjan]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=873409</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>'We had 158 soldiers who died \u2014 sacrificed \u2014 in Afghanistan.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick</p></div>\n<p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Canada isn&#8217;t committing to a massive boost in military spending, such as is being demanded of U.S. allies by Donald Trump as part of his presidential election platform.</p>\n<p>Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan was asked during a visit to Washington about the request that NATO allies meet their stated goal of spending two per cent of GDP on the military.</p>\n<p>Trump warned recently that allies should be prepared to defend themselves without any American help if they won&#8217;t bother following through on the international spending goal set years ago.</p>\n<p>Sajjan expressed skepticism Thursday about the value of that two-per-cent yardstick, without committing to it or ruling it out. He said the government will seek a plan that works for Canada, and for its allies, through its current review of defence policy.</p>\n<p>There are other ways to calculate a country&#8217;s contribution, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had 158 soldiers who died \u2014 sacrificed \u2014 in Afghanistan. Having been alongside them, contributions can be measured in many different ways,&#8221; said the minister, a veteran of the Afghan war.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We as Canada will make a decision based on what type of military capability, size, composition, is going to be needed for Canada \u2014 but more importantly how we integrate with our multilateral partners.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The minister&#8217;s language echoes that of the discussion paper put out by the government for its ongoing review, which suggests the two-per-cent target is a questionable measure for calculating military effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Canada would need to double its spending to reach that target. It&#8217;s currently in the bottom tier of NATO countries in terms of spending, at one per cent of the national economy.</p>\n<p>Reaching the target would require another $20 billion per year \u2014 the equivalent of nearly the entire federal employment insurance program, or half of health transfers to the provinces.</p>\n<p>But NATO countries signed onto that target a decade ago. It&#8217;s been a source of annoyance to politicians in the higher-spending countries that only four nations have reached the target.</p>\n<p>Trump made it a theme of his recent foreign-policy speech \u2014 attached to a threat.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our allies must contribute toward the financial, political and human costs of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so,&#8221; he said recently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have spent trillions of dollars over time \u2014 on planes, missiles, ships, equipment \u2014 building up our military to provide a strong defence for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defence \u2014 and, if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-goes-to-washington-and-things-get-awkward/\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump goes to Washington\u2014and things get awkward</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>An international observer of military spending calls the two-per-cent figure arbitrary, essentially political, and unconnected to real security requirements.</p>\n<p>But he said the recent invasion of Ukraine has increased pressure on NATO allies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think given the political climate, most NATO members who are currently below two per cent \u2014 i.e. most of them \u2014 will be reluctant to reduce military spending, and may increase it slightly, unless faced with poor economic conditions,&#8221; said Sam Perlo-Freeman, head of the Project on Military Expenditure at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As Canada is one of the lowest spenders as a share of GDP, it would be in particular politically awkward to further cut spending.

(Paul Sancya/CP)</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TORONTO &#8211; A global organization of scientists and bioethicists has released updated guidelines for research using stem cells, the so-called &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of regenerative medicine, stressing that the protection of patients must take precedence as the field continues to rapidly evolve.</p>\n<p>The guidelines developed by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) are aimed at assuring both the medical field and the public that research using these powerhouse cells is conducted with scientific and ethical integrity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;ISSCR&#8217;s overriding goal is to improve human health through stem cell research,&#8221; society president Sean Morrison told a media telebriefing Thursday. &#8220;That means promoting sound and rigorous science as well as accelerating the translation of that research to help patients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It also means opposing the marketing of unproven stem cell therapies to patients,&#8221; said Morrison, head of the Children&#8217;s Medical Center Research Institute at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.</p>\n<p>Dr. George Daley, director of the stem cell transplantation program at Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital, said the ISSCR is aware there&#8217;s &#8220;an industry already out there&#8221; that is marketing unproven stem cell therapies directly to patients.</p>\n<p>Indeed, there is a growing international medical tourism business, in which patients desperate for treatments for serious or life-threatening illnesses travel to countries where unregulated clinics offer stem cell-based therapies that have not been proven to work and in some cases may be unsafe.</p>\n<p>High-profile examples include former hockey great Gordie Howe, who travelled to Mexico in late 2014 for stem cell injections after suffering two debilitating strokes. Family members believe the therapy vastly improved the now 88-year-old&#8217;s symptoms at the time, although Canadian stem cell experts questioned whether the experimental and unapproved treatment was responsible.</p>\n<p>In December, friends of Spirit of the West frontman John Mann, who has early-onset Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, organized a crowdfunding campaign to help the Canadian musician pay for an experimental stem cell treatment not available in Canada or the U.S.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s facilitated by the Internet, it&#8217;s facilitated by the international scope of medical care, it&#8217;s facilitated by rather weak regulatory structures in some countries and it is part of the concern that&#8217;s really raised the alarm and is part of the impetus behind having these guidelines,&#8221; explained Daley, who helped craft the recommendations.</p>\n<p>There are many kinds of stem cells in the body, but much of the research focuses on embryonic stem cells and what are known as induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs. Both have the power to give rise to almost any type of cell in the body, from brain and heart to kidneys and bone. But iPSCs are developed from adult tissues like skin cells, which can be chemically manipulated in the lab to return to an embryonic-like state.</p>\n<p>While research using stem cells derived from donated embryos is allowed in Canada, the U.S. and several other countries, the guidelines recommend some restrictions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The ISSCR holds that scientific research on preimplantation-stage human embryos is ethically permissible when performed under rigorous scientific and ethical oversight, especially in the areas of human development, genetic and chromosomal disorders, human reproduction, and new disease therapies,&#8221; the document states.</p>\n<p>However, the group warns against scientists going too far when it comes to the use of new gene-editing tools such as CRISPR/CAS, which allows researchers to remove minute slices of DNA with incredible precision. The technology could be used, for instance, to remove a mutated gene that causes an inherited disease.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is obviously very important for biomedicine, but it also raises more challenging ethical questions, such as whether we should use the technology to edit embryos,&#8221; said Daley, who&#8217;s also a professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at Harvard Medical School.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But we draw a very clear distinction given that there&#8217;s uncertainty about the safety of gene editing of embryos and not yet any kind of social consensus on whether it should be practised.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although using such tools to modify the genome of human embryos can be used for basic lab-based science to advance biomedical knowledge, Daley said using altered embryos for human reproduction is premature and should be prohibited &#8220;at this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While stem cells hold great promise, with hopes they could some day be harnessed to create replacement organs and cure such conditions as Parkinson&#8217;s disease, macular degeneration-related blindness, diabetes and spinal cord injuries, the guidelines also caution researchers against &#8220;hyping&#8221; their results to the media and public.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Scientists are often very excited by their findings and occasionally scientists and others can overstate either the clinical promise or the timelines needed in order to convert a finding into a clinical application,&#8221; said Jonathan Kimmelman, a bioethicist at McGill University who chaired the 25-member international task force that updated the previous 2006 and 2008 guidelines.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The guidelines clearly urge scientists to balance their communications with each other, as well as with the public,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and to make sure that the projected clinical applications are not unrealistically optimistic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rigorously designed patient trials that emphasize the safety and efficacy of any experimental therapy are the gold standard of medical research, and that holds for stem cell research efforts as well, the guidelines stress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No doubt the path forward will be fraught with setbacks and not all of the clinical trials will work, but we believe that these trials will lead to new insights that will increase our chance of curing some of these diseases,&#8221; added Morrison, referring to Parkinson&#8217;s and other debilitating and often life-shortening disorders.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And even if we only succeed some of the time, it will change the world for subsets of patients who are currently beset by these terrible conditions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Details of the guidelines and related articles were published Thursday in a number of journals, including Nature, Science and the Lancet.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/health/guidelines-on-stem-cell-research-put-patients-first-warn-against-hype/\">Guidelines on stem cell research put patients first, warn against hype</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/society/health/guidelines-on-stem-cell-research-put-patients-first-warn-against-hype/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Paul Martin: Canadians not racist, but aboriginal issue invisible to many</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/paul-martin-canadians-not-racist-but-aboriginal-issue-invisible-to-many/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/paul-martin-canadians-not-racist-but-aboriginal-issue-invisible-to-many/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:30:25 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kristy Kirkup, The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Indigenous]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Paul Martin]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=873351</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Former prime minister Paul Martin: 'It is my belief if we speak about [Indigenous issues] ... more and more Canadians are becoming aware of it'</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/paul-martin-canadians-not-racist-but-aboriginal-issue-invisible-to-many/\">Paul Martin: Canadians not racist, but aboriginal issue invisible to many</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_873353\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-873353\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ajw104339673_high.jpg\" alt=\"Former prime minister Paul Martin poses for a portrait following an interview with The Canadian Press in Ottawa, Thursday May 12, 2016.

Unfortunately, the invisibility of the aboriginal issue in this country is something that has been locked in by history, but it is my belief if we speak about &#8230; more and more Canadians are becoming aware of it.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>From the archives: </strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/welcome-to-winnipeg-where-canadas-racism-problem-is-at-its-worst/\" target=\"_blank\">In Winnipeg, Canada&#8217;s racism problem is at its worst</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>He also said supports Cindy Blackstock, who spent nine years fighting the government over aboriginal policy and won a landmark ruling from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in January.</p>\n<p>It found Ottawa discriminated against First Nations kids in funding child welfare services on reserve.</p>\n<p>Addressing the child welfare problem will require money, but also working in partnership with advocates, Martin said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is first money, it is second recognizing that we have to work with the First Nations,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are tremendous child welfare advocates out there, people who are very knowledgeable, people like Cindy Blackstock and what the government has to do is to work with them &#8230; for cultural reasons, traditional reasons, and just simply that&#8217;s where the expertise lies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Working together could produce results quickly, he added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t do it if we are turning our back on them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Cindy Blackstock is right.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Martin&#8217;s voice lends credibility to the notion that First Nations children are worth the money and can succeed, given the proper opportunity, Blackstock said.</p>\n<p>She noted, however, the current government&#8217;s commitment of $71 million for the issue in this year&#8217;s budget falls far short of what is required to close the gap.</p>\n<p>&#8220;(It&#8217;s) going to mean more investment from the federal government for equitable child welfare services and more flexibility in the way that the funds are rolled out, so it can actually meet the needs of children,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now, the funding is totally not based on the needs of kids and that needs to change.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/paul-martins-very-own-class-reunion-on-parliament-hill/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Martin&#8217;s class reunion on Parliament Hill</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Martin said his Liberal government had child welfare services on reserves in its sights when it drafted the Kelowna Accord \u2014 the 2005 funding agreement with aboriginal leaders and the provinces that was abandoned by Stephen Harper&#8217;s Conservatives.</p>\n<p>He said the former government&#8217;s refusal to honour the agreement still robs him of sleep.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It starting keeping me up at night at the day the Conservatives did it,&#8221; Martin said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It made no sense in the world and has it bugged me for 10 years? Absolutely.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How can you go along and say to a six-year-old going into Grade 1 that you&#8217;re not going to get the same type of education as a six-year-old kid who is living 10 miles from you.

Pallister&#8217;s Progressive Conservatives routed Premier Greg Selinger and the NDP to put an end to 16 years of orange power. THE CANADIAN PRESS/John Woods</p></div>\n<p>WINNIPEG &#8211; Manitoba&#8217;s new Progressive Conservative government has laid down spending restraints for all government departments while it gets a handle on the province&#8217;s financial picture.</p>\n<p>A memo from the provincial treasury board, obtained by The Canadian Press, directs deputy ministers in all departments to refrain from new spending on office relocations, furniture and information technology projects.</p>\n<p>The memo also requires all travel and advertising to be &#8220;scrutinized closely&#8221; and outlines new restrictions on hiring, except for critical health and safety positions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Effective immediately, staffing requests for all vacant positions will require treasury board approval,&#8221; the memo reads.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition &#8230; departments are directed to employ their best efforts to minimize non-essential spending.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The treasury board is a committee of cabinet ministers responsible for the government&#8217;s fiscal management.</p>\n<p>Finance Minister Cameron Friesen, who chairs the board, said the Tories are sending out a clear signal that they will follow through on promises to curb spending increases. The Tories won the largest majority in Manitoba in a century on April 19 \u2014 40 of 57 legislature seats \u2014 and captured more than 50 per cent of the popular vote.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What this memo represents is first steps. It&#8217;s going to provide direction. It&#8217;s going to give ministers and deputy ministers in departments assurances that we will do what we set out to do,&#8221; Friesen said Thursday.</p>\n<p>The memo says the constraints are in place &#8220;until rescinded.&#8221; Friesen said there will be more direction in the budget, expected around the end of the month or early June.</p>\n<p>The Tories promised during the election campaign to slow the growth in government spending while protecting front-line services. They promised to work toward a balanced budget but have not set a target date.</p>\n<p>The previous NDP government started running deficits in 2009 and twice pushed back its target for balanced budgets. The province was not hit directly by the 2008 recession, but suffered from expensive flood damage, a $300-million a year cut in equalization payments and other financial factors outside its borders.</p>\n<p>The ongoing deficits occurred despite tax increases and prompted Moody&#8217;s, an international bond rating agency, to downgrade the province&#8217;s credit rating last year.</p>\n<p>The NDP projected a deficit of $773 million in March, but it was an estimate and not based on final numbers for the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>The new restraints will also ensure ministers in the new government learn quickly about their departments, Friesen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re making sure that, as work is prepared and needs authorization, the minister is having to put eyes on a page. That&#8217;s going to foster discussion, they&#8217;re going to get into that with their deputy ministers and they&#8217;re going to know their role increasingly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/manitoba-tories-tell-government-departments-to-curb-spending-hiring/\">Manitoba Tories tell government departments to curb spending, hiring</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/manitoba-tories-tell-government-departments-to-curb-spending-hiring/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Quebec minister refuses to sign off on new, controversial history course</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebec-minister-refuses-to-sign-off-on-new-controversial-history-course/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebec-minister-refuses-to-sign-off-on-new-controversial-history-course/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:22:44 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Quebec]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=873339</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The contentious plan was introduced by the Parti Quebecois government before it lost the 2014 election</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebec-minister-refuses-to-sign-off-on-new-controversial-history-course/\">Quebec minister refuses to sign off on new, controversial history course</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_873341\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CPT107339660_high.jpg\" alt=\"Quebec Education and Family Minister Sebastien Proulx responds to the Opposition during question period at the legislature in Quebec City in this April 28, 2016, file photo.

(Jacques Boissinot/CP)</p></div>\n<p>MONTREAL &#8211; A proposed high school history course that critics said ignored minorities in Quebec and promoted a rigid, nationalist ideology will not be implemented provincewide as planned, the Education Department confirmed Thursday.</p>\n<p>Instead, the department will make changes to the program to better reflect the province&#8217;s cultural and linguistic minorities, according to a government official as well as other well-placed sources.</p>\n<p>The contentious plan was introduced by the Parti Quebecois government before it lost the 2014 election and was being piloted in a few Quebec schools.</p>\n<p>Department spokeswoman Marie-Eve Dion said schools that want to try piloting the new program in August 2016 will be allowed to do so while all others will stick to the old curriculum until further notice.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many consultations have been done and improvements are constantly being implemented,&#8221; she said in an email. &#8220;The goal is to make the course as representative and inclusive as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The program was to be introduced provincewide in the 2016-17 school year, which begins in late August.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is absolutely good news,&#8221; said Sylvia Martin-Laforge, head of the Quebec Community Groups Network, a federally funded organization that advocates for the province&#8217;s anglophone community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We understand that the minister was not happy with the material. It would seem that people were eager (in the Education Department) to roll out this program and the minister had the courage to say &#8216;No. We will not roll this out.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>The proposed two-year program, called History of Quebec and Canada, was widely panned by First Nations groups, as well as by cultural and linguistic minority communities across the province.</p>\n<p>Documents obtained by The Canadian Press revealed that non-European francophone immigrants are scantily mentioned.</p>\n<p>In the guidelines teachers use to craft their lesson plans, Confederation in 1867 is not a theme, but tucked into the larger section called &#8220;1840-1896: The formation of the Canadian federal system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moreover, the only discussion of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, considered the father of multiculturalism in Canada, is in the context of him &#8220;inviting the provincial governments to reopen the Canadian Constitution,&#8221; after which Quebec left &#8220;empty-handed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Martin-Laforge said &#8220;we can only hope that the depictions of minority communities will not be stereotypical and that the new program doesn&#8217;t characterize us as bad guys.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jacques Beauchemin, who helped write the proposed curriculum, told The Canadian Press earlier this year the purpose of the program was to remove mentions about Quebec being a diverse society that promotes multiculturalism.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"

(CBC/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>FORT MCMURRAY, Alta. &#8211; The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is sending specialists to Fort McMurray to help emergency crews check out radiological devices that may have been affected by the wildfire.</p>\n<p>The equipment \u2014 which includes radiography cameras used to check welding work and portable gauges to measure density of roadways \u2014 is all in packaging designed for safe transport and to survive building or vehicle fires.</p>\n<p>The commission said it received a request for assistance from Alberta&#8217;s provincial emergency operations centre. Two specialists in radiation safety were en route Thursday.</p>\n<p>Luc Sigouin, the commission&#8217;s director of emergency management programs, stressed it is a precautionary move.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s important to highlight that we don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s any risk associated with any of the radiation devices or sources in the area,&#8221; Sigouin said in a phone interview from Ottawa. &#8220;They&#8217;re built very robustly and take into account fire protection and resistance to fire.

There are about 20 locations in the Fort McMurray area that have radiological devices that need to be checked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If, unfortunately, the storage site had been affected by fire, they will take radiation measurements to confirm whether the device has been affected by the fire, whether the radiation safety properties of the devices have been affected and we&#8217;ll go from there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More than 2,400 homes and buildings were destroyed in the blaze and 530 were damaged, but firefighters have been credited with saving up to 90 per cent of the city.</p>\n<p>The flames also burned over a radioactive waste site just south of Fort McMurray.</p>\n<p>The waste is from the 1930s to the 1950s, when uranium ore was transported from the Northwest Territories to the railhead at what is now Fort McMurray. Some of the uranium spilled along the route. The cleanup was completed in 2003.</p>\n<p>Maude-Emilie Page, communications director for Atomic Energy of Canada, said the site has about 43,000 cubic metres of low-level radioactive waste made up of low-grade uranium ore residue and contaminated soil.</p>\n<p>She said the site is fenced in, capped with a thick layer of soil and basically looks like grassy hills. The vegetation burned, but there&#8217;s no worry about the site catching fire, she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The thick soil cover remains intact. There&#8217;s really no risk to the health and safety of the public or the environment,&#8221; said Page.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once we are able to go back in, there might be some re-seeding activities to put the vegetation cover back on, but that&#8217;s about it for what we can see for now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/nuclear-safety-commission-specialists-go-to-fort-mcmurray-in-precautionary-move/\">Nuclear safety commission specialists go to Fort McMurray in precautionary move</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/nuclear-safety-commission-specialists-go-to-fort-mcmurray-in-precautionary-move/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Sophie&#8217;s role: What do we expect of prime ministers&#8217; spouses?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sophies-role-what-do-we-expect-of-prime-ministers-spouses/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sophies-role-what-do-we-expect-of-prime-ministers-spouses/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:38:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Shannon Proudfoot]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=873297</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>As Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau copes with her workload, we talk to an expert about the 'vague, ambiguous' role of the PM's wife</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sophies-role-what-do-we-expect-of-prime-ministers-spouses/\">Sophie&#8217;s role: What do we expect of prime ministers&#8217; spouses?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_873317\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-873317\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MAY12_GREGOIRE_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, holds their son Hadrien Gr\u00e9goire while she greets students from D.C.'s Patterson Elementary School, after arriving at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Wednesday, March 9, 2016.

(Cliff Owen/AP)</p></div>\n<p>Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau has recently spoken up about the fact that there are too many public demands on her time to juggle with the minimal staff she\u2019s been allotted. Which raises the question: Exactly what do Canadians expect of their prime minister\u2019s spouse, and what are they willing to supply to help them do the job? <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> asked Elizabeth Goodyear-Grant, an associate professor of political science at Queen&#8217;s University, who specializes in gender and elections.</p>\n<h4>Q: How would you sum up the role of the prime minister\u2019s spouse?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Vague. Ambiguous. It\u2019s not institutionalized the way it is in other countries; the U.S. would be the most stark comparison. It\u2019s an apparatus in the U.S. The First Lady\u2019s office is an official component of the White House, and she has a very large staff. She actually has a person on the payroll in charge of floral.</p>\n<p>In the Canadian case, that institutionalization is not there at all. What it means is that over time, as the person in the position changes, the duties and public face of the prime minister&#8217;s spouse changes, too.</p>\n<p>If we look at Stephen Harper\u2019s wife, she was basically a non-entity in public. She maintained real distance from political life and just kept doing her own thing. Whereas other prime ministers\u2019 wives &#8211; and Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau is one of them &#8211; have been involved quite closely.</p>\n<h4>Q: What does that lack of definition mean for the role in Canada? Does it make it more difficult to navigate, or does that give them more freedom?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Probably both to some extent, but on balance I think it makes it more difficult. Especially for someone like Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, who is obviously committed to participating in and enhancing her husband\u2019s political career. Because she doesn\u2019t have the resources she needs to do it. Let\u2019s think back to the fall, when the public\u2014and some journalists\u2014raised this big stink about the fact that there were paid nannies accompanying them on official visits where she was expected to perform a host of duties. And part of the story that\u2019s come out now is she\u2019s saying she\u2019s overtaxed. Basically, her rope is fraying.</p>\n<p>Now, we don\u2019t need to go to the extent that the First Lady\u2019s office has in the United States, but there could probably be a stronger formalization of the resources and structure of the role.</p>\n<h4>Q: How would you define the First Lady role in the U.S.? What are the expectations there?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> She\u2019s like the mother of the nation, isn\u2019t she? Part of the reason why things are so formalized and so well-resourced in the U.S. is that the ceremonial and diplomatic functions of the U.S. president are so much more extensive than most other jurisdictions in the world. She, as a host, has a lot on her plate\u2014more than the Canadian prime minister\u2019s wife\u2014and she always will. Being the most important country in the world comes with that. That\u2019s part of the reason for the difference.</p>\n<p>But not only is she expected to be the host on state dinners and state visits, the First Lady has, going back to Eleanor Roosevelt, had her own very well-developed policy agenda. So if we think about Michelle Obama, it\u2019s been kids\u2019 fitness and obesity, and she\u2019s had all these formal initiatives. She plays a very overt political role, and the public expects that and in many cases, embraces it. If we think of Hilary Clinton when she was First Lady: welfare reform and education reform. Nancy Reagan: war on drugs. There were these really strong policy roles.<br />\nThere\u2019s more acceptance of a strong political role, and that could also play a role in how well-structured and well-resourced the apparatus around first spouses is. I suspect that if first spouses in Canada became as political as they are in the U.S., there could be some pushback.</p>\n<h4>Q: It seems like that is a line they are trying to walk with things like the nannies. To even say that Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau needs more help or staff, right away you could see the eyes rolling, right?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Not just about the prime minister\u2019s wife, but about a lot of public officials: let\u2019s do the countdown to someone mentioning the taxpayer\u2019s dime. But you don\u2019t see that in the U.S. with the extravagance of the White House and the First Lady, and also senators and congresspeople and governors. Americans expect it and wear it as a badge of pride, like, \u2018We\u2019re the best country in the world. You\u2019re goddamn right we\u2019re having caviar at the state dinner.&#8217; They see it as a show of economic strength.</p>\n<p>To be quite frank, Canadian public sentiment about providing these kinds of things for public officials is really cheap. Remember when Justin Trudeau was first elected and they were taking a look at the state of 24 Sussex, and how it\u2019s crumbling? They act as though it\u2019s going to be Jacob Zuma in South Africa spending $55 million on the house. Our purse strings are very tight, especially for public figures we see as somehow less legitimate because there\u2019s no electoral basis.</p>\n<h4>Q: How much of the demand in Canada right now would you attribute to branding? It seems like a lot of the interest in the Trudeaus is, shall we say, aesthetic rather than political?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> There\u2019s a lot of that. Let\u2019s not also forget her own background, in that she is a media personality in Quebec and she was quite a prominent one. She\u2019s obviously someone who enjoys the public eye, together with Justin Trudeau\u2014they both enjoy it and have been successfully using it politically. That\u2019s not a critique, it\u2019s just an observation.</p>\n<p>And she is also part of constructing this happy, healthy, beautiful young family image\u2014the beautiful, vivacious, intelligent, devoted mother is a very necessary component of all that. In a sense, it\u2019s quite traditional, gender-wise. Especially if we compare it to someone like Harper\u2019s wife or even going way back, to Joe Clark\u2019s wife, Maureen McTeer.</p>\n<h4>Q: In the U.S., the First Spouse role has always been a lady. How might that role evolve if Hilary Clinton were to win the presidency?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> It\u2019s kind of a funny case, because the First Gentleman would be a former president in his own right, so he has this legitimacy about him politically that wouldn\u2019t be typical. And he\u2019s always been wildly popular, no matter what he did. He would be given leeway to do whatever he wanted. Now, I think it would become less gendered in the hosting functions of the office, the attention to what they\u2019re wearing, and going on all the daytime talk shows\u2014the things that First Ladies have often done would probably be diminished. But it\u2019s a bit difficult to sort of divorce it from thinking about Bill Clinton in that role.</p>\n<h4>Q: Do you ever get a sense when people are critiquing Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau that they\u2018re bringing other things to that have nothing to do with her specifically? It seems like she is a bit of a projection screen.</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> She becomes a target for critics of her husband, critics of Justin Trudeau\u2019s attention to aesthetic. Not just how they look and what their family looks like, but all the staged events. Of course, politicians always do these, but there seems to be a perception that this is excessive in his case\u2014all the selfies, the self-focus basically, and then capitalizing on that for political gain. Some of that is directed at her as well, as though she\u2019s just a prop, so why are we giving her a nanny or why does she have staff?</p>\n<h4>Q: I was thinking about anxieties and criticisms of working mothers.</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> She does have a job\u2014she\u2019s the first lady of Canada. We should give her a paycheque, probably! [Laughs] There is a crew of staff that comes with the prime ministership. In addition to that house, you get people to cook for you, clean for you, shop for you. And if you have children, part of that is people to mind your children. The problem, too, is we often don\u2019t have young people in the executive position, so it\u2019s unusual to have these requirements.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve felt really badly for Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau at times, actually, because of all of this intense scrutiny and criticism of her and her family. She gets into the public eye, and it\u2019s all venom. I think it\u2019s really brave of her for speaking up and saying, \u2018Look, I\u2019m overburdened and I need help.\u2019</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sophies-role-what-do-we-expect-of-prime-ministers-spouses/\">Sophie&#8217;s role: What do we expect of prime ministers&#8217; spouses?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/sophies-role-what-do-we-expect-of-prime-ministers-spouses/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>10</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples &#8216;should not be scary&#8217;: Bennett</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/un-declaration-on-rights-of-indigenous-peoples-should-not-be-scary-bennett/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/un-declaration-on-rights-of-indigenous-peoples-should-not-be-scary-bennett/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:31:11 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Bruce Cheadle, The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Carolyn Bennett]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=873309</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>What does Canada's support of the UN declaration mean?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/un-declaration-on-rights-of-indigenous-peoples-should-not-be-scary-bennett/\">UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples &#8216;should not be scary&#8217;: Bennett</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_873311\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-873311\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CPT110339133_high.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett talks with reporters at a meeting of the Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nations Chiefs Secretariat in Halifax on Wednesday, in an April 27, 2016, file photo.

(Andrew Vaughan/CP)</p></div>\n<p>OTTAWA &#8211; There&#8217;s nothing frightening about adopting and implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett said Tuesday at the UN.</p>\n<p>Bennett earned a standing ovation from a UN forum in New York by announcing that Canada is now a full supporter of the 2007 declaration, &#8220;without qualification.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But what that declaration signifies in the Canadian context depends on who you ask.</p>\n<p>In the words of one lawyer who represents indigenous resource interests: &#8220;Treaty making starts again today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>UNDRIP, the acronym by which the declaration is known, describes a global set of collective and human rights covering indigenous issues including language, identity, culture and traditions, health and education and free, prior, informed consent over resource extraction. The declaration is not considered legally binding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What does this mean for Canada now?&#8221; Bennett told the UN&#8217;s permanent forum on indigenous issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It means nothing less than a full engagement on how to move forward with adoption and implementation, done in full partnership with First Nations, the Metis nation and Inuit peoples.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Canada is uniquely placed, she said, because it is one of the few states in the world that has already incorporated indigenous rights, in Section 35 of the 1982 Constitution Act.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By adopting and implementing the declaration, we are excited that we are breathing life into Section 35 and recognizing it now as a full box of rights for indigenous peoples in Canada,&#8221; said the Liberal minister.</p>\n<p>Canada was one of four countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the United States, that voted against the declaration when it was first passed in 2007 \u2014 even though Canadian diplomatic officials had helped draft the original declaration.</p>\n<p>The former Conservative government initially argued that the &#8220;free, prior and informed consent&#8221; provisions amounted to a de facto indigenous veto on major resource projects, and questioned how UNDRIP could be accommodated within existing Canadian constitutional protections.</p>\n<p>Bennett did not directly address those concerns Tuesday, but said the declaration fits within Canada&#8217;s long history of treaty and constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be honest: implementing UNDRIP should not be scary,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Recognition of elements of the declaration began 250 years ago with the Royal Proclamation, which was about sharing the land fairly. UNDRIP reflects the spirit and intent of our treaties.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The country&#8217;s two largest resource extraction industry associations welcomed the adoption of UNDRIP, with both the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and the Mining Association of Canada saying the declaration largely mirrors practices already adopted by resource companies over the past decade.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are opportunities to recast relationships,&#8221; Brian McGuigan, CAPP&#8217;s manager of aboriginal policy, said in an interview with The Canadian Press.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of our companies feel they already achieve a lot of what&#8217;s required by UNDRIP in a corporate context and in a resource development context.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pierre Gratton, president and CEO of the mining association, presented the Liberal government&#8217;s position as correcting a historical anomaly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been historically seen as a leader but then we had this funny situation at the UN where we were a dissenter on something that was so important to indigenous peoples worldwide,&#8221; Gratton said in an interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This move really puts us back where we properly belong and also where I think, in practice, we have largely been.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Larry Innes, a lawyer with Toronto firm Olthuis, Kleer and Townsend who represents First Nations groups, said resource industries are &#8220;looking a bit in the rear-view mirror&#8221; in their assessments of UNDRIP.</p>\n<p>Consultation with indigenous communities on mitigation measures for major resource projects has become established practice, but free, prior and informed consent means much more than that, Innes argues.</p>\n<p>Comments this week from Bennett and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould suggest a new nation-to-nation relationship is indeed in the works.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to be dismissive of this as a lot of fuzzy warmth,&#8221; said the lawyer, whose clients include the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in the heart of oilsands country.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But for those of us who have been in the trenches on this for a while, we&#8217;re hearing different things today than we have in the past.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, governments have taken the view that Section 35 is a mostly empty vessel until courts read rights into it through litigation, said Innes.</p>\n<p>Bennett on Tuesday acknowledged Section 35 entails a full suite of rights, with UNDRIP as the backdrop.</p>\n<p>Treating indigenous peoples as governments to be consulted rather than simply stakeholders is &#8220;a whole new ball game,&#8221; said Innes. &#8220;Treaty making starts again today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/un-declaration-on-rights-of-indigenous-peoples-should-not-be-scary-bennett/\">UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples &#8216;should not be scary&#8217;: Bennett</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/un-declaration-on-rights-of-indigenous-peoples-should-not-be-scary-bennett/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Donald Trump goes to Washington\u2014and things get awkward</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-goes-to-washington-and-things-get-awkward/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-goes-to-washington-and-things-get-awkward/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:19:31 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Allen Abel]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Washington]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[paul ryan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[U.S. election 2016]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[washington]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=873193</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Trump was followed by his usual band of backers and detractors, but left his meeting with GOP leaders uncharacteristically speechless</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-goes-to-washington-and-things-get-awkward/\">Donald Trump goes to Washington\u2014and things get awkward</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_873233\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MAY13_ABEL_POST01.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-873233\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-873233\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MAY13_ABEL_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"A self proclaimed undocumented immigrant member (R) of 'United We Dream' protests outside the Republican National Committee building in Washington, DC, USA, 12 May 2016.

More are expected to get back to work over the coming days.</p>\n<p>But even temporary closures in the economically important industry are expected to have an impact on the Canada-wide real gross domestic product.</p>\n<p>In many cases, the updated real GDP projections also reflect disappointing economic data releases in recent weeks for trade and the labour force.</p>\n<p>Since the fire, TD knocked its 2016 real GDP projection down to 1.6 per cent from 1.9 per cent \u2014 0.2 percentage points of which it attributed to the wildfire.</p>\n<p>BMO clipped its prediction to 1.6 per cent from 1.8 per cent \u2014 evenly dividing the blame for the drop between the poor economic numbers and the disaster.</p>\n<p>CIBC lowered its outlook from 1.6 per cent to 1.5 due entirely to the fire.</p>\n<p>At this early stage, however, economists stressed that their predictions remain in flux as officials and companies gain a better understanding of the situation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Anyone who is doing this today is still making some big guesses about how the oil facilities and the rest of the town are going to come back,&#8221; said CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld.</p>\n<p>Forecasters expect the wildfire to contribute to flat growth or even a contraction in the second quarter of the year. They now expect the economy to rebound with stronger growth in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>BMO chief economist Doug Porter said losing activity early in a given year, even if it&#8217;s regained later on, usually means the economy will still suffer a slight loss for the year as a whole.</p>\n<p>The wildfire, which has spread across about 2,300 square kilometres and continues to burn, destroyed about 10 per cent of Fort McMurray&#8217;s 25,000 buildings. More than 80,000 people were evacuated from the northern Alberta community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thank goodness most of the city was spared \u2014 the vast majority of it \u2014 and fortunately most of the (oilsands) facilities were, at the end of the day, unaffected,&#8221; Porter said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It certainly could have been much worse.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Todd Hirsch, chief economist for ATB Financial, said a week ago there was talk of a &#8220;worst-case scenario&#8221; where it would be weeks or even months before operations restarted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Workers are returning and the situation with the fire has been, I guess, perhaps not quite as bad as what was first feared, although still tragic and a disaster,&#8221; Hirsch said Thursday.</p>\n<p>Still, the fallout from the wildfire and the production shutdowns were severe enough to compound ongoing troubles in a province that has been Canada&#8217;s economic engine for years.</p>\n<p>Before the fire, the provincial and federal treasuries were already under intense fiscal pressure from still-low oil prices that started to plummet nearly two years ago.</p>\n<p>Both governments are expected to allocate large sums to cover the costs of things like firefighting and reconstruction.</p>\n<p>For example, Ottawa spent more than $1.3 billion to respond to the massive 2013 floods in southern Alberta and southeastern British Columbia, according to a February report by the parliamentary budget officer.</p>\n<p>Porter said the federal government should have more than enough cushion with its much-debated, $6-billion annual risk adjustment that it included in its March budget.</p>\n<p>The government has said it included the contingency padding, which was much-larger than usual, in case the country&#8217;s economic performance turns out to be weaker than experts have predicted.</p>\n<p>Critics have said the Liberals made the adjustment bigger than necessary to allow them to reap the political benefits of beating expectations.</p>\n<p>But even with the unexpected wildfire costs, Porter still expects the Ottawa&#8217;s 2016-17 shortfall to be smaller than the projection of nearly $30 billion outlined in the budget.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would say it&#8217;s early days yet to talk about the fiscal implications, although I suspect the federal government will contribute heavily,&#8221; Porter said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t dare put a figure on it at this point.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"

Duda was on the base to meet with Canadian Armed Forces personnel who participated in Operation REASSURANCE in Poland. (Sean Kilpatrick/CP)</p></div>\n<p>Andrzej Duda, it turns out, gives as good as he gets. Poland&#8217;s president was in Toronto, Niagara-on-the-Lake and Ottawa this week to meet with business leaders, members of Canada&#8217;s substantial Polish diaspora\u2014and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as both leaders prepare for the Warsaw NATO summit in July.</p>\n<p>Duda&#8217;s visit was politically delicate for Ottawa&#8217;s Liberals. Trudeau and Foreign Minister St\u00e9phane Dion are eager to reassert Canada&#8217;s support for Poland&#8217;s eastern neighbour Ukraine, and for Poland as a key ally in NATO and the EU. But Ottawa has kept abreast of a\u00a0constant stream of critical Western coverage of Duda&#8217;s party, the socially conservative Law and Justice (whose Polish acronym is &#8220;PiS,&#8221;) which won both the presidency and a parliamentary majority in separate elections last year. <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/polands-bad-turn-1452122970\" target=\"_blank\">Editorials</a>\u00a0and comments in interviews and opinion articles from such prominent Polophiles as <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/05/03/poland-vs-history-museum-gdansk/\" target=\"_blank\">Timothy Snyder</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/24/polish-leaders-using-war-museum-to-rewrite-history-says-academic\" target=\"_blank\">Norman Davies</a> have criticized the new government for stacking public institutions, silencing critics, advancing a tendentious view of Polish and European history, and prosecuting internal grudges at the expense of Poland&#8217;s obligations within Europe and NATO.</p>\n<p>In the end, the Trudeau government reached the same conclusion\u00a0most of Poland&#8217;s European allies have reached: that while it can take a dim view of individual government decisions, Poland is too important to ostracize. Trudeau met with Duda, but they did not meet reporters together. <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> requested an interview with Duda during his visit but was told he had time only to respond, in writing, to written questions submitted in advance. The questions were sent on Friday; the president&#8217;s answers arrived on Wednesday. Some of the questions were intended to provoke, and Duda was not shy in responding. Here is his exchange with <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em>:\u00a0<span id=\"more-872413\"></span></p>\n<h4>Q: The <a href=\"http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/248984,Foreign-Minister-discusses-Warsaw-NATO-Summit-in-Bratislava\" target=\"_blank\">NATO summit in Warsaw in July</a> will be preoccupied with challenges on NATO&#8217;s southern border, including the migrant crisis. Do you worry that NATO is too worried about the south and has not paid enough attention to the east?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> The Alliance must be based on the concept of solidarity and co-responsibility. That&#8217;s why there should be no division between the east and the south. Security cannot be divided. NATO must guarantee equal status to all its members and monitor all threats. The Warsaw summit should yield exactly such an outcome. We should forge a collective strategy for the east and the south, aimed at protecting the territory of all member states, protecting peace, protecting international law\u2014no matter where the current threats come from. It means that the eastern flank should be strengthened through defence infrastructure and reconnaissance capabilities. Meanwhile the southern flank needs a clear mandate for common action. I am convinced the Warsaw summit will bring us some definitive answers in this respect.</p>\n<h4>Q: What are Poland&#8217;s specific military requests along NATO&#8217;s eastern border? <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/world/europe/nato-russia-poland.html\" target=\"_blank\">Some reporters have suggested about 5,000 troops could be stationed</a> in Poland and the Baltics, on a rotating basis. Would that be enough?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I have been saying repeatedly: specific quantities do not matter. NATO should demonstrate that it is capable of creating new forces which would protect its eastern flank. It would constitute an enormous change. NATO must show it is a living, vibrant alliance. The threat from the east is not temporary. International rules have been trampled on, the sanctity of borders have been violated. Therefore I want NATO&#8217;s presence in the eastern flank to be substantial and adequate, considering the level of insecurity in our region. Specific numbers and specific locations are still subject to negotiation. From our point of view having American, Canadian or British troops on a rotating basis in Poland and in the Baltics would be an enormous boon to our defence capabilities. Not only in terms of physical presence. Regular joint exercises mean higher level of combat readiness and better coordination in command\u00ad-and-\u00adcontrol. This is particularly important taking into account the changing face of modern battleground. There are new challenges NATO must adapt to: from hybrid activities to cyberwarfare.</p>\n<h4><strong>Q:</strong> Elections produced two new governments in the fall of 2015: Justin Trudeau&#8217;s Liberal government in Canada, and a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-election-idUSKCN0SL1XH20151027\" target=\"_blank\">PiS parliamentary majority in Poland</a>. Have you seen any change in Canada&#8217;s response to the Russian challenge in Ukraine, and toward NATO in general, since last autumn that are worth bringing to the public&#8217;s attention?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Canada and Poland should further their efforts to reinforce the Ukrainian democracy. There has been a string of Polish\u00ad-Canadian initiatives aimed at strengthening the civic society in Ukraine and improving the democratic process at the municipal level. Both Poland and Canada should be advocates of long-\u00adlasting, peaceful solutions in eastern Ukraine, based on unconditional respect of international law.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_873147\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-873147\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11559862-1024x725.jpg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, left, shakes hands with Polish President Andrzej Duda before the start of a bilateral meeting on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Tuesday May 10, 2016.

(Fred Chartrand/CP)</p></div>\n<h4><strong>Q:</strong> The new PiS government has been controversial, not only in Poland. In April the European Parliament passed a motion saying it &#8220;is <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN0XA1AP\" target=\"_blank\">seriously concerned that the effective paralysis of the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland poses a danger to democracy</a>, human rights and the rule of law.&#8221; Why does the PiS government not take the EU&#8217;s concerns seriously?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> This is an internal political conflict, triggered by the previous governing coalition. It attempted to take ownership of the Constitutional Tribunal, violating&#8230; the constitution (which was later confirmed by the Constitutional Tribunal itself in one of its rulings). If they had succeeded, right now the opposition parties would have 14 out of 15 judges of their own choosing. Sadly, the head of this institution, Mr. Andrzej Rzepli\u0144ski, was actively promoting those unconstitutional amendments. He assumed the role of a politician, going far beyond his mandate. The current majority is just trying to restore pluralism and balance in the Constitutional Tribunal and is seeking to reach a compromise with the opposition.</p>\n<h4>Q: While in Canada you will visit with many Polish-Canadians. What will you tell them about Poland&#8217;s decision to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-refuses-to-take-a-single-refugee-because-of-security-fears-a7020076.html\" target=\"_blank\">accept no more migrants from Syria</a> and the surrounding region?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Poland is ready to admit every refugee who arrives in Poland, fleeing the war in the Middle East, no matter their faith or economic status, provided that they comply with our legal regulations and want to stay in our country. The point is that very few of them choose Poland as their final destination. That&#8217;s why we strongly oppose the relocation quotas and penalties that the European Commission is trying to impose on all member states. We cannot forcefully retain migrants in Poland. What if they wish to travel to Germany, Denmark or Sweden? What if they want to join their families in Hamburg or Malm\u00f6? Should we detain them? Restrain their freedoms? This policy is hardly &#8220;humanitarian.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>Q: Poland&#8217;s government is considering legislation that would make it a criminal offence to suggest Polish responsibility for the Holocaust. The Nazi regime&#8217;s murderous coercion of ordinary Poles is well known, as is the Polish people&#8217;s fierce resistance. But surely that resistance was not unanimous? Surely it should be acceptable <a href=\"http://forward.com/opinion/339141/how-poland-is-targeting-holocaust-scholar-jan-t-gross-for-the-sin-of-rememb/\" target=\"_blank\">for historians to examine the role individual Poles played during the war years</a>, even if some contributed to the Nazi atrocities?</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Over six thousand Poles are listed in the Yad Vashem Institute as the Righteous Among the Nations. Can you name at least one of them? Probably not. Their sacrifice was mostly anonymous. A few weeks ago I had the honour to participate in the opening ceremony of a museum in Markowa, in southern Poland, commemorating the martyrdom of the Ulma family. During the war they saved a Jewish family from extermination. And they paid for this heroic deed with their own lives. All members of the Ulma family were slaughtered by Germans. All eight of them, including small children. Is this story really so well-\u00adknown abroad? I don&#8217;t think so. The name &#8220;Markowa&#8221; doesn&#8217;t appear too frequently in foreign media, unlike the outrageous term &#8220;Polish death camps.&#8221; Do you know that in war\u00adtime Poland, as opposed to many other countries in Europe, the Germans were unable to install a puppet regime? Do you know that the Polish government in exile and the Polish Underground Army appealed for all Poles to help Jews, in spite of the fact that the people who hid their Jewish neighbours faced instant execution? The new government has no intention to sue historians who investigate Polish anti\u00ad-Semitism. Their books are not only &#8220;acceptable,&#8221; they are necessary to fully understand all intricacies of the common history of Poles and Jews. Alas, for many years, we have witnessed a process of shifting blame for the Holocaust on others. No, we were not responsible for the Holocaust. The German Nazi regime was. Full stop.</p>\n<h4>Q: PiS governments have been preoccupied with <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21693499-conservatives-and-liberals-are-still-struggling-over-meaning-polands-post-communist\" target=\"_blank\">establishing that many Poles, still alive, collaborated with the Communists</a> during the Cold War. How could their collaboration with an authoritarian regime cause them public blame, while an earlier generation&#8217;s interaction with an earlier oppressor, the Nazis, becomes a forbidden topic of historical investigation? This looks like a serious double standard.</h4>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> No, it doesn&#8217;t. As I said before, there was no Polish puppet regime steered by Germans during the war. Acts of anti\u00ad-Semitism and atrocities committed by individuals were unacceptable but rare. But we have admitted the truth. We have recognized the fact that some Poles behaved hideously under occupation. Conversely, most communist apparatchiks were neither prosecuted nor officially condemned for what they did in the &#8217;50s or in the &#8217;80s. After the fall of communism many of them lived unmolested in their villas, cashing in hefty pensions. And many Poles who collaborated with the regime continued their careers in academia, business, politics. Can you spot the difference? I&#8217;ll give you one telling example. When Mr. Jan Tomasz Gross&#8217;s books about Polish anti-\u00adSemitism were published in Warsaw, they were widely acclaimed by liberal critics. Meanwhile historians who were trying to describe the involvement of current elites in the communist system of oppression were ostentatiously discredited and ostracized. Yes, double standards were applied in Poland, but the other way round.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/polands-president-on-nato-refugees-his-critics-and-the-burden-of-history/\">Poland&#8217;s president on NATO, his critics and the burden of history</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/polands-president-on-nato-refugees-his-critics-and-the-burden-of-history/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Judge sides with House Republicans against health care law</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/judge-sides-with-house-republicans-against-health-care-law/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/judge-sides-with-house-republicans-against-health-care-law/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:05:18 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Associated Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Washington]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Affordable Care Act]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Obamacare]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Rosemary Collyer]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=873087</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally spending federal money to fund the president&#8217;s health care law.<br />\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge Rosemary&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/judge-sides-with-house-republicans-against-health-care-law/\">Judge sides with House Republicans against health care law</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally spending federal money to fund the president&#8217;s health care law.</p>\n<p>The ruling from U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer is a win for House Republicans who brought the politically charged legal challenge in an effort to undermine the law.</p>\n<p>At stake is $175 billion the government is paying over a decade to reimburse health insurers for reducing co-payments for lower-income people.</p>\n<p>The House argued that Congress never specifically appropriated that money and has denied the administration&#8217;s request for it. It says the administration is spending the money anyway, exceeding its constitutional authority. The administration has said it is using other, previously approved money.</p>\n<p>Collyer issued an order stopping further reimbursements, but said it would not take effect pending an appeal.</p>\n<p>House Republicans authorized the lawsuit in 2014 over Democratic objections. The House had already voted dozens of times to repeal all or parts of the law known as &#8220;Obamacare,&#8221; but most of those efforts went nowhere in the Senate and with President Barack Obama in the White House.</p>\n<p>The disputed subsidies help lower-earning people afford out-of-pocket costs such as annual insurance deductibles and co-payments when they visit doctors.</p>\n<p>The White House had earlier argued that the House had no legal authority to pursue its lawsuit, but Collyer rejected that argument and allowed the case to proceed.</p>\n<p>The administration is expected to appeal Thursday&#8217;s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>\n<p>Collyer is a George W.

There was a lot of\u00a0looking back with misty nostalgia and peering ahead with equally shining uplift,\u00a0all of it goosed by\u00a0the giddy, back-slapping energy of people who haven&#8217;t been together in the same room in a long time.</p>\n<p>Room 237-C,\u00a0where the unveiling took place\u2014commonly known as the Reading Room\u2014was crammed with twice as many people as would have\u00a0comfortably fit, and\u00a0wiltingly\u00a0hot. Guests\u00a0fanned themselves with their tasselled programs, or simply sweated into their shirt collars. At\u00a0the front of the room, the portrait awaited its audience behind one of those miniature\u00a0red velvet ceremonial curtains that are simultaneously\u00a0grandiose and a bit\u00a0absurd.</p>\n<p>Loud, prolonged\u00a0applause and cheers greeted the arrival of the &#8220;official party&#8221; of Martin, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Geoff Regan, the speaker of the House of Commons, and George Furey, the speaker of the Senate. The applause soon dissolved\u00a0into rhythmic clapping and chants of &#8220;Paul! Paul! Paul!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The jocular tone was set early on, when Claudette Commanda, opening the proceedings with an Indigenous greeting, addressed the men at the centre of the\u00a0dais\u00a0as &#8220;Right Honourable Prime Minister Trudeau&#8221; and &#8220;Honourable Paul Martin.&#8221; Her accidental demotion of\u00a0Martin drew loud laughs from\u00a0the room\u00a0and Martin himself.</p>\n<p>Regan opened the speeches by reciting a chronology of Martin&#8217;s career, beginning with\u00a0his birth into a political family.\u00a0&#8220;Now, some of us on this stage have an inkling of what effect that can have on a boy\u2019s career choices sooner or later,&#8221; Regan noted. Trudeau grinned at the floor, shook his head and glanced over at the speaker\u00a0from\u00a0beneath arched\u00a0eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Throughout the speeches, each mention of Martin&#8217;s career highlights acted\u00a0like an applause-o-metre on an old-school game show. Paying down the national debt as finance minister and ushering in a string of budget surpluses was\u00a0the accomplishment that sent the arrow\u00a0shooting off the chart. The Kelowna Accord with First Nations, aid for developing economies\u00a0and improving the federal government&#8217;s\u00a0relationships with cities played well, too. &#8220;It is that commitment to building better opportunities for Indigenous peoples, for Canadians and for the entire global community that I will think of when I pass the portrait we are about to unveil,&#8221; Trudeau said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_873031\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-873031\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MAC22_MARTIN_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Former prime minister Paul Martin gestures to his official portrait as he speaks following its unveiling during a ceremony on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Wednesday May 11, 2016.

(Adrian Wyld,\u00a0CP)</p></div>\n<p>At the very back of the room, someone trilled out a brief faux drum-roll when\u00a0Martin took his place next to the painting. As the little curtain drew back, the former prime minister raised his eyebrows in delight\u2014he had already seen the portrait\u2014and\u00a0turned toward the room, as though to say, &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; He gestured to the painter, Paul Wyse, sitting in the front row, and Wyse stood to acknowledge the applause.</p>\n<p>Martin began speaking\u00a0by noting how emotional the day was for him; it was an unnecessary\u00a0confession, given his red-rimmed eyes. He had requested\u00a0an unusually kinetic setting for a prime ministerial portrait, choosing to be depicted\u00a0in the midst of the bustling\u00a0House of Commons because, he said, &#8220;Parliament must reclaim centre stage as the place where those choices are made.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At one point, Martin&#8217;s youngest grandchild, one-year-old Lara, began to fuss, and Martin\u00a0called out to his escaping daughter-in-law to stay\u00a0while he told a story. Early in his political career, during the crescendo of\u00a0one of his first big speeches, a baby started crying, he recalled. &#8220;I was younger and considerably more pompous,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Madam, Madam, don\u2019t take your son out of the room.\u00a0 He is not bothering me.&#8217; And she yelled out, &#8216;Yeah, but you sure are bothering him.&#8217; &#8221;\u00a0The punchline drew huge laughter\u00a0and applause, and Lara settled.</p>\n<p>Martin&#8217;s address was awash in personal nostalgia\u2014he recalled that his first caucus meeting\u00a0had taken place in\u00a0that same room, though he received considerably less applause then\u2014and\u00a0glowing rhetoric about what can be accomplished in Parliament,\u00a0if only they could all stop shouting at each other. More than once, the former prime minister\u00a0addressed the new MPs, staffers and bureaucrats in the room. &#8220;Why are you here?\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You\u2019re here because it is possible to do more good in five minutes in government than it is anywhere else in five months.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At some point, the class reunion feel of the day had shifted to a valedictory address.</p>\n<p>As\u00a0Martin wrapped up, standing next to the paint-and-canvas likeness that will represent him for posterity,\u00a0his\u00a0message\u00a0began to sound\u00a0much\u00a0like a grown-up, Parliament Hill\u00a0version of Dr. Seuss&#8217;s <em>Oh, The Places You&#8217;ll Go!</em>\u00a0&#8220;If there are times when you get a little discouraged\u2014which will happen\u2014I would suggest that you walk down the corridor where the prime ministerial portraits are hanging,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Stop and listen closely, because you\u2019ll be hearing every single one of us cheer you on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/paul-martins-very-own-class-reunion-on-parliament-hill/\">Paul Martin&#8217;s very own class reunion on Parliament Hill</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/paul-martins-very-own-class-reunion-on-parliament-hill/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Donald Trump and Paul Ryan pledge to work together</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-pledge-to-work-together/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-pledge-to-work-together/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:57:13 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Associated Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Washington]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[paul ryan]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=873003</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>'Trump's candidacy is strengthened with an endorsement from the most powerful person, top-ranking Republican in the country' </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-pledge-to-work-together/\">Donald Trump and Paul Ryan pledge to work together</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_868135\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-868135\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MAC19_SOLOMON_POST.jpg\" alt=\"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign stop at the Palladium at the Center for the Performing Arts on May 2, 2016 in Carmel, Indiana.

(Joe Raedle,\u00a0Getty)</p></div>\n<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-on-the-next-phase-of-his-campaign/\">Donald Trump</a> and House Speaker Paul Ryan pledged to work together despite their differences after a meeting Thursday <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/key-senate-republicans-swing-behind-trump-doubters-remain/\">aimed at unifying a party</a> torn over Trump&#8217;s rise to the cusp of the Republican presidential nomination. The speaker appeared closer to offering a full-throated endorsement.</p>\n<p>Trump and Ryan issued a statement describing their meeting as a &#8220;very positive step toward unification&#8221; that recognized &#8220;many important areas of common ground&#8221; as well as areas where they disagree. <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/house-speaker-paul-ryan-refuses-to-back-donald-trump/\">Ryan stunned Republicans by withholding his endorsement </a>a week ago when it became clear Trump was on a firm path to the nomination.</p>\n<p>The much-anticipated meeting unfolded Thursday morning as more Republicans have begun urging the party to put the extraordinary discord behind. The statement by the two suggested both are invested in tamping down the Republican infighting as they try to pull the GOP together for the fight against Hillary Clinton and Democrats in the fall.</p>\n<p>Ryan told a news conference they are &#8220;planting the seeds&#8221; to accomplish that.</p>\n<p>Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York, a Trump supporter, said it will help both the candidate and the speaker if they can work through their differences.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s do or die, any endorsement in particular,&#8221; he said outside the building. But &#8220;Donald Trump&#8217;s candidacy is strengthened with an endorsement from the most powerful person, top-ranking Republican in the country. It helps.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Related reading: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/donald-trump-the-worst-is-yet-to-come/\">Donald Trump: The worst is yet to come</a></strong></p>\n<p>On the eve of the meetings, Trump eased his defiant tone of recent days. Asked on Fox News who leads the party in his view, he said Ryan. &#8220;I would say Paul for the time being and maybe for a long time,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We can always have differences,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you agree on 70 per cent, that&#8217;s always a lot.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The two men represent vastly different visions for the Republican Party, and whether they can come together may foretell whether the GOP will heal itself after a bruising primary season or face irrevocable rupture.</p>\n<p>Trump, for years a registered Democrat, has offended women, Hispanics, and others while violating establishment party orthodoxy on numerous issues Ryan holds dear, from trade to wages to religious freedom. Ryan, a policy-focused conservative, insists the GOP must be a party of ideas, and has championed an agenda that has drawn Trump&#8217;s scorn by pushing cuts in Medicare and other government programs.</p>\n<p>Indeed, a broader swath of Republican voters appears to be moving behind Trump, despite big-name holdouts such as Ryan, both former president Bushes and the party&#8217;s 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney. Romney went after Trump on Wednesday over his refusal thus far to release his taxes, calling it &#8220;disqualifying&#8221; and asserting that the only explanation must be &#8220;a bombshell of unusual size.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Still, almost two in three Republican-leaning voters now view Trump favourably, compared with 31 per cent who view him unfavourably, according to a national Gallup Poll taken last week. The numbers represent a near total reversal from Gallup&#8217;s survey in early March.</p>\n<p><strong>Related reading: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/seven-ways-donald-trump-might-become-president/\">Seven ways Donald Trump might become president</a></strong></p>\n<p>And on Capitol Hill, where Ryan has managed to remain popular since taking over as speaker in the fall, some Republicans made clear that they would like to see him come around to supporting Trump sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, an ally of GOP leadership, said Thursday his biggest worry about Trump is that he is &#8220;&#8217;unpredictable.&#8221; Yet Trump is also a &#8220;change agent,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what people want right now, so in that sense he&#8217;s very well-positioned for a general election.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It seems to me they have every incentive to find common ground,&#8221; he said of Trump and Ryan, &#8220;because to be successful they both in a sense need one another.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Three meetings were on tap for Trump: the one with Ryan and the party chairman, then with Ryan joined by other senior House GOP leaders and one with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Senate Republicans.</p>\n<p>McConnell was quick to embrace the mogul after he clinched the nomination and said this week that Trump is looking like he&#8217;ll be &#8220;very competitive&#8221; in November.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-pledge-to-work-together/\">Donald Trump and Paul Ryan pledge to work together</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-pledge-to-work-together/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Most government-sponsored Syrian refugees in permanent homes: McCallum</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/most-government-sponsored-syrian-refugees-in-permanent-homes-mccallum/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/most-government-sponsored-syrian-refugees-in-permanent-homes-mccallum/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:49:47 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[John McCallum]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Syrian refugee crisis]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Syrian refugees]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=872985</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Canada&#8217;s Immigration Minister John McCallum speaks during a news conference in Ottawa, Canada November 24, 2015.

(Sean Kilpatrick/CP)</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;This is not about advancing a skewed partisan interest,&#8221; Maryam Monsef said yesterday as she announced a new parliamentary committee to discuss electoral reform. A majority of the members on the committee are Liberals, but you&#8217;re not being helpful when you point that out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to move beyond a system that pits neighbour against neighbour,&#8221; said Monsef, the youngest minister in Justin Trudeau&#8217;s cabinet but, I suspect, nowhere close to\u00a0the most naive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In a multi-party democracy like Canada,&#8221; she said, &#8220;first past the post&#8221;\u2014the system that gives each riding to the candidate with the largest number of votes, regardless of whether that candidate came close to winning a majority of local votes\u2014&#8221;distorts the will of the electorate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was first-past-the-post that produced\u2014well, most of Canada&#8217;s majority governments. Let&#8217;s put it that way, in an\u00a0effort to avoid pitting\u00a0neighbour against neighbour. If I pointed out that the current government, led by Justin Trudeau, controls 54 per cent of the seats in the Commons based on a little more than 39 per cent of the popular vote, it might pit you against your neighbour. If I point out that the previous government, led by Stephen Harper, controlled almost the same fraction of the seats in the Commons based on almost the same fraction of the popular vote, your neighbour might rise up and smite you. And today just isn&#8217;t about smiting, all right? It just isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our government believes all Canadians&#8217; voices should be heard,&#8221; Monsef said. And: &#8220;We want to ensure that Canadians across our diverse society are involved in this historic change.&#8221; Does that include some Canadians in particular? It sure does. &#8220;This includes Canadians that often go unheard such as women, young people, seniors, Indigenous persons, new Canadians, those of modest means, those Canadians living in rural and remote communities.&#8221; Excellent. But beyond those groups, which together actually add up to\u00a0a large majority of Canadians, is this process also about the rest?</p>\n<p>It sure is. &#8220;We\u2019ll be looking for opportunities to inspire all Canadians to vote and to be active participants,&#8221; Monsef said.</p>\n<p>So. All Voices. Across our diverse society. Because the current system distorts the will of the electorate. To avoid pitting neighbour against neighbour. Because skewed partisan interests are not what this is about advancing.

One question was on referendums. &#8220;The referendum question is much like putting a cart before the horse,&#8221; Monsef said. &#8220;Right now our priority is hearing from a broad range of Canadians from across the country.\u00a0I\u2019m particularly interested in hearing from those Canadians who don\u2019t normally engage in the democratic process and don\u2019t normally vote.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This was\u00a0all Kabuki theatre. The party composition of the committee matters because the main parties have different ideas about how, or even whether, reform should happen. Justin Trudeau knows this. He even <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-apologizes-electoral-reform-1.3568632\" target=\"_blank\">apologized to the Commons last week</a> for suggesting his opponents&#8217; views have slowed down his government&#8217;s consultations.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related from <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em>:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/do-the-liberals-have-a-mandate-for-electoral-reform/\">Do the Liberals have a mandate for electoral reform?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Most Liberals like a preferential-ballot system, in which you rank your choices, because many voters who prefer\u00a0a specific party to the Liberals&#8217; left or right will list the Liberals as second choice. This would tend to encourage Liberal majorities built, in large measure, from shrugs and why-nots.</p>\n<p>The NDP, with a disproportionate number of support\u00a0from voters who would shrug and why-not the Liberals on their undercard, prefers a proportional system in which first choices would count and endure.</p>\n<p>The Conservatives, who won three elections on splits, the way elections are usually won in this country, don&#8217;t like any of this talk. They want the people to decide, in a referendum, essentially rediscovering the Reform Party&#8217;s taste for popular democracy after Stephen Harper low-bridged that element of his Conservative party&#8217;s heritage for a decade.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-quagmire-of-electoral-reform-and-the-hunt-for-political-legitimacy/\">The quagmire of electoral reform and the hunt for legitimacy</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, here&#8217;s the thing. <em>Each</em> of these positions <em>is legitimate</em>, in the sense that each position\u00a0protects some values while giving others short shrift. A ranked ballot would be simple but it&#8217;s bad at ensuring diverse opinions get represented in the House. (As long as you represent the big non-diverse opinion a ranked ballot tends to lift up, you <em>like</em> this result, and you view it as &#8220;not advancing a skewed partisan interest.&#8221;) Proportional representation lets a hundred flowers bloom but it can be hard to explain to bored or distracted voters (who are, incidentally, <em>allowed</em>, in a democracy, to be bored or distracted; and in any case are hard to excite or focus). Referendums do give each voter a voice, although that doesn&#8217;t make them perfect: they&#8217;re best only for simple choices, and by that same token they can exaggerate, and worsen, regional differences.</p>\n<p>It would be really excellent if Canada&#8217;s minister of democratic reform would demonstrate an understanding of these disputes. I promise you this one understands them very well. I&#8217;m not even <em>entirely</em> sure she has cooked this process to produce the Liberals&#8217; favourite outcome, although one notes that everything\u00a0in this process makes the Liberals&#8217; favourite outcome\u00a0the likeliest.</p>\n<p>But the minister&#8217;s determined insistence that there is (on one hand) a commonly accepted common interest and (on the other hand) no particular need to put that notion to a population-wide vote, produces a paradox: She seems so nice. And she is acting the way someone would act if she were trying to pull a fast one.</p>\n<p>Will she act on the committee&#8217;s recommendations or will the cabinet\u00a0do what it wants? &#8220;The feedback we receive from the committee will be invaluable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yes, but once the committee reports, who\u00a0will have the final say? &#8220;The final decision will be a decision made by 338 MPs in the House of Commons, and then Senate will have an opportunity to review the legislation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She wants to get this right. She said so three times. &#8220;We want to get this right.&#8221; Apparently we&#8217;ll have to trust her.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/on-electoral-reform-maryam-monsef-wants-to-get-this-right/\">On electoral reform, Maryam Monsef wants to &#8216;get this right&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/on-electoral-reform-maryam-monsef-wants-to-get-this-right/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>10</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A second chance for Ottawa to make things right with Alberta</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-second-chance-for-ottawa-to-make-things-right-with-alberta/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-second-chance-for-ottawa-to-make-things-right-with-alberta/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:01:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Evan Solomon]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Fort McMurray]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Fort McMurray fire]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=872397</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Dealing with disaster is a tricky political game</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-second-chance-for-ottawa-to-make-things-right-with-alberta/\">A second chance for Ottawa to make things right with Alberta</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_872707\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MAC21_SOLOMON_POST-1.jpg\" alt=\"Fort McMurray, Alberta, fire chief Darby Allen speaks to members of the media at a fire station in Fort McMurray, Monday, May 9, 2016.

Rachel La Corte/AP</p></div>\n<p>There\u2019s no place for politics at the height of an emergency. No place for debates about ideology when the Beast is raging and people are fleeing for their lives. The Beast\u2014as locals call the fire that slashed through Fort McMurray and still rages\u2014 doesn\u2019t distinguish between left and right, rich or poor. The Beast consumes everything, words and politics. For now. Soon, however, when the long rebuilding process begins, it will do the very opposite. The Beast of Fort McMurray will define politics in the West for a generation. It\u2019s up to Justin Trudeau to decide in what way.</p>\n<p>For the moment, Trudeau has smartly stayed in the background. For a Prime Minister who is developing a reputation for showing up at the opening of an envelope, Trudeau has displayed restraint, compassion and an adroit ability to avoid making the disaster about him. No comments about the impact of climate change. That debate will come, but not right now. No immediate visit to the Edmonton evacuation centre, where Trudeau might have recreated the now-famous scene when he met the Syrian refugees at the Toronto airport. Would that have looked empathetic or gallingly self-promoting? The line is too fine to walk, as every leader knows.</p>\n<p>Instead, Trudeau waited almost two weeks to visit the city, in the meantime letting the fire illuminate the resilience, generosity and optimism of the people of Fort McMurray, of Alberta and of Canada. Is there a more tireless and competent man than fire chief Darby Allen, who led the emergency team that saved 85 per cent of Fort McMurray? What about the recently laid-off oil workers, driving their pickup trucks up and down Highway 63 delivering fuel, groceries and medicine to evacuating families? They deserve the spotlight, as do Canadians who donated record-breaking amounts to the Red Cross.</p>\n<p>While Premier Rachel Notley has shown immense leadership skills\u2014sure-handed and confident-\u2014we must also mention Wildrose Leader Brian Jean, who recently lost his 24-year-old son to a brain hemhorrage related to lymphoma. His house and all the memories it held burned down. Since then he\u2019s been living a tent, helping his neighbours, not wanting to take up space at an evacuation centre. A former MP, Jean is a tough political partisan, but if you ever needed a reason to ditch your cynicism about the kind of people who embody the spirit of public service, Jean is it. I spoke to him as he choked back tears, not over his own loss\u2014he faced that with stoicism\u2014but over the countless acts of generosity he\u2019d witnessed. The destruction may have laid bare a city, but it revealed a people at their very best.</p>\n<p>Still, Trudeau is keenly aware how quickly goodwill can turn to a political ash. George W. Bush\u2019s inept response to hurricane Katrina damaged his political credibility and handed the next election to the Democrats. \u201cBrownie, you\u2019re doing a heck of a job,\u201d Bush blurted out in his frat-boy style, congratulating his crony Michael Brown on his leadership of FEMA, the agency tasked with handling the crisis. A week later \u201cBrownie\u201d was fired. Americans, especially African-Americans, never forgot Bush\u2019s indifference.</p>\n<p>The \ufb01re in Fort McMurray is a similar pivotal moment. Federal support for the city will be a proxy for how Ottawa supports Alberta and the oil sands in general. Trudeau has offered to match Red Cross donations and sent in military support, but that\u2019s just a start. After promising billions of dollars to fight climate change, readying a bailout for Bombardier, and, this week, pledging $785 million for a global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, Trudeau must come forward with a major package for Fort McMurray.</p>\n<p>For some this means nothing less than a pipeline going east or west, a signal that Fort McMurray has a genuine economic future and a recovery plan. Cue the debate over climate change. But if Trudeau dithers, he risks unleashing the seething Western anger that has been pooling in the tailing ponds since his father\u2019s National Energy Program. In fact, since Confederation itself.</p>\n<p>\u201cThose discourses\u2014the West versus the rest\u2014will not disappear, they have become part of Western identity, but they do not have to dominate Westerners\u2019 disparate identities,\u201d Mary Janigan told me when I asked her if the fire could be a political turning point for the West. She is the author of the brilliant book <em>Let the Eastern Bastards Freeze in the Dark</em>, which chronicles the history of Western alienation. According to Janigan, Trudeau\u2019s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, loved her book and he told her Trudeau did as well, which may explain how carefully and attentively Trudeau has treated Alberta. \u201cI do think that the nuanced federal response of practical sympathy and prompt help can do much to heal a breach that is almost as old as Confederation,\u201d Janigan says optimistically. \u201cThere are no miracles, but attitudes can evolve.\u201d</p>\n<p>With an NDP government in Alberta and a Liberal government in Ottawa, the horror of this fire offers an opportunity for either a genuine political realignment to take deep root or for old resentments and fractures to deepen. The real Beast will not end up being the fire itself, but how the federal government handles the rebuilding of Fort McMurray.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-second-chance-for-ottawa-to-make-things-right-with-alberta/\">A second chance for Ottawa to make things right with Alberta</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-second-chance-for-ottawa-to-make-things-right-with-alberta/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A nation responds to the Fort McMurray fire</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-nation-responds-to-the-fort-mcmurray-fire/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-nation-responds-to-the-fort-mcmurray-fire/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:00:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[John Geddes]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Fort McMurray]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Fort McMurray fire]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=872391</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>From lemonade stands to charity concerts, Canadians were moved to break their own record of generosity </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-nation-responds-to-the-fort-mcmurray-fire/\">A nation responds to the Fort McMurray fire</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_872471\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-872471\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MAC21_NATION_RESPONDS_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Residents of Fort McMurray, Alberta, sort through donated items brought to a donation centre in Wandering River after evacuating Fort McMurray due to raging wildfires on May 6, 2016.

(Topher Seguin/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>By now pretty much all of Canada knows about the bond between Fort McMurray, Alta., and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It was forged by necessity, over decades of migration west to the oil sands country for good pay. But that path created by the search for jobs evolved into a conduit for friendship, family and culture, too. Chris Andrews, guitarist and lead singer of the accordion-driven Newfoundland band Shanneyganock, has played Fort Mac many times over more than two decades of touring. \u201cYears ago, it had a reputation as a rough, hard place,\u201d he says. \u201cBut lately it\u2019s more about lots of families, schools and ballparks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aware of how well Andrews knew that far-away, familiar city, CBC Radio in St. John\u2019s interviewed him early last week as the Fort McMurray evacuation began dominating the news. Kirk Youden, a town councillor in Conception Bay South, known locally as CBS, about 20 km southwest of the Newfoundland capital, was listening. When he heard the interviewer mention the possibility of benefit concerts, Youden emailed his fellow councillors, proposing one for their spanking new CBS arena. All quickly agreed, and Shanneyganock was soon on board to headline a show slated for May 15, all proceeds to the Canadian Red Cross\u2019s Fort McMurray fund. Similar fundraising concerts and kitchen parties are being held up and down the East Coast, where it seems everybody knew somebody in the path of the fire. Andrews has a friend whose house burned down, while Youden has two longtime buddies working in the oil sands.</p>\n<p>If Fort Mac\u2019s need struck a special chord in Atlantic Canada, variations on the theme played across the country. Somebody caught a news report and was moved to make some calls, send some emails, launch a Facebook page, get something going. The cumulative result is an outpouring that might just be unprecedented. As of May 10, the Canadian Red Cross had received $60 million in donations for Fort McMurray, and the federal government\u2019s pledges to match all individual donations. That dwarfs the $43.3 million the Red Cross raised in 2013 after the Alberta floods, the organization\u2019s largest domestic Canadian appeal before this week.</p>\n<p>If the images of Fort Mac residents fleeing in convoys down a highway flanked by flame was, as Andrews put it, \u201cgut-wrenching,\u201d the stories of children taking up their plight were heartwarming. In the suburbs of Toronto, kids who set up lemonade stands to raise money for Fort McMurray raked in more than $400 in one case, better than $2,500 in another.

(Topher Seguin/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>If the idea sounds a little silly, well, thoughtful Northlea kids get that. Josh Girvan, 13, says younger pupils, like his nine-year-old little brother, are just excited about the pyjamas part, but he adds, \u201cI think the older kids are going to understand how serious it is and keep up the spirit by donating.\u201d His Grade 7 teacher, Allana Ossher, thought up the idea, partly because she spent six years of her childhood in Calgary, and is using the fire in geography lessons. Josh\u2019s classmate, Clara Leslie, also 13, says Fort McMurray has been a frequent topic of conversation with her parents, too. \u201cI\u2019m learning about a place I had never heard of before,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>In fact, many Canadians are learning to consider Fort Mac in a way they hadn\u2019t before. News reports focusing on hard-hit evacuees humanized a city previously associated, for many outsiders, with images like photographer Edward Burtynsky\u2019s aerial photos of epic-scale oil sands mining, which tend to suggest a ruined boreal landscape. \u201cIf I flew over it, I\u2019d probably be appalled,\u201d says JJ Hilsinger, owner of the Water Tower Inn in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. That didn\u2019t stop Hilsinger, though, from spearheading a drive to get Soo businesses to create a pool of at least $25,000, out of which they will match any individual donations from local residents to the Red Cross\u2019s fire fund. His environmental misgivings? \u201cIt didn\u2019t come into the equation,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just saw that there were a whole lot of people in dire need, and going through a fearful point in life.\u201d</p>\n<p>The oil sands\u2019 impact on the landscape and implications for climate change have long been political flashpoints. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared it would be wrong \u201cto make a political argument out of one particular disaster.\u201d Indeed, Trudeau took care not to be seen to seek any sort of political edge out of the situation, putting off a visit in order not to get in the way of the work of first responders. So the Prime Minister\u2014whose in-person welcoming of Syrian refugees at Toronto\u2019s airport made international news last year\u2014was not present in Edmonton to meet evacuees. On May 10, however, Trudeau announced in the House, \u201cI will be going personally to Fort McMurray on Friday to offer up some support from all Canadians.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Related: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/fort-mcmurray-faq/\" target=\"_blank\">Maclean&#8217;s answers all your questions about the Fort McMurray fire</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>For the most part, the stolid voice of the federal response to the disaster belonged to Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who also happens to be, as a veteran Saskatchewan MP, the senior Prairie Liberal. Goodale repeatedly touted Ottawa\u2019s contributions, while carefully deferring to Notley\u2019s leadership. Goodale and Trudeau took every opportunity to urge Canadians to give to the Red Cross, repeating his government\u2019s pledge to match donations, while shipping thousands of cots, blankets, generators and other basic supplies to Alberta\u2019s evacuation shelters.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/watch-from-nasa-satellites-as-the-fort-mcmurray-fire-spreads/\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Space Agency helped track the blaze</a> with images from several satellites, including RADARSAT-2. The Canadian Forces contributed four Griffon helicopters and one Hercules transport plane, helping airlift civilians, deliver medical supplies and monitor the fire zone. (The military made a point of touting the first humanitarian mission for one of its newly acquired Chinook helicopters.) Among contributions from provinces, Quebec sent four water bombers, Ontario sent three 21-person firefighting teams, and Manitoba sent an urban search and rescue unit.</p>\n<p>Still, many details of the federal response remain hazy. \u201cI know there will be lots of discussions in the coming days and weeks about what we need to do to <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/we-can-build-it-better-than-it-was-brian-jean-on-the-fort-mcmurray-fire/\" target=\"_blank\">rebuild Fort McMurray</a>, but I can ensure and reassure Alberta that all Canadians will be there,\u201d Trudeau said.</p>\n<p>Less emotionally gripping than the plight of individuals forced from their homes is the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/five-things-we-learned-from-notleys-meeting-with-oil-sands-execs/\" target=\"_blank\">shutdown of oil sands production</a>. Federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr was reportedly in discussions with oil companies about what was needed to get the massive operations up and running again.</p>\n<p>For at least the next two weeks, however, <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/we-can-build-it-better-than-it-was-brian-jean-on-the-fort-mcmurray-fire/\" target=\"_blank\">human stories</a> will overshadow the economic toll. Among the most touching was Syrian refugee Rita Khanchet\u2019s response when she saw in Fort McMurray\u2019s plight something of the same trauma she had gone through in her own war-ravaged country. Khanchet, who has been in Calgary with her husband and young son for just five months, used a Facebook post to rally other Syrian refugees to donate $5 each and pooled that money to buy hygiene items for Fort Mac evacuees.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_872475\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-872475\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MAC21_NATION_RESPONDS_POST03.jpg\" alt=\"Salem Kallas loads totes into his van (donated to his family by the Syrian Refugee Support Group) at the Rundle Superstore in Calgary, Alta., on Thursday, May 5, 2016.

(Lyle Aspinall/Postmedia Network)</p></div>\n<p>Among many business efforts to help out, Labatt drew notice by temporarily canning water instead of beer in London, Ont., and delivering thousands of the aluminum cans\u2014lighter, less prone to breaking, and thus better for disaster-response situations than bottled water\u2014to Edmonton. Companies with big presence in Fort McMurray faced special challenges. The response of Sobeys Inc., which has three supermarkets stores and two liquor stores in Fort Mac, is a saga in its own right. The grocery chain had some 500 evacuated employees to track. A lone manager, still in the city as it emptied out, rushed back to a store at the last minute to distribute water, batteries, power bars and other supplies to firefighters. By 8 a.m. on May 4, Sobeys had decided to donate $100,000 in goods and another $100,000 to match customer cash donations, and signs were up in its stores across the country asking shoppers to give to the Red Cross.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Red Cross was so ubiquitous in the response that it could almost be overlooked. Yet behind its institutional aura there are, of course, individuals, sometimes providing not just the crucial practical help, but also moments of precious normalcy to those plunged into crisis. Jenn McManus, the Canadian Red Cross\u2019s vice-president of operations for Alberta, spent much of last week at the Expo Centre at Northlands in Edmonton, which has been transformed into a 1,300-bed shelter. On Mother\u2019s Day, flowers suddenly appeared there by the bucket. Kids and fathers swarmed, taking bouquets from staff and volunteers, to present to their partners. McManus\u2019s voice dissolves into tears when she talks about it. \u201cYou know, my brain and my heart probably haven\u2019t caught up with each other yet,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is going to be a long haul, so let\u2019s celebrate the small things.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the shelters, McManus says evacuees hunger for information about what they left behind. They hunch over their phones at charging stations, trading info with friends and family, or bunch themselves around televisions blaring news. But McManus and her staff and volunteers encourage them to take a break from it all once in a while; it\u2019s just too emotionally exhausting otherwise. \u201cFamilies and individuals are coming off of that fight-or-flight adrenalin rush that happened last week with the evacuation,\u201d she says. \u201cNow the reality and impact and the scope of this is starting to settle in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even within the crowded centres, McManus has seen small moments of kindness and dignity for people who have precious little control over anything right now. There are bowls of fruit where evacuees can help themselves, and kiosks offering juice boxes, those water cans from Labatt, and pop. Tim Hortons showed up with trucks of coffee and tea.</p>\n<p>As of Monday, the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-the-red-cross-is-helping-the-victims-of-fort-mcmurray/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Cross</a> had 600 staff members and trained volunteers responding to the crisis. The organization\u2019s offices in Medicine Hat, Lethbridge, Calgary, Red Deer, Edmonton and Grande Prairie are helping evacuees who have landed in those cities, while other staff and volunteers are on the ground assisting at emergency shelters in Lac La Biche, Edmonton and Calgary. \u201cSometimes, you have to find the silver lining,\u201d says McManus. \u201cHands down, across Alberta, the generosity and openness to coordinate and put resources on the table has been truly remarkable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Next to the Red Cross, the Salvation Army is perhaps the next most reassuring presence around the emergency. Major Brian Beveridge, a Salvation Army minister in Grande Prairie, has served hot meals to first responders out of a mobile canteen during Alberta emergencies from the 2011 forest fire that destroyed much of Slave Lake, to the 2013 flood that inundated High River. Rolling into Fort Mac last Friday morning, Beveridge and other Salvation Army volunteers began working around the clock to serve about 2,000 freshly cooked meals a day\u2014roast beef, chicken, lasagna\u2014to weary police and firefighters. \u201cThey like to have a bite to eat, that\u2019s right,\u201d Beveridge, 65, said, speaking to Maclean\u2019s by cellphone from the side of the highway south of Fort McMurray, on his way out for a rest after four gruelling, satisfying days.</p>\n<p>Few Canadians have the chance to help as directly as Beveridge or McManus. But thousands are reaching out. Back on the East Coast, Kim Doyle, a professional event organizer in Charlottetown, says \u201cnobody is taking a cut\u201d at the fundraising bash planned for this Friday at P.E.I. Brewing Company. Musicians and servers are working for free. All the proceeds go to help the fire\u2019s victims. \u201cNot the profits, the sales,\u201d Doyle stresses. \u201cIf you buy a beer for $5, $5 goes to the Red Cross.\u201d The party is scheduled to stretch from six in the evening until two the next morning. The feeling of a vast country bound more tightly together will last even longer.</p>\n<p><em>With files from\u00a0Shannon Proudfoot\u00a0and Emily Senger</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-nation-responds-to-the-fort-mcmurray-fire/\">A nation responds to the Fort McMurray fire</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-nation-responds-to-the-fort-mcmurray-fire/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>11 stories in Canada we&#8217;re watching</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/11-stories-in-canada-were-watching-10/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/11-stories-in-canada-were-watching-10/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 11:37:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Stories We're Watching]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=872791</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>In the news today: Fort McMurray, Attawapiskat, and Paul Martin </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/11-stories-in-canada-were-watching-10/\">11 stories in Canada we&#8217;re watching</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id='Politics' class='widgets_on_page'>\r\n    <ul><li id=\"text-16\" class=\"widget widget_text\">\t\t\t<div class=\"textwidget\"><style>.a-z{position:relative;margin:0 0 1em;padding:0;max-width:820px;font-family:sans-serif}.a-z-img{max-width:100%}</style><div class=\"a-z\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/\" title=\"Politics\">\r\n<img src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Politics_banner.jpg\" alt=\"Politics\" class=\"a-z-img\" /></a><br />\r\n</div>\n\t\t</li></ul>\r\n  </div><!-- widgets_on_page --><br />\n<strong>Eleven\u00a0stories in the news today:</strong></p>\n<h3>PROGRESS MADE IN RESTORING FORT MCMURRAY UTILITIES</h3>\n<p>Crews are working 24/7 to restore power and natural gas to the fire-ravaged city of Fort McMurray, but the chief operating officer of the utility that Serves the area says it&#8217;s impossible to say how soon residents will be able to go home. Atco COO Siegfried Kiefer says it not yet safe enough to turn the power back on and they need to check gas lines before resuming the supply of natural gas.</p>\n<h3>OTTAWA PUTS ALL HANDS ON DECK FOR FORT MCMURRAY</h3>\n<p>The federal government is putting all hands on deck with a special cabinet committee to co-ordinate Fort McMurray aid and reconstruction efforts in advance of the prime minister&#8217;s visit on Friday. Nine different ministries are involved in the federal ad hoc committee, which will be chaired by Calgary MP Kent Hehr, who serves as veterans affairs minister and associate minister of defence.</p>\n<h3>BIG BANKS CUT GROWTH FORECASTS AFTER WILDFIRE</h3>\n<p>The effects of the enormous Alberta wildfire on the ever-crucial oil sector have prompted forecasters to trim their 2016 economic growth predictions for the entire country. At this early stage, however, economists stressed that their predictions remain in flux as officials and companies gain a better understanding of the situation.</p>\n<h3>STRIP CLUB OFFERS LAP DANCES FOR FIRE EVACUEES</h3>\n<p>Fire evacuees from Fort McMurray have been offered meals, clothing, places to stay and now an unusual gift \u2014\u00a0a free lap dance. An Edmonton strip club is waiving its $9 entry fee and offering one $30 lap dance to any customers from the evacuated city in northern Alberta.</p>\n<h3>NEW MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS FOR ATTAWAPISKAT</h3>\n<p>Health Canada says it will fund two additional mental health workers and a case manager for youth in Attawapiskat to assist with the northern Ontario reserve&#8217;s suicide crisis. But there is no indication as to when the workers will be on the ground in the troubled community and what level of training will be required. Health Minister Jane Philpott says an update will be provided once more information is available.</p>\n<h3>TWO-TIER PARDON FEES UNDER CONSIDERATION</h3>\n<p>People convicted of minor offences would pay less than those guilty of serious crimes when applying for a pardon under a scenario being studied by the federal parole board. The Parole Board of Canada quietly launched an online consultation this week asking people what they think of the $631 application charge for a criminal pardon \u2014\u00a0a fee that quadrupled under the previous Conservative government.</p>\n<h3>PAUL MARTIN PORTRAIT UNVEILED IN PARLIAMENT</h3>\n<p>For years, Paul Martin was a fixture in the halls of Parliament, as finance minister in Jean Chretien&#8217;s Liberal government and then as prime minister himself. Now, a portrait of Martin has been unveiled that will _ just as Martin did in real life _ displace his former boss. The new painting means Chretien&#8217;s picture will be bumped down the corridor leading to the House of Commons, because the PMs are displayed in order of their time in office.</p>\n<h3>ALSO IN THE

income among 10 Canadian cities it analyzed.</p>\n<p>Vancity Credit Union says a typical Vancouver couple aged 24 to 34, with a combined annual income of about $72,000, would go into debt by $2,745 a year after buying an average priced property and paying essential expenses including property taxes, food, utilities and transportation.</p>\n<p>The housing market in Toronto is the second-most expensive and a millennial couple there had the next lowest level of discretionary income.</p>\n<p>The report says a couple in Toronto would have about $3,400 in discretionary income annually after buying an average priced house.</p>\n<p>Millennial couples in Edmonton have the highest level of annual discretionary income at more than $47,000.</p>\n<p>The report says that when childcare is added, a Vancouver family with one youngster in full-time care faces a debt of more than $17,000 per year.</p>\n<p>Income and household spending costs in the report are based on Statistics Canada data. Housing figures are based on prices for March 2016 from real estate boards across the country.</p>\n<p>Vancity warns that millennials in Vancouver may need to reconsider home ownership as the first and best way to create wealth, adding that a lack of rental housing in the region is also a problem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The status quo isn&#8217;t good enough if we want this generation to be able to put down roots, possibly have a family and still enjoy a basic quality of life in Vancouver,&#8221; says William Azaroff, Vancity&#8217;s vice-president of community investment.</p>\n<p>Yearly costs for an average home purchased in Metro Vancouver in 2016 are $44,354, and the report says that millennials would have to give up the dream of a single-family home in order to ease the budget crunch.</p>\n<p>Buying a townhouse at an average cost leaves about $9,500 annually in discretionary income, and that climbs to about $16,400 if a condominium is purchased, the report says.</p>\n<p>However, Vancouver lacks an adequate supply of townhouses as an option for families who can&#8217;t afford homes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Toronto and Vancouver are particularly difficult cities in which to raise a family and have money left over to nurture and improve well-being,&#8221; the report concludes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In these cities, basic expenses eat up the majority of income. And in Vancouver, this can be directly correlated to skyrocketing prices for stable, appropriate and affordable housing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The study makes a number of recommendations, from tax credits for new housing development to creating thousands more units of rental housing by 2021.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/vancouver-millennials-have-lowest-discretionary-income-after-house-purchase/\">Vancouver millennials hit hard in real estate frenzy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/vancouver-millennials-have-lowest-discretionary-income-after-house-purchase/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Google to ban payday lending ads, calling industry &#8216;harmful&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/society/technology/google-to-ban-payday-lending-ads-calling-industry-harmful/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/society/technology/google-to-ban-payday-lending-ads-calling-industry-harmful/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:26:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Associated Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Google]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Payday Loans]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=872761</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The ban goes into effect July 13</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/technology/google-to-ban-payday-lending-ads-calling-industry-harmful/\">Google to ban payday lending ads, calling industry &#8216;harmful&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK \u2013 Internet giant Google said Wednesday it will ban all ads from payday lenders, calling the industry &#8220;deceptive&#8221; and &#8220;harmful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s decision could have as much or even more impact on curtailing the industry than any move by politicians, as many payday loans start with a desperate person searching online for ways to make ends meet or cover an emergency.</p>\n<p>Effective July 13, Google will no longer allow ads for loans due within 60 days and will also ban ads for loans where the interest rate is 36 per cent or higher. The industry will join Google&#8217;s other banned categories of ads, such as counterfeit goods, weapons, explosives, tobacco products and hate speech.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products,&#8221; said David Graff, Google&#8217;s director of global product policy, in a blog post that announced the policy change.</p>\n<p>The ban would not impact companies offering mortgages, auto loans, student loans, loans for businesses or credit cards, Google said.</p>\n<p>Payday lenders have long been a target of criticism by politicians and consumer advocates, who argue the industry charges extremely high interest rates to customers, who are often the poor. Payday loans are often used to cover an unexpected expense or to make ends meet before the next paycheque. But for many borrowers, short-term loans wind up being difficult to pay off, leading to a cycle of debt that can drag on for months.</p>\n<p>A 2012 study by Pew showed the average payday borrower is in debt for five months, spending $520 in fees and interest to repeatedly borrow $375. The annual per cent rate on a payday loan is 391 per cent, according to Pew.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is nothing fair about triple-digit interest rates being charged on loans to working families,&#8221; said Keith Corbett, executive vice-president with the Center for Responsible Lending, in a statement. Payday loan stores reap billions of dollars in interest and fees on a product designed to force borrowers into repeat loans. Google is to be praised for doing its part to limit use of these abusive loans.&#8220;</p>\n<p>In response to critics, the payday lending industry has long argued it provides a necessary financial service to people in need of emergency funds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These policies are discriminatory and a form of censorship,&#8221; said Amy Cantu, a spokeswoman with the Community Financial Centers Association of America, the trade group representing payday lenders.</p>\n<p>State legislatures have long looked for ways to target payday lenders, but the payday lending industry has often found ways around new regulations. When several states capped the interest rates on payday loans, the industry pivoted into loans tied to auto titles or moved their operations onto Indian reservations.</p>\n<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is considering new regulations to further restrict the payday lending industry. The rules are expected to be released later this year.</p>\n<p>In a way, Google&#8217;s announcement will likely have more of an impact than any new regulation. Google fields about two out of every three Internet search requests in the U.S. and also controls the world&#8217;s largest digital advertising network. Most of Google&#8217;s ads are triggered by the search requests, relying on an automated system to select a marketing pitch mostly likely to be related to what a person is searching for.</p>\n<p>Under this ban, users searching for words like &#8220;loans&#8221; or &#8220;places to get money&#8221; will no longer pull up ads from payday lenders in the advertising section of the search results.</p>\n<p>Payday lending advertising is a small, but lucrative, part of Google&#8217;s ad revenues, which totalled $67 billion last year. Pew calculated in 2014 that ads related to payday loans can bring in $4.91 to $12.77 per click.</p>\n<p>The price that advertisers are willing to pay for marketing pitches delivered by Google usually reflects how much money they stand to make from making a sale. Search terms tied to products with low profit markets might fetch only a few cents while words that indicate a consumer is mulling an expensive purchase command much higher rates.</p>\n<p>But the amount of impact it will have on the overall payday lending industry remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>In the much larger world of radio and TV advertising, payday lenders spent $277 million on radio and TV ads between June 2012 and May 2013, which would remain unaffected. Two-thirds of the revenue and loans generated in the industry is done at brick-and-mortar shops, as opposed to online payday loans, said Alex Horowitz, an expert on the payday lending industry at Pew.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a drop in the bucket, but there&#8217;s a large part of the industry that will remain unaffected,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Google, and its parent company Alphabet, has had a history of corporate activism. The company&#8217;s previous motto was &#8220;don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; which was replaced with &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; last year.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/technology/google-to-ban-payday-lending-ads-calling-industry-harmful/\">Google to ban payday lending ads, calling industry &#8216;harmful&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/society/technology/google-to-ban-payday-lending-ads-calling-industry-harmful/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Health Canada announces mental health workers for Attawapiskat</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/health-canada-announces-mental-health-workers-for-attawapiskat/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/health-canada-announces-mental-health-workers-for-attawapiskat/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:21:19 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kristy Kirkup, The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Attawapiskat]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=872757</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The department has yet to indicate when the workers will be on the ground in the troubled community</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/health-canada-announces-mental-health-workers-for-attawapiskat/\">Health Canada announces mental health workers for Attawapiskat</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OTTAWA \u2013 Health Canada said Wednesday it will fund two additional mental health workers and a case manager for youth in Attawapiskat to assist with the northern Ontario reserve&#8217;s suicide crisis \u2013 a move that comes after the federal government came under fire by the region&#8217;s MP and the community&#8217;s chief.</p>\n<p>The department has yet to indicate when the workers will be on the ground in the troubled community and what level of training will be required.</p>\n<p>Outside the Commons, Health Minister Jane Philpott could only say an update will be provided once more information is available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are working on a long-term plan for responding to the needs of Attawapiskat, as well as other communities that are facing similar concerns,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very pleased to be able to announce that we will make the resources available to make sure that there are long-term solutions and we&#8217;ll work with our partners to make that happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>NDP MP Charlie Angus cancelled a high-profile trip to the United Nations this week to visit the beleaguered reserve instead to highlight the lack of federal support for youth.</p>\n<p>He was baffled by the fact the Liberal government didn&#8217;t seem to know the reserve&#8217;s permanent mental health worker wasn&#8217;t available to residents under 18.</p>\n<p>Angus said he was pleased there will now be additional resources for the community but he remains upset false information was provided about what is available to address a crisis so severe it garnered global attention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What really concerns me is 30 days into a serious suicide crisis, they either didn&#8217;t know what was on the ground or they were making facts up,&#8221; Angus said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Either way, that&#8217;s really not credible behaviour given the severe risk we are facing with young people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After multiple requests from The Canadian Press for information, the department confirmed Wednesday there is a permanent mental health worker in the community from the Weeneebayko Health Authority who focuses on adult services.</p>\n<p>A youth wellness worker and family intervention worker with a provincial children&#8217;s aid agency \u2013 Payukotayno Child and Family Services \u2013 are also in the community.</p>\n<p>The Ontario government announced Monday it will keep an emergency response team on the ground to assist with the crisis.</p>\n<p>Indigenous suicide is grave concern across the country, Angus added, noting it is one of the reasons his party has been pushing the Liberal government on the complete lack of mental health dollars contained within its recent budget.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Attawapiskat, right now, has international news and we are still not fixing the problem on the ground,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What about all the other communities that have been asking for help that don&#8217;t have the mental health workers where young people are at risk and are not getting any treatment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There is serious dysfunction inside Health Canada on its inability or refusal to respond to the serious health and mental issues facing indigenous youth, he added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have to change the operating culture in Health Canada where they are continually denying services to children and families based on some bureaucratic decision to save pennies when lives are at risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In January, The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal found Ottawa discriminated against First Nations youth in its delivery of child welfare services on reserve.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The panel acknowledges the suffering of those First Nations children and families who are or have been denied an equitable opportunity to remain together or to be reunited in a timely manner,&#8221; the ruling said.</p>\n<p>Cindy Blackstock \u2013 a social worker who spent nine years fighting the government on the issue _ said the $71 million that is set to flow this year on child welfare falls far short of what is needed to close gap.</p>\n<p>She pegs that figure at $200 million this year alone.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/health-canada-announces-mental-health-workers-for-attawapiskat/\">Health Canada announces mental health workers for Attawapiskat</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/health-canada-announces-mental-health-workers-for-attawapiskat/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>RIP Peeter Kopvillem, 1954-2016</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/rip-peeter-kopvillem-1954-2016/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/rip-peeter-kopvillem-1954-2016/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:01:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[macleans.ca]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Peeter Kopvillem]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=872721</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Maclean's loses its senior executive editor, a fine musician and fierce defender of his family's native Estonia</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/rip-peeter-kopvillem-1954-2016/\">RIP Peeter Kopvillem, 1954-2016</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_872751\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-872751 size-large\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-1024x681.jpeg\" alt=\"DSC_0278.JPG\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-300x199.jpeg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-768x511.jpeg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-1024x680.jpeg 1024w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-660x439.jpeg 660w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-680x452.jpeg 680w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-360x239.jpeg 360w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-120x80.jpeg 120w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-510x339.jpeg 510w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-270x180.jpeg 270w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-541x360.jpeg 541w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-123x82.jpeg 123w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-273x182.jpeg 273w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG-650x432.jpeg 650w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0278.JPG.jpeg 1504w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Peter Bregg</p></div>\n<p>Amid the grief and dismay that has rocked <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> at the news of our colleague Peeter Kopvillem&#8217;s death at 61<a href=\"#crxn\">*</a> after a long illness, it was gratifying to note that\u00a0<a href=\"http://news.err.ee/v/Culture/a2a0733b-9271-4dff-8673-78a1a94325ef/canadian-estonian-musician-peeter-kopvillem-dies-at-62\" target=\"_blank\">obituaries from Estonia</a> identified him first as a musician.

They tell us stories about their <span class=\"tone negative\">lost</span> country.\u00a0They say that marksmanship builds character, teaches you how to\u00a0focus. But we know there\u2019s more. Someday, we will <span class=\"tone positive\">free</span> the homeland\u00a0from Moscow\u2019s clutches.</p>\n<p>Four decades later. This past weekend we raised a glass or two as\u00a0Estonia and seven other former Communist bloc nations took their\u00a0place in the European Union, along with Malta and Greek Cyprus. It\u2019s\u00a0still a little hard to believe, as is the fact that almost 13 years\u00a0have passed since the implosion of the <span class=\"tone negative\">Evil</span> Empire (how we loved\u00a0that Ronald Reagan phrase). Entering the EU didn\u2019t happen to\u00a0universal acclaim in Estonia: some <span class=\"tone negative\">critics</span> predict <span class=\"tone negative\">trouble</span> for a\u00a0small country of 1.4 million people <span class=\"tone negative\">lost</span> in a behemoth of 450\u00a0million. Fully a third of those who took part in last fall\u2019s\u00a0referendum voted against joining.\u00a0But I can only concur with the\u00a0EU\u2019s statement after that vote: membership in the union <span class=\"quote\">\u201cmarks\u00a0Estonia\u2019s return to its rightful place in Europe, and sets the seal\u00a0on a process of change that has been both <span class=\"tone negative\">difficult</span> and hard-won.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>Still . . . excuse me for going a little Baltic, but I feel\u00a0somewhat bittersweet about it all. Because even as Estonia\u00a0flourishes, our Estonian-Canadian community here in Canada, of which\u00a0I have been an active member all my life, diminishes.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me <span class=\"tone negative\">wrong</span> \u2014 it\u2019s not on death\u2019s door yet. And in part\u00a0it\u2019s a natural evolution for all ethnic groups in this country:\u00a0successive generations of hyphenated Canadians yield fewer and fewer\u00a0people who try to keep their heritage alive. But the numbers are\u00a0telling. The first worldwide Estonian festival, organized in Toronto\u00a0in 1972, attracted 20,000 people. The last one held in this city, in\u00a02000, drew about 4,000. Summer celebrations that once boasted\u00a0attendance in the thousands are now <span class=\"tone positive\">lucky</span> to get 500. In 1973, 60\u00a0kids finished the Toronto Estonian supplementary school. This year,\u00a0there will be just nine graduates. And so on.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s more than statistics. Those who established the institutions\u00a0I\u2019ve known most of my life \u2014 community centres, churches, choirs, a\u00a0thriving credit union, newspapers and more \u2014 came here some five\u00a0decades ago motivated by one burning desire: independence for\u00a0Estonia. Now that it\u2019s been achieved, we\u2019ve <span class=\"tone negative\">lost</span> a large part of our\u00a0raison d\u2019\u00eatre. There are those in the former East bloc who regret\u00a0the passing of Communism. <span class=\"quote\">\u201cLife was better then,\u201d</span> they mutter.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I think the same thing, albeit for different reasons.With the acceleration of events in Europe, much of our attention is\u00a0now focused on the old (new) country. Many of us have personal\u00a0connections there. Visits in the summer are a matter of course. A\u00a0number of Estonian-Canadians, both old and young, have moved there.\u00a0With Estonia a member of the EU, that trend may accelerate.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been a corresponding movement in this direction. The\u00a0teaching staff at our Toronto school now includes younger\u00a0native-born Estonians. More and more performers at our functions, or\u00a0speakers at our ceremonies, are flown in from Estonia. That\u2019s meant\u00a0a <span class=\"tone positive\">certain</span> revitalization. But these are all things that we used to\u00a0do, and do well, as members of a <span class=\"tone positive\">free</span>-standing immigrant community\u00a0that has been a small but vibrant part of the Canadian mosaic. Are\u00a0we now becoming, in essence, nothing more than a provincial adjunct\u00a0of a tiny country 10,000 km away?</p>\n<p>Those who are active in our remaining organizations are wrestling\u00a0with such questions as they try to reorder priorities and change the\u00a0way things have been done for decades (no easy task \u2014 expatriate\u00a0Eastern European communities are generally conservative). But here\u2019s\u00a0an interesting thing: according to the 1971 census, 18,810 people in\u00a0Canada identified themselves as being of Estonian background; in the\u00a02001 census, that number was up to 22,090.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re out there, so how do you convince new arrivals from Estonia\u00a0that what was established here, by displaced persons who constructed\u00a0dams, mined copper, attended university in spite of language\u00a0barriers, <span class=\"tone positive\">built</span> lives, is worth preserving and reinvigorating? And\u00a0how do you persuade lapsed ethnics (what else can you call them?)\u00a0that they can be not only better Canadians but also better world\u00a0citizens thanks to their heritage, knowledge of another language,\u00a0and an intimate understanding of injustice? Because that potent mix\u00a0has an effect. <span class=\"quote\">\u201cStanding up for Estonian independence was right not\u00a0because of my background, but because as a Canadian I felt <span class=\"tone negative\">outrage\u00a0</span>that Estonians did not have rights that were second nature to me,\u201d\u00a0</span>says Peeter Einola, 50, born and raised in Toronto and now\u00a0vice-chairman of the Estonian (Toronto) Credit Union. <span class=\"quote\">\u201cI felt the\u00a0same <span class=\"tone negative\">outrage</span> with respect to apartheid in South Africa and racial\u00a0<span class=\"tone negative\">intolerance</span> in the United States. Being Estonian helped me to\u00a0understand and feel this sense of <span class=\"tone negative\">wrong</span>.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>I now get a sense that, in our rush to embrace the new and focus on\u00a0what\u2019s happening overseas, we\u2019re in the process of forgetting much\u00a0of what we <span class=\"tone positive\">accomplished</span> in Canada. There seems to be a form of\u00a0forgetting going on in Estonia as well. Talk to some people there,\u00a0and it\u2019s as if the <span class=\"tone negative\">bad</span> old days never were. To some degree that\u2019s\u00a0understandable, says Heiki Ahonen, a former dissident and now\u00a0chairman and managing director of Estonia\u2019s Museum of Occupations\u00a0and the Fight for <span class=\"tone positive\">Freedom</span>, which opened on July 1, 2003. It\u2019s\u00a0dedicated to chronicling what Estonia endured during the war and the\u00a0half-century that followed. <span class=\"quote\">\u201cMemories are selective,\u201d</span> Ahonen says.</p>\n<p>Too many people still alive played a part in the old Communist\u00a0regime, and so, he notes, <span class=\"quote\">\u201cforgetting is a way of preserving one\u2019s\u00a0sanity. But we cannot allow the past to be forgotten.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>A museum, in this case dedicated to preserving the <span class=\"tone positive\">good</span>, might not\u00a0be a <span class=\"tone negative\">bad</span> idea for us as well \u2014 before we face the danger of our\u00a0ethnic heritage being reduced to a half-remembered Easter egg design\u00a0or a few hesitant steps of a folk dance. That goes for all Canadians\u00a0whose ancestry lies among the new European Union members from the\u00a0former Communist bloc. According to the last census, we number\u00a0nearly 1.4 million (add those whose ancestral homelands are evolving\u00a0more slowly, such as Ukrainian-Canadians, and the number balloons to\u00a0more than three million). Perhaps one overall museum here, to\u00a0commemorate the Canadian experience, and individual ones overseas,\u00a0to keep alive what a branch of the tribe lived through.</p>\n<p>Because things are already being <span class=\"tone negative\">lost</span>. The spot where I spent my\u00a0summers is mostly empty now, except for the people who still have\u00a0cottages there. Twelve years ago, some friends who I grew up with\u00a0and still live in Montreal tried to breathe new life into the place\u00a0by instituting a family camp for those who have a connection there.</p>\n<p>And so, over the August long weekend, there are again kids who laugh\u00a0and parents who remember. But for the rest of the time? As one\u00a0elderly cottager wistfully told me, <span class=\"quote\">\u201cIt\u2019s as if the birds don\u2019t even\u00a0sing.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>I raised a glass to Estonia and my friends and relatives there over\u00a0this past EU weekend. <span class=\"tone positive\">Good</span> on you, I said. But the toast was also to\u00a0a small community in Canada that has managed to do <span class=\"tone positive\">great</span> things. And\u00a0to a child with a small rifle, walking along a forest path that\u2019s\u00a0long since overgrown.</p>\n<hr width=\"100%\" />\n<p><a name=\"crxn\"></a><strong>CORRECTION, May 12, 2016</strong>: Peeter was 61 years old when he passed away.

(Mark Blinch/CP)</p></div>\n<p>This morning Jian Ghomeshi stood before\u00a0Regional Senior Justice Timothy Lipson, his back to the public gallery, and spoke publicly for the first time since pleading not guilty in early 2015 \u00a0to\u00a0four\u00a0counts of sexual assault\u00a0and\u00a0one of choking to overcome resistance. There was no &#8220;Well, hi there,&#8221; no &#8220;Happy Wednesday,&#8221; no signature lines once employed by the former marquee CBC Radio host to charm his legions of listeners. Ghomeshi\u00a0read\u00a0from a prepared, <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/i-hope-that-i-can-find-forgiveness-what-jian-ghomeshi-said-in-his-apology/\">page-long statement</a>; his\u00a0voice was strong, if absent\u00a0its familiar\u00a0languid\u00a0undertones,\u00a0as\u00a0he\u00a0delivered a carefully crafted apology to Kathryn Borel, the former CBC producer who accused Ghomeshi of coming up behind her, grabbing her and simulating sex\u00a0while both worked at the popular arts and culture show <em>Q</em> in\u00a02008. Ghomeshi&#8217;s\u00a0mea culpa, and\u00a0his signing a <a href=\"http://lawfacts.ca/criminal/peace-bonds\">peace bond</a>, \u00a0a\u00a0resolution negotiated\u00a0by the defence and Crown, resulted in the the remaining sexual assault\u00a0charge against him\u00a0withdrawn and all\u00a0criminal proceedings concluded.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s court appearance, which lasted\u00a0less than 30\u00a0minutes, definitely\u00a0represented\u00a0an ending, one that appeared\u00a0a blessed relief to participants\u00a0on both sides. Ghomeshi&#8217;s counsel, Marie Henein, a woman acutely aware of the power of\u00a0imagery, showed up in\u00a0bright-white jacket, in\u00a0decided contrast to the\u00a0funereal black she favoured\u00a0during trial. Crown prosecutor Michael Callaghan, who was subject to a barrage\u00a0of\u00a0criticism during\u00a0Ghomeshi&#8217;s February\u00a0trial, appeared almost giddy, joking with media before court that he had no plans to scrum given his experience the last time\u00a0he did so (he\u00a0was flashed by a bare-breasted female protester).</p>\n<p>But there was also no question that the morning&#8217;s events also signalled a\u00a0beginning\u2014the stage being set for\u00a0Ghomeshi&#8217;s next chapter, his\u00a0redemption tour of sorts. When last the public heard\u00a0directly\u00a0from Ghomeshi, it was via indignant Facebook posts, the first\u00a0one immediately after\u00a0his firing from CBC. Then\u00a0still beloved\u00a0by his fans as\u00a0a\u00a0progressive, a feminist, a supporter of White Ribbon campaigns, Ghomeshi laid claim\u00a0to a fondness for less traditional sexual practices and painted himself as the victim &#8220;of a campaign of false allegations pursued by a jilted ex girlfriend and a freelance writer&#8221; as well as\u00a0a censorious CBC. He called accusations of non-consensual sexual acts perpetrated by\u00a0him &#8220;a lie&#8221; and &#8220;salacious gossip in a world driven by a hunger for &#8216;scandal.&#8217; &#8221; He denied any problems with his behaviour at the CBC, a statement later contradicted by an <a href=\"http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/_files/cbcrc/documents/press/report-april-2015-en.pdf\">independent third party report</a> by lawyer Janice Rubin. \u00a0&#8220;And so, with no formal allegations,&#8221; Ghomeshi\u00a0wrote, &#8220;no formal complaints, no complaints, not one, to the HR department at the CBC (they told us they\u2019d done a thorough check and were satisfied), and no charges, I have lost my job based on a campaign of vengeance.&#8221;\u00a0Weeks later, after nine women had come forward to say Ghomeshi had sexually assaulted them but before any criminal charges had been\u00a0laid, he took to Facebook again: \u00a0\u201cI intend to meet these allegations directly,&#8221; he said. \u201cI don&#8217;t intend to discuss this matter any further with the media.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Today, Ghomeshi seemed to reflect back on that past self as misguided, even woefully ignorant,\u00a0while presenting\u00a0himself now as an even more enlightened version of the Jian Ghomeshi CBC aficionados\u00a0thought they knew. &#8220;The past 18 months have been an education for\u00a0me,&#8221; he said, noting that he &#8220;spent a great deal of time reflecting on the incident and the difficulties caused Ms. Borel and I have had to come to terms with my own deep regret and embarrassment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This narrative of enlightenment and progress was echoed\u00a0in\u00a0a letter from a\u00a0therapist Ghomeshi had been seeing since Nov. 12, 2014,\u00a0two weeks before charges were brought against him. (The missive, entered as a court exhibit, is dated April 30, 2016, plumb in the middle of negotiations to drop the charge that took place between the defence, Crown and Borel.) The therapist, whose name was redacted, wrote of\u00a061 meetings taking\u00a0place almost weekly &#8220;focused on the social and personal factors related to the specific charges, the consequences of those charges and strategies for managing anxiety.&#8221; Among the topics explored, according to the letter:\u00a0&#8220;dynamics of power and control and the intersections between gender and the social constructions of status and influence,&#8221; as well as\u00a0&#8220;the effects of discourses related to male dominance&#8221; and &#8220;paradigms of intimacy.&#8221; If those were subjects Ghomeshi learned about in his years as a women&#8217;s studies minor\u00a0at York University in the late 1980s, he seems to have been an even better student this time round.\u00a0Ghomeshi is described in the document from the therapist\u00a0as\u00a0&#8220;a highly engaged participant, examining these interpersonal issues with great commitment and focus.&#8221; He&#8217;s given high marks for what should be basic, civilized behaviour: &#8220;He continues to take accountability for his choices and actions, and continues to explore and practice skills that support healthier relationships.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The therapy lingo\u00a0was echoed in Ghomeshi&#8217;s own statement, which avoided any reference to criminal behaviour; instead, he called his\u00a0conduct &#8220;thoughtless&#8221; and &#8220;sexually inappropriate&#8221;: &#8220;I now recognize that I crossed boundaries inappropriately,&#8221; he said. He was\u00a0&#8220;insensitive to [Borel&#8217;s] perspective and how demeaning my conduct was to her,&#8221; he said, and didn&#8217;t understand it would put a younger, junior co-worker in &#8220;an uncomfortable place.&#8221; He said he&#8217;d\u00a0&#8220;reflected deeply and have been working hard to address the attitudes that led me, at the time, to think this was acceptable.&#8221;</p>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\">\n\n        <meta itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"PT2M19S\" />\n        <meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"\" />\n    \n    <div style=\"display: none;\"></div>\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//admin.brightcove.com/js/api/SmartPlayerAPI.js\"></script>\n\n    <object id=\"myExperience4889044601001\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\">\n        <param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" />\n        <param name=\"width\" value=\"640\" />\n        <param name=\"height\" value=\"360\" />\n        <param name=\"playerID\" value=\"781201057001\" />\n        <param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAAAyz2WOE~,aVUQ6mHrguBSuSrVFuMzlGsPf_mMTNMB\" />\n        <param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\" />\n        <param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"onTemplateLoad\" />\n        <param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"onTemplateReady\" />\n        <param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4889044601001\" />\n                <param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&amp;iu=%2F7326%2Frogers.publishing%2Fmacleans.CPGBusiness%2Fvideos&amp;ciu_szs=728x90%2C300x250&amp;impl=s&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;env=vp&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;ad_rule=1&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;cmsid=1464\" />\n                <param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/anne-kingston-on-the-end-of-ghomeshis-legal-fight/\" />\n        <param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\" />\n        <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" />\n    </object>\n\n</div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    brightcove.createExperiences();\n</script>\n\n<p>Henein, too, offered instruction on how the\u00a0court and public should see her client through a more generous lens\u00a0in her &#8220;final thoughts,&#8221; <a href=\"http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/full-statement-marie-henein-speaks-out-about-unrelenting-public-scrutiny-ghomeshi-case-1.2897692\">remarks</a> that echoed her statements in an\u00a0April\u00a0interview with the CBC&#8217;s Peter Mansbridge.\u00a0She told Mansbridge\u00a0of how her client \u201chad his life turned upside down\u00a0and it has been a painful and difficult process\u201d and hinted at the transformative nature of the process Ghomeshi had been through: &#8220;When you come out on the other side of [a criminal trial], it is something that you carry with you always.&#8221; Today she spoke of Ghomeshi&#8217;s legal battle\u00a0as singular in her 25-year career:\u00a0&#8220;The last 18 months are one of the most difficult I have witnessed anyone ever having to withstand. I do not think many of us would have been able to do so. But he was.&#8221; She spoke of a rehabilitated Ghomeshi, even though today&#8217;s proceedings involved no admission\u00a0of guilt or any wrongdoing: as such, she has adroitly led her client\u00a0from criminal charges and public ignominy to the road of redemption without ever having to stop and linger at &#8220;Sorry, yes I did it.&#8221; &#8220;He has taken this time to reflect in a meaningful and sincere way,&#8221; Henein said in court today. &#8220;His apology demonstrates that.&#8221; It&#8217;s time to\u00a0look away from Ghomeshi, Henein instructed, taking a swipe at the reporters behind her: &#8220;While this matter has consumed the attention of so many, there are many equally important matters in this country that the public wants to know about and that I hope we can now turn our attention to.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Outside Old City Hall, as a small group\u00a0of protesters stood on the sidelines (\u201cPeace bonds don\u2019t give survivors peace,\u201d one sign read),\u00a0Kathryn Borel made it clear she wasn&#8217;t about to look away. In a strongly worded <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/read-the-statement-from-ghomeshi-complainant-kathryn-borel/\">statement</a>\u00a0that was unsparing of\u00a0the CBC and its institutional inattention\u00a0to her plight, Borel pointed out that Ghomeshi &#8220;originally denied all charges against him&#8221;\u2014but had now admitted to wrongdoing and apologized. She explained that she had been\u00a0willing\u00a0to forgo trial in return for the defence&#8217;s offer of a public apology: &#8220;It seemed like the clearest path to the truth,&#8221; she says. &#8220;A trial would have maintained his lie, the lie that he was not guilty, and it would have further subjected me to the very same pattern of abuse that I\u2019m currently trying to stop.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s outcome now\u00a0serves as a\u00a0litmus test, interpreted vastly differently depending on who you talk to. Some commentators see it as the\u00a0Crown folding, an admission\u00a0their case was weak. Others see it as\u00a0driven by Ghomeshi&#8217;s team because it avoids the risks of a second trial while offering a\u00a0redemptive apology that&#8217;s not an\u00a0apology at all. Then there are those who see it as a moral victory for Borel.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, for Ghomeshi, this new humble posture are\u00a0the first steps in his public rehabilitation. As for Borel, she&#8217;s pushing that moral standard farther: Ghomeshi hasn&#8217;t taken full responsibility, she said this morning; he &#8220;hasn\u2019t met any of their allegations head on, as he vowed to do in his Facebook post of 2014. He hasn\u2019t taken the stand on any charge. All he has said about his other accusers is that they\u2019re all lying and that he\u2019s not guilty. And remember: that\u2019s what he said about me.&#8221; Apologizing to her isn&#8217;t enough,\u00a0Borel said, noting that more than 20 women have come forward with allegations of against Ghomeshi: &#8220;There will be no resolution until admits to everything that he\u2019s done.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And so the morning\u00a0ended: with the disconnect between the court of law and court of public opinion more pronounced than it was on day one.\u00a0\u00a0And that&#8217;s the gap that the Ghomeshi redemption tour will have to ultimately bridge, or not.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/ghomeshi-end-of-the-trial-and-start-of-a-redemption-tour/\">Ghomeshi: End of the trial\u2014and start of a redemption tour?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/society/ghomeshi-end-of-the-trial-and-start-of-a-redemption-tour/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>26</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Crude price surges to highest level in 2016</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/economy/crude-price-surges-to-highest-level-in-2016/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/economy/crude-price-surges-to-highest-level-in-2016/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 21:28:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Economy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[price of oil]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=872679</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The June contract for benchmark North American oil surged $1.57 to US$46.23 a barrel</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/crude-price-surges-to-highest-level-in-2016/\">Crude price surges to highest level in 2016</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TORONTO \u2014 The price of crude rallied to its highest level so far this year as investors were pleasantly surprised by the latest figures on oil stockpiles in the United States.</p>\n<p>The June contract for benchmark North American oil surged $1.57 to US$46.23 a barrel as the U.S. reported crude stockpiles declined by 3.4 million barrels last week versus an increase predicted by analysts. U.S. oil production also fell and is down six per cent compared with a year ago.</p>\n<p>Some of the drop can be attributed to the curtailment of more than a million barrels a day of production in the Canadian oilsands region due to the wildfire in the Fort McMurray area of Alberta.</p>\n<p>The gain in oil helped lift energy companies on the S&#038;P/TSX composite index, but the Toronto market ended the day little changed, up 13.02 points at 13,788.21. It was a bit of a breather from a more than 200-point gain the previous session.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the oil-sensitive Canadian dollar was solidly ahead, rising 0.39 of a U.S. cent to 77.81 cents US.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in commodities, June gold rose $10.70 to US$1,275.50 a troy ounce while June natural gas was up two cents at US$2.17 per mmBtu. July copper added a penny to US$2.10 a pound.</p>\n<p>In New York, retail stocks weighed heavily on the U.S. markets as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 217.23 points to 17,711.12, nearly erasing its 222 point gain on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The broader S&#038;P 500 composite index declined 19.93 points to 2,064.46 while the Nasdaq composite fell 49.19 points to 4,760.69.</p>\n<p>Department store retailer Macy&#8217;s posted disappointing revenue and slashed its profit forecast as it reported a drop in sales with international tourists shopping less and customers overall spending less. Its shares (NYSE:M) closed down 15.18 per cent or $5.62 at US$31.38.</p>\n<p>Roland Chalupka, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Canada, said investors may be reading declines in retail earnings reports as a gauge of poor consumer appetite.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The overriding concern is that the consumer isn&#8217;t quite as healthy as some may have predicted,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you think about it, there have been job gains in the U.S. quarter after quarter for years now (and) the unemployment rate is very low. &#8230; Those are all good things, but for some reason the U.S. consumer has not pulled out the chequebook like they have in previous cycles.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chalupka said markets are still looking for a solid reason to take another leg up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now, with declining sales revenue in the U.S., with economies generally struggling to accelerate, it&#8217;s very much a mixed picture,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We would expect over the coming months a mildly positive skew to the market but really, we need to see something provide a catalyst for it to go meaningfully higher.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/crude-price-surges-to-highest-level-in-2016/\">Crude price surges to highest level in 2016</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/economy/crude-price-surges-to-highest-level-in-2016/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>NDP leadership race could have big impact on fundraising capacity</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/ndp-leadership-race-could-have-big-impact-on-fundraising-capacity/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/ndp-leadership-race-could-have-big-impact-on-fundraising-capacity/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 21:16:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NDP leadership]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=872651</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The race to replace Tom Mulcair could last up to two years</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/ndp-leadership-race-could-have-big-impact-on-fundraising-capacity/\">NDP leadership race could have big impact on fundraising capacity</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_860091\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC16_NDP_PARTY_POST01-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-860091\"><img src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MAC16_NDP_PARTY_POST01-1.jpg\" alt=\"NDP buttons at the 2016 NDP Federal Convention in Edmonton, Alberta on Sunday, April 10, 2016.

(Photograph by Amber Bracken)</p></div>\n<p>OTTAWA &#8211; Central players in the NDP say the party&#8217;s upcoming leadership race may have a significant impact on its ability to raise cash for its empty coffers.</p>\n<p>A letter from the party&#8217;s president, vice-presidents and treasurer and obtained by The Canadian Press, says the party&#8217;s federal council should consider the competition&#8217;s financial impact, given party campaign debts pegged around $5-million after last year&#8217;s marathon election campaign.</p>\n<p>The concern is that leadership candidates will siphon away donations that would otherwise go to the party.</p>\n<p>Recent figures released by Elections Canada paint a bleak picture of the party&#8217;s fundraising efforts in its first quarter, when it collected just $1.3 million.</p>\n<p>These factors are all likely to be discussed when the council \u2013 the party&#8217;s governing body between conventions \u2013 meets Sunday to consider the rules for the upcoming race.</p>\n<p>The meeting should set a timeline for the campaign, the letter said, adding that the 2003 and 2012 leadership races both lasted eight months.</p>\n<p>The NDP convention in Edmonton last month, which voted for a leadership race, said the campaign could last for up to two years.</p>\n<p>The party is also hearing from provincial wings about the need to ensure the timing of the race does not conflict with other elections.</p>\n<p>The B.C. NDP has already said it wants to ensure the federal leadership race does not distract from its lead up to the May 2017 election, the letter said.</p>\n<p>It adds that Yukon&#8217;s election might come in the fall of 2016, Nova Scotia&#8217;s could happen any time between late 2016 and late 2018 and Ontario&#8217;s provincial election is scheduled for June 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other leadership races also need to be taken into consideration,&#8221; it said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Saskatchewan NDP and the Manitoba NDP are both looking for a new leader. The Conservative party of Canada will elect a leader on May 27, 2017. The Bloc Quebecois will also elect a leader in 2017.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The party has and will continue to consult all provincial sections to avoid conflicts, the note said, adding the parliamentary calendar should also be taken into account, with the next federal election slated for October 2019.</p>\n<p>In an interview Wednesday with CTV, Tom Mulcair said he does not plan to weigh in on the terms of the competition to replace him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Federal council \u2013 about 100 people from across the country representing both regions and different socio-economic interests \u2013 they&#8217;re going to make that decision and I am going to respect that decision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are only three rules set in stone in the NDP&#8217;s constitution on the selection of a new leader :</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0He or she will be elected on a secret ballot</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Every member may cast a ballot</p>\n<p>\u2022 Candidates with the fewest number of votes drop off the ballot for subsequent voting rounds until one person receives more than 50 per cent support.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/ndp-leadership-race-could-have-big-impact-on-fundraising-capacity/\">NDP leadership race could have big impact on fundraising capacity</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/ndp-leadership-race-could-have-big-impact-on-fundraising-capacity/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>",
