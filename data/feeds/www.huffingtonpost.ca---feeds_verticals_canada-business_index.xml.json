It went from over 15 per cent at that time to just over 18 per cent last year.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"vancouver condos\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4314102/thumbs/o-VANCOUVER-CONDOS-570.jpg\" /><br />\n<em><font size=\"2\">Condos tower over Vancouver's False Creek. (Photo: Yun Han Xu/Getty Images)</font></em><br />\n<br />\nBut just because real estate makes up such a strong segment of B.C.'s economy doesn't mean the sector is completely driven by buying and selling.<br />\n<br />\nIn fact, as University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trevortombe/status/730774449461428224\" target=\"_hplink\">noted on Twitter</a>, much of the market leans on a concept known as \"imputed rent\" \u2014 an estimate of how much it would cost to rent out a property inhabited by its owners.<br />\n<br />\nBy living in units they could be renting out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trevortombe/status/704688080775548929\" target=\"_hplink\">owners are essentially paying themselves</a>, he said.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Other provinces</strong><br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, in central Canada, Ontario's GDP grew by 2.5 per cent year over year.<br />\n<br />\nMaclean's reporter Jason Kirby noted that real estate (along with finance) essentially saved the province's economy even as manufacturing contracted.<br />\n<br />\n<center><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Further to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trevortombe\">@trevortombe</a>'s tweet re: real estate dominance <a href=\"https://t.co/9R2RJg6Qxj\">https://t.co/9R2RJg6Qxj</a> it (and finance) saved Ontario... <a href=\"https://t.co/jxpxKdH1nX\">pic.twitter.com/jxpxKdH1nX</a></p>\u2014 Jason Kirby (@jason_kirby) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason_kirby/status/730864937506050048\">May 12, 2016</a></blockquote><br />\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center><br />\n<br />\nAnd Alberta isn't the only province whose economy fell amid a drop in oil prices.<br />\n<br />\nYukon's GDP fell by 3.8 per cent \u2014 only 0.2 percentage points less than Alberta's did. StatsCan blamed the decrease on goods-producing industries falling by 21 per cent. It also noted the shutdown of a mine that produces lead, nickel, zinc and copper.<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, Saskatchewan's GDP dropped by 1.4 per cent. <br />\n<br />\nConstruction there decreased by 19 per cent.

That, of course, is an assumption that has been around for a long time, not to mention one that has been somewhat difficult to counter, especially in Silicon Valley. <br />\n<br />\nIndeed, as <em>Business Insider</em> pointed out in a <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/asshole-ceos-startup-founders-and-success-2014-11\" target=\"_hplink\">2014 article</a> entitled \"Why 'Arrogant Jerks' Become Rich and Successful in Silicon Valley,\" there is a persistent notion that the so-called right \"DNA\" for an entrepreneurial business leader is comprised of characteristics such as \"resilience\" and \"ability to accept risk,\" along with \"arrogance\" and the ability to be \"a huge jerk.\" Inside Silicon Valley, the article notes, people tend to accept CEOs behaving boorishly because \"arrogance runs rampant and investors seem to reward ruthless behavior with piles of cash.\"<br />\n<br />\nBut what if all those billionaire jerks that everyone uses as an example of why it pays to be an ass when launching a company had actually reined in their inner boor when bringing ideas to market? According to \"<a href=\"http://iveybusinessjournal.com/beware-the-a-hole-tax/\" target=\"_hplink\">Beware the A-hole Tax</a>,\" an <em>Ivey Business Journal</em> article based on negotiations research being conducted by Ivey Business School Professor Ann Frost, there is a good chance that many of the world's so-called successful A-holes would be richer today if they had played nice, or at least nicer.<br />\n<br />\nKeep in mind that even visionary company founders need lots of help navigating the road to success. And that help includes everyone from the suppliers who influence product profitability to the financial backers who dictate a start-up's ownership distribution. And it is no secret that these critical partners dislike doing business with jerks -- even visionary jerks.<br />\n<br />\nAs <em>Business Insider </em>noted, when venture capitalists invest in start-ups, they end up spending a lot of time with the management team that they are betting on. And it can be a real pain in the ass working with an ass. VCs also typically add founders of their new portfolio companies to their CEO networks, which tend to function much better when members comfortably bat around ideas instead of aggressively butt heads over egos. For these reasons (and others), some VCs actually have what they call no A-holes policies.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, as <em>Business Insider </em>also pointed out, taking a pass on a visionary idea just because the person behind it acts like God's gift to capitalism is not easy. \"I want not to invest in jerks,\" VC Eileen Burbidge explained, noting life is too short. But she still can't help wondering if avoiding asses is a bad investment philosophy. \"I'd like to think not,\" she said, \"but I'm supposed to back founders for the best ROI, not personality.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe flip side of feeling bad about avoiding doing business with jerks, of course, is feeling bad about agreeing to work with them -- and that's where nice guys and gals have an advantage.<br />\n<br />\n\"Business is all about deal making,\" says Frost, who teaches executives the art of deal making in the <a href=\"http://www.ivey.uwo.ca/executive/our-programs/ivey-negotiations-program/\" target=\"_hplink\">Ivey Negotiations Program</a>. \"And nobody likes to negotiate with an ass, so they make them pay an A-hole tax, often without even realizing it. This isn't a trivial matter. Being a jerk can be seriously costly, especially for an entrepreneur negotiating ownership stakes with early-stage investors. Think about any one of the business world's high-profile billionaires known to have made it despite being a total jerk, and then think about what a difference that an extra one or two per cent ownership in their own companies would make to their net worth.\"<br />\n<br />\nNobody knows exactly how much being an ass costs you in negotiation outcomes. But Frost is working on it. In partnership with University of Regina Professor Chris Street, the Ivey negotiations expert is designing a study to assess how much a person's reputation for being a jerk costs them in deal making. \"We hope to put together some hard data on the A-hole tax in order to help better convince people that character matters in negotiation, just like it matters in the corner office.\"<br />\n<br />\nFrost isn't saying that you don't need to be tough when you negotiate. Her message is a warning about the risk of limiting your ability to strike a favourable deal by coming to negotiations with a reputation that makes people across the table regret working with you before talks start. \"Too many people think negotiations is about beating the other side,\" she says. \"But as we drive home in the Ivey Negotiations Program, the goal is really finding common ground. And nobody wants to share ground with a jerk, so they are inclined to make them pay.\"<br />\n<br />\nNow, if you already have a reputation for being an ass, don't fret. Whether you earned your bad rep or not, you can repair the damage. According to Frost, A-holes generally inflict damage by looking down on people, so anyone trying to strike the best deal possible needs to check their ego at the door. But that does not mean softening legitimate demands. After all, when it comes to seeking mutually beneficial outcomes, conflict itself is not a problem. In fact, conflict over ideas generally leads to superior outcomes. Interpersonal conflict, on the other hand, leads to the A-hole tax.<br />\n<br />\n\"So if you are perceived as an elitist ass,\" Frost says, \"you need to address that issue before talks start, which can be done by simply showing respect for the other side before sitting down to negotiate. Giving the other side respect is free and it leads to mutual respect because it is actually hard for someone else to perceive you as a total jerk if you treat them like an equal.\"<br />\n<br />\n<strong>AUTHOR BIO: </strong><em>Thomas Watson is the editor of Ivey Business Journal published by the Ivey Business School at Western University in London, Ont.</em><br />\n<br />\n<blockquote><strong>Follow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook</strong><br />\n<div class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/huffpostcablogs/\" data-width=\"570\" data-show-faces=\"true\"></div></blockquote> ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1224573/images/s-MEAN-BOSS-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/12/poultry-workers-diapers-oxfam_n_9935904.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Poultry Workers Fear Taking Bathroom Breaks, Wear Diapers Instead: Oxfam]]></title>\n      <author>Daniel Tencer</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/12/poultry-workers-diapers-oxfam_n_9935904.html?utm_hp_ref=canada-business&amp;ir=Canada+Business</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:47:27 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON \u2014 A <a href=\"https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/stories/no-relief-for-poultry-workers/\" target=\"_hplink\">report from international advocacy group Oxfam</a> says poultry workers in the United States labour in a \"climate of fear,'' with some forced to wear diapers on the job.<br />\n<br />\nIt says many workers are afraid to ask for permission to go to the bathroom.

For too long now, many people in rural, remote, and northern communities have either been forced to live with inadequate and spotty online services, or in many cases, no high-speed Internet at all. In fact, Canada's current broadband coverage standards for upload and download speeds fall well behind many industrialized nations.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2016, building a nationwide information superhighway is as important to Canada's future as building the transcontinental railroad was over 130 years ago. Simply put, it's hard to live without. Imagine a small business owner trying to compete in today's global economy without high-speed Internet. Or a patient waiting for crucial medical test results that are delayed because those results are not available online. Or a young person trying to improve their job skills without access to an online course. <br />\n<br />\nBut in fact, too many Canadians do live without it. A <a href=\"http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/PolicyMonitoring/2014/cmr5.htm#s5-3\" target=\"_hplink\">recent report published by the Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission</a> (CRTC) found that only a fraction of people and businesses in rural and remote communities have access to the upload and download speeds that are almost universally available in our urban centres. For example, almost 100 per cent of people in urban areas have access to download speeds of between 16-25 Megabytes per second (Mbps), compared to only 29 per cent of Canadians in rural communities. That's a significant gap and it needs to be closed.<br />\n<br />\nNot only are a large section of our fellow Canadians being cut off from vital services, they are also being prevented from fully participating in Canadian society and contributing the ideas and the innovations that make our country great. Rural Canada makes up 30 per cent of the country's population and produces one-third of our economic output. It is time to get Internet service in rural and northern Canada moving at full speed.<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><br />\n  <span class=\"quote\">But recognizing high-speed broadband as a basic service is only part of the solution.</span><br />\n</blockquote> <br />\n<br />\nThe good news is that this conversation is shifting from a debate over whether broadband access is an essential service to how we can work together as a nation to get everyone connected.<br />\n<br />\nThe head of the CRTC Jean-Pierre Blais recently talked about the importance of developing a coherent national Internet deployment strategy in Canada. As municipal leaders, we entirely agree with that sentiment, as well as the insistence that it will take a collective effort from all quarters of society including the CRTC, governments, and private industry to make it happen. <br />\n<br />\nThe CRTC is holding hearings right now to better understand broadband connectivity across Canada. FCM appeared there April 15 to lay out the case that high-speed broadband access must be considered an essential service. This means putting in place new funding mechanisms that will support universal access in areas not served through private investments or targeted government funding programs. <br />\n<br />\nBut recognizing high-speed broadband as a basic service is only part of the solution. The CRTC must also ensure the system adapts to ever-changing technological advancements by regularly updating Canada's broadband speed targets. Otherwise we run the risk of drawing up plans for the best system with the fastest upload and download standards today only to see that system quickly become inadequate to people's needs tomorrow.<br />\n<br />\nCanada also needs to ensure our national system includes backup connections for parts of the country where Internet outages can leave people without service for days or even weeks. For example, remote regions where repairing a broken cable is a lengthy and complicated affair, or in the north where there is simply no backup for satellite interruptions. <br />\n<br />\nMaking sure high-speed service is available to everyone will require significant public and private investment. We will all need to work together to build this network. That is why FCM welcomed the federal government's commitment in the recent budget to spend an additional $500-million over the next five years to expand broadband services to rural and remote communities.

(Photo: Frank Augstein - WPA Pool/Getty Images)</em><br />\n<br />\nDear Prime Minister David Cameron,<br />\n<br />\nWe are writing on behalf of <a href=\"http://gopacnetwork.org/\" target=\"_hplink\">parliamentarians from around the world</a> and from across Britain's political parties, to make a common appeal to you, as we prepare for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/anti-corruption-summit-london-2016/about\" target=\"_hplink\">International Anti-Corruption Summit</a>, which you will convene in London later today. <br />\n<br />\nThe legislators we represent come from different cultures, speak different languages, profess different faiths and have been on opposite sides of warfare. But we are united by a common conviction: that corruption is now\u00a0one of\u00a0the single greatest threats\u00a0to the development of societies, the security of nations and human rights.<br />\n<br />\nTo give but one example, an\u00a0estimated $1 trillion is siphoned out of developing\u00a0countries each year through money laundering and other corrupt practices. By contrast, the total cost of achieving all <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\" target=\"_hplink\">eight UN Millennium Development Goals</a> would have been $0.5 trillion.\u00a0 <br />\n<br />\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><br />\n  <span class=\"quote\">By its nature, corruption breeds in the dark and withers under the glare of public scrutiny.</span><br />\n</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nThere is a better world within our grasp: a world without hunger, without thirst, without needless disease; but\u00a0corruption is stealing that world from us.<br />\n<br />\nBy its nature, corruption breeds in the dark and withers under the glare of public scrutiny. As a result, we believe that the most powerful tools to combat corruption are publicly accessible registers of beneficial ownership of corporations. These registers ensure that the true owners of corporations are known to public institutions, media and citizens. They thwart the ability of the corrupt to hide their illicit wealth and the evidence of their crimes behind a veil of corporate anonymity. <br />\n<br />\nWe applaud your leadership in creating precisely such a national register for the United Kingdom. We can not overstate the importance of your decision, especially given London's central role in global finance, nor do we underestimate the political capital you expended to take this stand. It has the potential to make the world a better place. <br />\n<br />\nBut we are deeply concerned that this potential will be left unrealized because of one catastrophic gap: Britain's Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. <br />\n<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://panamapapers.icij.org/\" target=\"_hplink\">Panama Papers</a> have starkly revealed that many of these jurisdictions have become the venues of choice for the anonymous corporations that facilitate tax evasion, organized crime and terrorist financing. Indeed, more than half the companies exposed by the Panama Papers were based in the British Virgin Islands alone. <br />\n<br />\nThe recent agreement with the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies gestures in the right direction, by committing them to create their own beneficial ownership registries. However, we are alarmed that these jurisdictions have retained the option to keep their registers closed to inspection by the public and the free press. <br />\n<br />\nWe respectfully submit that if territories under British authority are left free to give safe harbour to publicly anonymous corporations, then Britain's achievements and credibility in the global anti-corruption movement will be undermined. <br />\n<br />\nThe parliamentarians, heads of government and heads of state who will gather at the International Anti-Corruption Summit in London will be there at your call, and will therefore look to you as they judge whether this will be an exercise in words or in deeds. We urge you to seize the moment and challenge the nations of the world to follow where you lead. <br />\n<br />\nWe urge you to announce that you will ensure that there will be public registers of beneficial ownership across the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. <br />\n<br />\nYours sincerely,<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.maharaj.org/welcome.shtml\" target=\"_hplink\">Akaash Maharaj</a><br />\nCEO, Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (GOPAC)<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.nigelmillsmp.com/\" target=\"_hplink\">Nigel Mills MP</a><br />\nCo-Chair, GOPAC UK<br />\nUK All-Party Parliamentary Group on Anti-Corruption<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.catherinemckinnellmp.co.uk/\" target=\"_hplink\">Catherine McKinnell MP</a><br />\nCo-Chair, GOPAC UK<br />\nUK All-Party Parliamentary Group on Anti-Corruption<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://margaret-hodge.co.uk/\" target=\"_hplink\">Margaret Hodge PC MP</a><br />\nChair, UK All-Party Parliamentary Group on Responsible Tax<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.daviddavismp.com/\" target=\"_hplink\">David Davis PC MP</a><br />\nVice-Chair, UK All-Party Parliamentary Group on Responsible Tax<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnHydePerth\" target=\"_hplink\">John Hyde JP</a><br />\nChair, GOPAC Oceania<br />\n<br />\nMary King<br />\nChair, GOPAC Caribbean<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.parliament.gh/parliamentarians/210\" target=\"_hplink\">Osei Kyei Mensah-Bonsu MP</a><br />\nChair, GOPAC Africa<br />\nAfrican Parliamentarians' Network Against Corruption<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote><strong>Follow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook</strong><br />\n<div class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/huffpostcablogs/\" data-width=\"570\" data-show-faces=\"true\"></div></blockquote><br />\n<br />\n<strong>MORE ON HUFFPOST:</strong><br />\n<br />\n<HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--295212--HH> ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4312984/images/s-DAVID-CAMERON-ANTICORRUPTION-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/12/text-and-drive-billboard_n_9929300.html</guid>\n      <title><![CDATA[Text And Drive Billboard By Toronto 'Funeral Home' Is A Perfectly Powerful PSA]]></title>\n      <author>Joshua Ostroff</author>\n      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/12/text-and-drive-billboard_n_9929300.html?utm_hp_ref=canada-business&amp;ir=Canada+Business</link>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 11:01:30 -0400</pubDate>\n      <description><![CDATA[Anyone with kids knows that reverse-psychology is a powerful persuasion tool.

That's right. More. And while most people wouldn't even think about drinking and driving, over half of Ontario drivers admit to reading texts while behind the wheel. That's more than half of the drivers on the road today risking their lives, their passengers' lives and the lives of their fellow motorists and pedestrians.<br />\n<br />\nWhich should make you even madder than our billboard did.\"<br />\n</blockquote><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Article continues after slideshow<br />\n</strong> <HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--327768--HH><br><br />\n<br />\nClicks on the site's links for flowers, caskets and monuments revealed more statistics such as the fact that distracted drivers contributed to the deaths of 78 people in Ontario last year, killed 77 per cent more people than speeding in 2013 and that texting drivers are 23 times more likely to crash.<br />\n<br />\nThough not stated on the website, <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/darkly-clever-billboard-funeral-home-toronto-leaves-motorists-aghast-171404\" target=\"_hplink\">Adweek reports</a> that the campaign is the brainchild of Montreal ad agency John St. and Toronto outdoor ad company Cieslok Media. <br />\n<br />\n\"People see and hear the words 'Don't text and drive' almost every day, but the number of people doing it keeps going up and up,\" John St. managing director Mylene Savoie told Adweek. <br />\n<br />\n\"So we wanted to think of a different way of saying it that would make people think about the real consequences. Which is where 'Text and drive' came from.\" ]]></description>\n      <enclosure url=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4312570/images/s-TEXT-AND-DRIVE-mini.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"/>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
