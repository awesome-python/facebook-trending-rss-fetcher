From smartphones and set-top boxes to tablets and 4-G connections, everything is on offer.  For all that, the average voter remains unenthused. </p><p>The DMK had been tom-tomming that its manifesto would be the game changer. When the manifesto was released, the party offered so much that the opposition parties questioned the feasibility of its implementation. </p><p>Jayalalitha came out with her manifesto almost a month later and in the middle of her campaign. She improved upon many of the DMK's key promises and added a few of her own. </p><p>In the last lap, the DMK appears to be unsure of its manifesto's efficacy.<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G8o6f81RMRc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><p>Tamil Nadu has a long tradition of welfare politics. But the current freebie run started in 2006 when the DMK promised a colour TV set to all those households that did not have one. This marked a departure. Because welfare schemes had not been associated with a consumer durable like a TV set. </p><p>Not only did the DMK manage to win in that keenly-fought contest, but the humble TV set was credited with tilting the polls in the party's favour. The story though did not end there. Even as the DMK government distributed the television sets in phases, Karunanidhi family's hold over the administration was growing. </p><p>The opposition alleged that the free TV scheme was aimed at helping the Maran brothers - media baron Kalanithi Maran and his brother and then union minister Dayanidhi Maran. Grandnephews of Karunanidhi, the brothers had a stranglehold over the cable television distribution in the state. Soon the scheme acquired a crony capitalist dimension. For many, it was a telling example of how Karunanidhi used the levers of power to help promote his family businesses.    </p><p>Worse, when the 2G scam was raging, the DMK claimed that the fallout would be limited to the urban middle class. But media reports and poll surveys indicated that voters - in poor urban neighbourhoods and in rural areas - had come to know about the scam through their newly acquired televisions. </p><p>Battling a massive anti-incumbency wave, Karunanidhi offered mixers and grinders for women voters and laptops for college students in the 2011 assembly elections. Besides offering all these and electric fans, Jayalalitha promised laptops for higher secondary students as well. The whole exercise looked irrelevant as the people looked determined to see the back of the DMK government. The ADMK chief was only denying any possible advantage to her political rival. Interestingly, she promised to provide cable connectivity at affordable rates. </p><p>As the ADMK came to power, the free laptop scheme was launched. The students of government-aided higher secondary schools and colleges would be its beneficiaries. The programme was greeted with scepticism by the public. But some educationists felt that the scheme could achieve a great deal if backed with serious efforts. </p><p>The ADMK government stoutly defended the scheme. It was an effort to help the students, particularly those from the rural areas and poor families. With laptops, their skills and ability in computer usage would go up. They could take advantage of the information technology revolution, the government argued.</p><p>But before a digital revolution could take hold, laptops had begun to enter the flea market. Without any worthwhile servicing facility, some students sold their laptops once they developed any snag. Others found little use for the machine as they could not afford an internet connection. There were also instances where the laptops were sold simply to get over financial distress.  </p><p>In certain schools and among sections of students, the laptops did make a positive impact. Rather than crowding around a few desktops in the so-called computer labs, students pursuing computer science could have their own machines. They were also able to load programming languages onto their laptops with the help of teachers. </p><p>By and large, however, the scheme did little more than transfer laptops to students with no proper training. Students happily ended up storing only films, song clips and animated games on their laptops. Educationalists saw the whole exercise as a wasted opportunity. They felt the right curriculum, adequate teachers and infrastructure should have preceded the free laptops.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bought or imported electronic junks from China with lesser rates and given as a freebie in tamilnadu <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADMKManifesto?src=hash\">#ADMKManifesto</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/mTBVcdW904\">pic.twitter.com/mTBVcdW904</a></p>\u2014 Senthikumar Dayanidh (@Rayar1978) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rayar1978/status/728234800083968000\">May 5, 2016</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p></p><p>Even as the free laptops have been delivered, countless government colleges and schools have functioned without enough teachers.

While the mask was seen as a concept, what if we viewed it as a person? If that is the case, then that person could very well be Vajpayee\u2019s principal secretary cum National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Vajpayee-Mishra formed an odd couple. Vajpayee was an out and out Sangh hardliner and totally unacceptable to Lutyens Delhi. Mishra was the son of a Congress Chief Minister close to legendary Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">An IFS man, ambassador and a permanent representative to the United Nations, Mishra was the ultimate insider and had contacts that spanned the entire network of Lutyens Delhi. In fact while Vajpayee was looked with suspicion, Mishra was welcomed with open arms.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">So successful was Mishra that most of Lutyens Delhi had totally got used to Vajpayee and backed another term for him by 2004. The surprise loss and the Vajpayee-Mishra exit made the BJP a pariah yet again.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">In fact Mishra was an excellent mukhauta of Vajpayee and the two had become inseparable.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">When another hardliner in the form of Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, people thought that he would be different and he wouldn\u2019t need a mask. But a mask he took all the same. And that mukhauta was Arun Jaitley.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Jaitley, like Mishra,<a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/how-everybody-loves-arun-jaitley-news-columns-pmwpk3ebbdfjd.html\"> is the perfect Lutyens insider and everybody loves him</a>. He can deal with the Congress and every other party. The media rarely attacks him and if #AdarshLiberals had to pick one BJP politician they would be willing to do business with, then it would probably be Jaitley.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Like Vajpayee-Mishra, Modi-Jaitley too formed the odd couple. Jaitley would make Modi acceptable and make deals with the Opposition and handle the Congress well. Or so most thought!</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">After two years, the partnership seems to have broken down. The Congress is on the warpath. Bills are not being passed. Modi is being attacked virulently (not Jaitley though). The Enforcement Directorate (under Finance Minister Jaitley) doesn\u2019t seem to have looked much into cases like the National Herald.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">BJP supporters are getting impatient as to how nobody, not even \u201cprivate citizens\u201d like Robert Vadra and Karti Chidambaram have been arrested despite the umpteen allegations floating against them in the media.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">In fact Jaitley is powerful within the BJP, has good relations with the Congress, other parties and media. However, you only have to look to Twitter and see the rage against him where he is seen as an ineffectual figure too soft on the opposition.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">The turning point seems to be the Delhi and Bihar Assembly polls where the BJP got absolutely plastered in the former and saw a loss of face in the latter. If you note closely, then that seemed to be the turning point.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Modi seems to have toughened his stand. The ED and other investigative bodies seemed to have suddenly become more active. BJP MPs are trying to go on the offensive instead of defending the party lamely.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">The leaks have increased and it is no co-incidence that the Congress is getting one bad news after another with the latest being AgustaWestland. Nothing symbolizes the new attitude than maverick Subramanian Swamy who joined the BJP some time back and became a Rajya Sabha MP recently.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">It seems the proverbial cat has been set among the pigeons. Swamy seems to have taken over the Rajya Sabha proceedings completely. Everything is about him. It\u2019s either his speeches or attacks against him or his remarks which have been expunged.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar gave such a detailed point by point and factual account of AgustaWestland that the government finally seems serious in taking Congress President Sonia Gandhi head on.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Swamy also brought up controversial and hardline things like the Ram Mandir issue which seemed to be on the backburner to many BJP supporters. The BJP has changed and become more aggressive and the new face of this is definitely Swamy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Swamy has even launched an attack indirectly on a mysterious person called \u201cSakuni\u201d on Twitter which his supporters staunchly claim is Jaitley. It is difficult to see all this being done without the consent of Modi.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">In fact another Jaitley baiter Navjot Singh Sidhu (allegedly upset at losing his Amritsar ticket to Jaitley) also entered the Rajya Sabha with Swamy. There are rumours of Modi considering a new Finance Minister. Jaitley\u2019s role seems to have been much diminished in the Modi Raj.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">From 1998-2004, Mishra was Vajpayee\u2019s mukhauta.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">From 2014-2016, Jaitley was Modi\u2019s mukhauta.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">So the question to be asked is: Is Swamy now Modi\u2019s new mukhauta?</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">If that\u2019s the case, then there is one major difference. While Mishra and Jaitley are moderates and Lutyens insiders, that is not the case with Swamy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">Swamy is more hardline than Modi. Swamy is more of an outsider than Modi. Swamy is hated more in Lutyens Delhi than Modi. Swamy is more attacking than Modi.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">During the 2002 elections Modi made his famous \u201cHum paanch hamare pachees\u201d barb against Muslims but got his act together after that. Look at all of Modi\u2019s speeches from 2013 onwards and you will struggle to find things that will mark him as an RSS hardliner. It\u2019s all about development and governance.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">That is not the case with Swamy who speaks on Hinduism, Ayodhya, Uniform Civil Code, putting Sonia in jail etc more openly and strongly. In fact Swamy even called Mishra a Trojan horse for the Congress in a recent interview!</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">While hardline Vajpayee wore a moderate mask, it seems that hardline Modi has just taken on an ultra hardline mask! Either way, this marks a new turning point in Modi\u2019s term. Watch this space closely!</p></span><br><div><b>Read More:</b></div><p><font color=\"#0000ee\"><b><u><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/why-i-totally-support-uber-s-surge-pricing-news-columns-qfglA8cfaffad.html\">Why I totally support Uber's surge pricing...</a></u></b></font><br><br><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/how-everybody-loves-arun-jaitley-news-columns-pmwpk3ebbdfjd.html\"><b>How everybody loves Arun Jaitley!&nbsp;</b></a><br><br><b><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/time-to-snap-all-ties-with-pakistan-immediately-news-columns-qbgjR4djcdjff.html\">Time to snap all ties with Pakistan immediately?</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br><b><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/national-herald-case-is-this-the-end-game-for-sonia-gandhi-news-columns-pmvlJjhghejge.html\">National Herald Case: Is this the end-game for Sonia Gandhi?&nbsp;</a><br><br></b><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/25-controversies-of-narendra-modi-imagegallery-features-plqmnodhgeieg.html\"><b>25 controversies of Narendra Modi</b></a><br><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/seven-reasons-to-fear-lalu-prasad-yadav-news-columns-plmh4pihchaia.html\"><b><br></b></a><a href=\"http://www.sify.com/news/seven-reasons-to-fear-lalu-prasad-yadav-news-columns-plmh4pihchaia.html\"><b>Seven reasons to fear Lalu Prasad Yadav</b></a><br><br><img src=\"http://im.sify.com/index2/images/apr2011/Sunil_11april11_100x100.jpg\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; vertical-align: middle; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><i>The author is a Bangalore-based journalist and blogger.
