(See <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-four-things-i-learned-from-the-donald-trump-primary/\">Trump, Donald</a>.) But the general election is off to a predictable start. Three <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/2016-presidential-swing-state-polls/release-detail?ReleaseID=2345\">Quinnipiac polls</a> released on Tuesday, showing Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton neck and neck in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, got far more attention than they deserved. That\u2019s not because Trump can\u2019t win those states, or the election. Rather, we\u2019re still six months from Election Day and no single poll should receive much attention. Moreover, I would caution against getting bogged down in state polls &#8212; even of swing states. The truth is &#8212; with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000\">some notable exceptions</a> &#8212; winning the national popular vote typically means winning the presidency; the Electoral College matters only in very close elections, and most of the time not even then.</p><h2>1. The chance of an Electoral College and popular vote split is small.</h2><p>Pundits love talking about scenarios in which one candidate wins the Electoral College and the other wins the popular vote. But like the fabled contested convention &#8212; it felt <i>so</i> close this year &#8212; such a split is usually more fantasy than reality. It\u2019s happened just three times in the last 47 elections, going back to <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/\">1828</a> (by which point the vast majority of states began allocating their electoral votes by the winner of the popular vote in that state).<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"1\" href=\"#fn-1\"><sup id=\"ss-1\">1</sup></a> Most elections simply aren&#8217;t all that close. During the <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?type=national&amp;year=2012&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">past 50 years</a>, for example, in only two elections has the national popular vote been within 2 percentage points.</p><p>And even in close elections, an Electoral College/popular vote split isn\u2019t especially likely. Research by <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266218904_Election_Inversions_by_the_US_Electoral_College\">Nicholas R. Miller</a>, a political scientist at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, has found that &#8212; all else being equal &#8212; there\u2019s about a 25 percent chance of a split if the national popular vote is decided by about 1 percentage point, and that the chance is cut in half when the margin is 2 percentage points. We all remember the razor-thin margin in the 2000 election, when George W. Bush won the presidency even though Al Gore won the popular vote. But we forget that the 1960 and 1968 <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?type=national&amp;year=2012&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">elections</a> were about equally close but didn\u2019t produce a split. Jimmy Carter in 1976 and George W. Bush in 2004 <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?type=national&amp;year=2012&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">won relatively clear victories</a> in the Electoral College while winning the popular vote by a little more than 2 points. If the national popular vote margin is greater than 4 percentage points, Miller found, the chance of a split is about zero.</p><p>Why are Electoral College/popular vote splits unlikely, even in tight races? Here\u2019s one reason: Swing states aren\u2019t swing states by accident. Especially in the aggregate, they tend to reflect the nation as a whole.</p><h2>2. Without looking at all the states, we don&#8217;t know how to interpret state polls.</h2><p>When incumbent presidents run for re-election, the electoral map tends to be fairly consistent with their first campaign. States that were competitive in 2008, for example, were also competitive in 2012 (with a couple of exceptions). Statistically, President Obama\u2019s <a href=\"http://imgur.com/rAbhgHk\">2012 vote share</a> in a state can be predicted within 4.5 percentage points, 95 percent of the time, just by knowing how much the national popular vote changed and how well Obama did in that state in 2008.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"2\" href=\"#fn-2\"><sup id=\"ss-2\">2</sup></a></p><p>But the map is far more likely to change in open elections, like 2016, when no incumbent president is running. In <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/data.php?year=2008&amp;datatype=national&amp;def=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">2008</a>, the state that voted most like the country overall was Virginia; Obama won the nation by 7.3 percentage points and Virginia by 6.3 points. Virginia also held that honor in <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/data.php?year=2012&amp;datatype=national&amp;def=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">2012</a> &#8212; Obama won both the nation and the state by 3.9 percentage points. But <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/data.php?year=2004&amp;datatype=national&amp;def=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">in 2004</a>, President George W. Bush won Virginia by over 8 percentage points while winning nationwide by a little less than 2.5 points. Nevada was actually the national bellwether in 2004, but Obama won it by double digits in 2008. Statistically, Obama&#8217;s vote share <a href=\"http://imgur.com/SyeZYsh\">in 2008</a> could be predicted only within 6.4 percentage points, 95 percent of the time, based on 2004 state-by-state data.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"3\" href=\"#fn-3\"><sup id=\"ss-3\">3</sup></a> That error rate is nearly 2 percentage points higher than when Obama was running for re-election.</p><p>The point is that the 2012 electoral map may not apply in 2016. Let\u2019s say Clinton leads Trump by 6 percentage points in North Carolina, as an average of the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-north-carolina-president-trump-vs-clinton\">three polls conducted there</a> in the past month suggests. So what? We don\u2019t necessarily know what that says about the race overall.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p><em>Listen to the latest episode of the FiveThirtyEight <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/podcasts/\">elections podcast</a>.</em></p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]--><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-114934-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%; visibility: hidden;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"\" src=\"https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278&#038;_=1\" /><a href=\"https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278\">https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278</a></audio><h3>Subscribe: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/fivethirtyeight-elections/id1077418457?mt=2\">iTunes</a> |<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=14554755\">Download</a> |<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/feeds/itunes/podCast?id=14554755\">RSS</a> |<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fivethirtyeight/videos\">Video</a></h3><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><h2>3. We don\u2019t have a lot of state polls.</h2><p>State polling is really good when we have a lot of it. That was one lesson of 2012, when the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/oct-30-what-state-polls-suggest-about-the-national-popular-vote/\">state polling in aggregate</a> gave us a better picture of the national popular vote than the national polls did. And 2012 was not a fluke: State polls taken at the end of a campaign are often more telling than the national polls because there are lot more of them, among many different unique electorates.</p><p>But that math works only when you have a lot of state polling. From the first presidential debate last year in early October to Election Day, there were 126 polls taken in <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-florida-president-romney-vs-obama\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-ohio-president-romney-vs-obama\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-pennsylvania-president-romney-vs-obama\">Pennsylvania</a> combined. According to HuffPost Pollster, only 96 <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-general-election-romney-vs-obama\">national general-election polls</a> were taken over the same period. In all of 2016 so far, we\u2019ve had <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-florida-presidential-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">only</a> <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-ohio-president-trump-vs-clinton\">21</a> <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-pennsylvania-president-trump-vs-clinton\">polls</a> in these three states combined. That\u2019s equal to the number of Clinton vs. Trump polls that have been <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">conducted nationally</a> in the last <i>month</i>.</p><p>The lack of state polling also potentially means individual polls receive more attention at a time when it\u2019s hard to tell which surveys are outliers and which are real. You could get all worked up about the recent <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-pennsylvania-president-trump-vs-clinton\">Quinnipiac poll</a> that showed Trump within 1 percentage point of Clinton in Pennsylvania. But you&#8217;d be ignoring a recent <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-pennsylvania-president-trump-vs-clinton\">Marist poll</a> that had Clinton up 15 percentage points. With limited statewide polling data, we don\u2019t know which is closer to the truth or whether whatever the truth is means anything for the national race at large.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p>You\u2019re going to hear a lot about the Electoral College this cycle. At various points, one state or another will be declared pivotal. But stay calm, especially with so long to go until Election Day. It\u2019s too early to take any poll too seriously. We\u2019ll have plenty of time to get into the weeds of different Electoral College scenarios in the months to come. For now, if you\u2019re interested in whether Trump or Clinton is likely to be our next president, I\u2019d pay attention to the <i>average</i> of national polls. Let\u2019s wait until we\u2019re closer to the election and we have a lot more state polling before we zoom in closer than 30,000 feet.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=114934&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<subtitle>Yet.</subtitle>\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_38320736523.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_38320736523.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Hillary Clinton</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a26fad23742e906c3f881ae92c6178cb?s=96&#38;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">poughies</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Gay Marriage Won, But Other Liberal Causes Will Probably Struggle To Copy Its Success</title>\n\t\t<link>http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gay-marriage-won-but-other-liberal-causes-might-struggle-to-copy-its-success/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 19:37:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Daniel Cox]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Abortion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Same-Sex Marriage]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&#038;p=114939</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The dramatic triumph of the same-sex-marriage movement has sparked considerable interest from advocates of other causes &#8212; from climate change to immigration reform to abortion access &#8212; who would love to figure out a way to copy its special sauce.

Few social movements have experienced such rapid success. On no other issue have public sentiment and politics been transformed so quickly and completely. By 2015, when the Supreme Court affirmed the legality of same-sex unions in <i><span></span>Obergefell v. Hodges</i>, a majority of the public <a href=\"http://ava.publicreligion.org/#lgbt/2015/States/lgbt_ssm/2\">(53 percent)</a> favored allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry. Today, a majority of residents in <a href=\"http://ava.publicreligion.org/#lgbt/2015/States/lgbt_ssm/2,3\">only five states</a> &#8212; Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, South Dakota and Tennessee<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"4\" href=\"#fn-4\"><sup id=\"ss-4\">4</sup></a> &#8212; continue to oppose same-sex marriage.</p><p>But those seeking to replicate the movement\u2019s success have their work cut out for them. The campaign to legalize same-sex marriage was helped along by a number of factors that are difficult &#8212; if not impossible &#8212; for others to copy.</p><h2>More friends and family than ever are openly gay</h2><p>Few things have more fundamentally altered public opinion on same-sex marriage than the increasing presence of openly gay and lesbian people in America\u2019s social networks. In 1993, only <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/research/2014/02/2014-lgbt-survey/#.VyjQCpMrJ_8\">22 percent</a> of Americans reported that they had a close friend or family member who was gay or lesbian. By 2009, the proportion had risen to roughly half (49 percent). Today, about two-thirds (<a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/research/2014/02/2014-lgbt-survey/#.VyjQCpMrJ_8\">65 percent</a>) of Americans have a close friend or family member who identifies as gay or lesbian.</p><p>This matters because research dating to the 1950s has <a href=\"http://www.iaccp.org/sites/default/files/pettigrew_tropp_2006_contact_theory_0.pdf\">consistently shown</a> that social contact with members of particular communities eases prejudice and distrust. Social contact has been shown to reduce racial animus, religious prejudice and, more recently, antipathy toward gay and lesbian people. One reason negative stereotypes and discomfort with homosexuality endured so long was that relatively few people formed close relationships with those who were openly gay.</p><figure id=\"attachment_114943\"class=\"wp-caption aligncenter \"style=\"max-width: 575px\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-114943\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/cox-same-sex-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"cox-same-sex-1\" width=\"575\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/cox-same-sex-1.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=575&amp;ssl=1 1x, http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/cox-same-sex-1.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1150&amp;ssl=1 2x\" /></figure><p>Social contact is a particularly effective way of reducing anti-gay sentiment because gay and lesbian identity is independent of the socio-economic, <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/research/2014/08/analysis-social-network/#.VygX9pMrJ_8\">ethnic, racial,</a> religious and regional divisions that separate Americans on other issues. While coming out is more complicated in certain parts of the country and within certain communities, gay and lesbian people are members of every social class, ethnicity, religion and race. White Americans are much more likely to have a close friend or family member who is gay than black, even though black Americans vastly outnumber gays and lesbian people. (I know these groups are not mutually exclusive.) Since the early 1990s, Americans collectively met and welcomed many more gay and lesbian people into their families and social circles.</p><h2>Same-sex marriage legalization was viewed as inevitable</h2><p>Shortly after same-sex marriage became a national issue, most Americans thought that legalization was inevitable. In 2004, it looked like an uphill battle: Only <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2015/07/29/graphics-slideshow-changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/\">31 percent</a> of the public favored legalization, and much of that support was tepid. Most Democrats wanted little to do with the issue, while Republicans were rallying against it as a cause for the 2004 presidential campaign. Yet even in such an inhospitable environment, roughly 6 in 10 Americans said legal recognition of same-sex marriage was only a matter of time.</p><p>Even Americans who were most ideologically committed to banning same-sex marriage were not terribly confident in their ability to stop it. In 2004, 47 percent of Republicans said legal recognition was a foregone conclusion, while 42 percent said it was not. By 2013, nearly three-quarters of the public <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/06/gay-marriage-poll_n_3396895.html\">(72 percent)</a> believed it was inevitable.</p><figure id=\"attachment_114942\"class=\"wp-caption aligncenter \"style=\"max-width: 575px\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-114942\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/cox-same-sex-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"cox-same-sex-2\" width=\"575\" height=\"542\" srcset=\"http://i2.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/cox-same-sex-2.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=575&amp;ssl=1 1x, http://i2.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/cox-same-sex-2.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1150&amp;ssl=1 2x\" /></figure><p>As the sense of inevitability grew, it became more difficult for opponents to mount and fund their campaigns. Well before same-sex marriage was legal and at a time when public opinion was still roughly divided, the flagship organization fighting it &#8212; the National Organization for Marriage &#8212; saw its fundraising drying up; the group raised roughly <a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/lifestyle/blogs/bostonspirit/2012/11/national_organization_for_marr.html\">30 percent less in 2011</a> than it did in the previous year.</p><p>Even some political opponents of same-sex marriage signaled an early retreat on the issue. In 2013, for instance, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., indicated he would not have a problem supporting a presidential candidate who was for same-sex marriage, saying, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/31/jeff-flake-gay-marriage_n_2988661.html\">I think it\u2019s inevitable</a>.\u201d Few things are more demoralizing to any effort than thinking you\u2019ve already lost.</p><h2><span></span>Same-sex marriage became a touchstone issue for millennials</h2><p><span></span>Yes, millennials. Numbering about <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-113.html\">83 million</a>, people born between the years 1980 and 2000<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"5\" href=\"#fn-5\"><sup id=\"ss-5\">5</sup></a> have expressed greater support for same-sex marriage, more vocally and consistently, than any other generation. The average family with a young adult had at least one proponent of same-sex marriage sitting around the Thanksgiving table.</p><p><span></span>Millennials also exerted considerable pressure, albeit mostly indirectly, on some of the most critical institutional opponents of same-sex marriage: places of worship. In 2013, <a href=\"http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/03/03/poll-70-percent-of-us-millennials-say-religious-groups-alienating-youth/\"><span></span>70 percent of millennials</a> said religious groups were alienating young people by being too judgmental on gay and lesbian issues. A 2014 survey found that <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014.LGBT_REPORT.pdf\"><span></span>more than 1 in 3 millennials</a><span></span> who left the church said negative treatment of gay and lesbian people was the reason. The same decade that saw same-sex marriage emerge as a major flashpoint in the culture wars, following its legalization in Massachusetts in 2003, also witnessed an unprecedented exodus from organized religion among young adults &#8212; from 18 percent identifying themselves as religiously unaffiliated in 2003 to 36 percent in 2015. In comparison, between 1974 and 2003 the proportion grew just 6 percentage points (12 percent to 18 percent).</p><p><span></span>To avoid antagonizing millennials, many religious denominations abandoned blanket denunciations of gay and lesbian people and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/05/17/313313870/southern-baptist-leaders-seek-softer-approach-to-homosexuality\">dialed back harsh rhetoric</a> on homosexuality; many adopted <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/08/europe/vatican-pope-family/\">more nuanced positions</a>. In other instances, religious leaders simply avoided the topic. A majority (<a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2003/11/18/religious-beliefs-underpin-opposition-to-homosexuality/\">55 percent</a>) of Americans who attended religious services in 2003 heard their clergy talk about the issue of homosexuality; by 2012 only <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/10/31/in-deadlocked-race-neither-side-has-ground-game-advantage/\">33 percent</a> said their clergy had recently addressed the topic.</p><h2>Same-sex marriage rode a rising tide of social acceptance</h2><p>The movement to legalize same-sex marriage may also have uniquely benefited from rising social acceptance of personal sexual behavior. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/183413/americans-continue-shift-left-key-moral-issues.aspx\">Gallup</a><span></span> has tracked substantial changes in the public\u2019s attitude about divorce, premarital sex, having a child out of wedlock and same-gender sexual relations. Fewer than half of Americans (45 percent) thought it was morally acceptable to have a child out of wedlock in 2002; by 2015 the number had risen to 61 percent. Acceptance of same-gender sex increased by an even larger margin over this period. These trends are almost certainly related to the growth in the ranks of the religiously unaffiliated, who now represent nearly 1 in 4 Americans. As a group, these Americans consistently embrace much more tolerant views on a range of sexual behaviors.</p><section class=\"viz\"><table class=\"viz full\"><thead><tr><th class=\"upper\" style=\"border-right-width:10px;border-right-style:solid;border-right-color:#ffffff;\" colspan=\"1\"></th><th class=\"upper upper-text\" style=\"border-right-width:10px;border-right-style:solid;border-right-color:#ffffff;width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\">SHARE WHO THINK BEHAVIOR IS MORALLY ACCEPTABLE</th><th class=\"upper\" style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"1\"></th></tr><tr><th class=\"no-parent text\" colspan=\"1\">BEHAVIOR</th><th class=\"number\" style=\"font-weight:400;width:16%;\" colspan=\"1\">2001</th><th class=\"number\" style=\"font-weight:400;width:16%;\" colspan=\"1\">2015</th><th class=\"no-parent number\" style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"1\">CHANGE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"text bold\">Gay or lesbian relations</td><td class=\"number bold\" style=\"width:16%;\">40%</td><td class=\"number bold\" style=\"width:16%;\">63%</td><td class=\"number highlight bold\" style=\"width:16%;\">+23</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\">Having a baby outside of marriage*</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"width:16%;padding-right:1.1em;\">45</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"width:16%;padding-right:1.1em;\">61</td><td class=\"number highlight\" style=\"width:16%;\">+16</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\">Sex between an unmarried man and woman</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"width:16%;padding-right:1.1em;\">53</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"width:16%;padding-right:1.1em;\">68</td><td class=\"number highlight\" style=\"width:16%;\">+15</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\">Divorce</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"width:16%;padding-right:1.1em;\">59</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"width:16%;padding-right:1.1em;\">71</td><td class=\"number highlight\" style=\"width:16%;\">+12</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\">Abortion</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"width:16%;padding-right:1.1em;\">42</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"width:16%;padding-right:1.1em;\">45</td><td class=\"number highlight\" style=\"width:16%;\">+3</td></tr></tbody><caption>More people are more tolerant</caption></table><footer class=\"viz\"><p class=\"notes\">&#8220;Having a baby outside marriage&#8221; was first measured in 2002</p><p>Data from surveys of 1,012 respondents from May 10-14, 2001 and 1,024 respondents from May 6-10, 2015</p><p class=\"source\">Source: Gallup</p></footer></section><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p>Few of the factors that helped push same-sex marriage over the finish line would seem to benefit those seeking to keep abortion legal or to prompt government action on climate change.</p><p><span></span>First, the millennial generation is not a slam dunk for those advocates. Despite being more diverse and socially liberal, millennials are not more likely than Americans overall to believe <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2014/09/22/section-3-social-political-issues/\">abortion should be legal</a> or to say climate change is a priority.</p><p>Second, the broad diffusion of gay and lesbian people into American social networks is not something that campaigns can simply write into their communications strategy. Some advocates are trying: Planned Parenthood <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2014-10-06/how-do-you-change-someones-mind-about-abortion-tell-them-you-had-one\">recruited female canvassers</a> in Southern California to talk with voters about abortion, and during the conversation the canvasser revealed that she had personally had an abortion. But <a href=\"https://www.sociologicalscience.com/articles-vol1-26-466/\">research has shown</a> that women who have had abortions are most likely to share their stories with people they perceive as being most sympathetic; for many gay and lesbian people, coming out is a defining experience and a central part of their identity. Examples of their coming out to conservative parents <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/republicans-gay-marriage-117400\">abound</a>. On the issue of climate change, Americans would be hard pressed to share a personal story about how the issue has touched them personally, since most do not believe that their lives have really <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/2015/06/americans-think-climate-change-is-a-serious-threat-for-other-people/#.VwLJyRMrJTZ\">been affected by it</a>.</p><p><span></span>Third, few Americans believe that one side will inevitably prevail in the debates over abortion and climate change. The opposing forces are well funded and organized, and can rely on political allies at the federal, state and local level.</p><p>Finally, there is no indication that the growing comfort with human sexuality will benefit abortion-rights advocates or &#8212; obviously &#8212; those battling climate change. Abortion is the one issue about which Americans have not become more accepting, while climate change would seem to have little to do with alternative social arrangements and personal behaviors.</p><p>None of this is to say that these advocates, organizations and movements are doomed to failure. But their success probably lies along a different path.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=114939&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-164687271.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-164687271.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">US-JUSTICE-GAY-MARRIAGE</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a5ffee70795912de4bc78ad6a72a447a?s=96&#38;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">micahscohen</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/cox-same-sex-1.png\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">cox-same-sex-1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/cox-same-sex-2.png\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">cox-same-sex-2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Sitting Presidents Give Way More Commencement Speeches Than They Used To</title>\n\t\t<link>http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sitting-presidents-give-way-more-commencement-speeches-than-they-used-to/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 16:49:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Carl Bialik]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Barack Obama]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Higher Education]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&#038;p=114920</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[President Obama is giving the 23rd commencement address of his presidency this Sunday at Rutgers University, and his 24th and last at the Air Force Academy on June 2.

Since Harry Truman took office in 1945 &#8212; the start of complete commencement-speech records in the <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/\">American Presidency Project&#8217;s</a> archive &#8212; presidents have spoken at graduations of military academies 44 times, other public schools 54 times and private schools 53 times. Those counts include colleges, universities and high schools &#8212; but not the <a href=\"http://www.capitolpagealumni.org/about-us/\">Capitol Page School</a>, graced four times by Lyndon Johnson and once each by Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. (The chart above includes the Capitol page addresses.)</p><p>Obama&#8217;s speech at Howard was the ninth by a president at a historically black college or university since 1979, when <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=32372\">Jimmy Carter spoke at Cheyney State College</a>. Presidents have given more commencement speeches at HBCUs (11) than at Ivy League schools (9).</p><p>Obama has spoken widely, in 17 states and D.C., while giving commencement addresses no more than three times in any one state (New York). But even his travels can&#8217;t right the historical imbalance in geographical diversity of presidential commencement speeches. Presidents are busy, so 36 times they chose to take a short trip within Washington, Maryland and Virginia &#8212; making more speeches in those three places than in 37 states combined.</p><p>Obama, seeking to reach a wide range of students, takes into account a number of factors in choosing schools for his commencement speeches, such as the size of the school, its location and the speaking schedules of Michelle Obama and Joe Biden, a White House spokeswoman said.</p><p>Obama\u2019s run as a president giving commencement speeches is up this year, but he\u2019ll likely have many more chances to address graduates in the years to come.

A lot of people have been talking up the idea, and we\u2019ll get into whether an independent run is logistically feasible and who would make a good independent candidate. But first, let\u2019s dive into why people are so taken with the notion of a truly viable independent candidate. Is there something about the current political climate or modern politics generally that makes a successful independent bid more likely? (Define \u201csuccessful\u201d loosely.)</p><p><b>harry (</b><a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/harry-enten/\"><b>Harry Enten</b></a><b>, senior political writer):</b> Allow me to reel off a few reasons:</p><ol><li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Most Americans think the country is <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/us-right-direction-wrong-track\">on the wrong track</a>. If you look back at the last big third-party bid, <a href=\"http://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/presidential-elections/1992-presidential-election/\">in 1992</a>, you see similar right direction/wrong track numbers.</li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\">Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the two presumptive nominees, are <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton-is-record-breaking/\">extremely disliked</a>. That\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/23/us/1992-campaign-poll-bush-clinton-sag-survey-perot-s-negative-rating-doubles.html?pagewanted=all\">somewhat similar</a> to 1992, with the first George Bush and Bill Clinton, and to a lesser extent with Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in 1980.</li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\">We have a major ideological split within the Republican Party. This reminds me of 1980, when some more liberal Republicans were unhappy with Reagan &#8212; the most conservative Republican nominee <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rick-perry-fell-harder-than-anyone-and-hes-the-first-to-try-again/\">since 1964</a> and, IMO, probably the second most conservative nominee since Herbert Hoover in 1932. Reagan <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Ronald_Reagan.htm\">was also</a> anti-abortion, which John Anderson, a Republican who ran as an independent in 1980, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1980/02/john-anderson-the-nice-guy-syndrome/306028/\">was not</a>. You also saw major-party splits that presaged George Wallace\u2019s independent run in 1968 and Strom Thurmond\u2019s in 1948.</li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\">A feeling that both candidates are the same. That is, the real need for an outsider. Now, this is interesting because Trump is kind of a third-party candidate within the Republican Party. But since some traditional Republicans feel displaced, they may get behind a third-party candidate. The idea that both candidates are the same was also in the air when <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/elections/nadertext110100.htm\">Ralph Nader ran in 2000</a>, and to some degree when Thurmond and Henry Wallace ran in 1948.</li></ol><p><b>natesilver (</b><a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/\"><b>Nate Silver</b></a><b>, editor in chief):</b> I feel like you\u2019re missing No. 5 (although it somewhat contradicts No. 4): The degree of partisanship is higher than ever.

There was Henry Wallace, whose voters largely defected to Harry Truman in the late stages of the race, helping Truman win. But there was also Strom Thurmond. Both got <a href=\"http://millercenter.org/president/biography/truman-campaigns-and-elections\">2.4 percent</a> of the popular vote, but only Thurmond got electoral votes. Independent candidates who have a broad base of support spread evenly across the nation can have less of an effect on the Electoral College than regional candidates.</p><p><b>harry: </b>And then you get someone like Ross Perot, who got <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">nearly 20 percent</a> of the national vote in 1992 and received 0 electoral votes.</p><p><b>farai: </b>I mean, in some ways Trump is a bit of a Trojan horse &#8212; an independent who happens to be using the GOP as the equivalent of a shell corporation.</p><p><b>micah: </b>Yeah, that seems right to me.

(I think Farai is right.)</p><p><b>harry: </b>To me, this year pretty much meets all the criteria for at least a moderately successful third-party candidacy. That doesn\u2019t mean it will happen, of course.

[Editor&#8217;s note: Right after we finished this chat, Cruz <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/cruz-rules-out-third-party-bid-223021\">told reporters</a> in Washington that he had &#8220;no interest&#8221; in a third-party bid.]</p><p><b>harry: </b>Just to be clear, we already have a bunch of third parties running: candidates from the Green Party and Libertarian Party, for example. Don\u2019t be surprised if Gary Johnson (if he becomes the nominee) gets a higher percentage of the vote than the Libertarian candidate typically does.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>Yeah, there\u2019s some question about what a token-ish #NeverTrump independent candidate would get you that Gary Johnson wouldn\u2019t. Libertarians already have ballot access in 30-something states.</p><p><b>micah: </b>So you think it makes more sense for #NeverTrump to rally with Johnson rather than run a movement conservative like #PaulRyan?</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>Can you get a movement conservative as Johnson\u2019s VP? Libertarians haven\u2019t held their convention yet. Obviously, it\u2019s different if you have a Mitt Romney run, or something.</p><p><b>micah: </b>Rubio.</p><p><b>harry: </b>The dream shall never die.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>RU-BEE-OH! RU-BEE-OH!</p><p><b>micah: </b>Really, though &#8212; none of this is going to happen, but in terms of the political space left unfilled in a Trump vs. Clinton election, I think Romney &lt; Rubio &lt; Cruz (Nate\u2019s Rubio adoration notwithstanding). But I\u2019m not sure whether #NeverTrump should go with Johnson or a Cruz-like candidate &#8212; what\u2019s more effective if your goal is stopping Trump?</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>I\u2019m just saying that you have to consider Johnson in your VORC (value over replacement candidate) calculation. If the alternative is some backbench U.S. representative or something, he\u2019s not going to get very many votes that Johnson wouldn\u2019t, you might not have a lot of enthusiasm for petitions to get him on the ballot, and the efforts might be better spent getting Libertarians on the ballot in more states. If it\u2019s Romney or someone with a national profile, that\u2019s way different.</p><p><b>harry: </b>Johnson got <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2012&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">1 percent</a> of the vote in 2012 without much of a yearning for an outsider.</p><p><b>farai: </b>When you have third-party and independent candidates, there\u2019s a vast difference between voters who make judgments purely based on platforms/ideas and ones who do viability math. Some possible Ralph Nader voters in 2000 abandoned his candidacy when they felt it might jeopardize the Democratic Party\u2019s chances; same with Henry Wallace, the Progressive, in <a href=\"http://millercenter.org/president/biography/truman-campaigns-and-elections\">1948</a>. So, circling back to what Harry said about there being lots of third parties already, the issues-based voters may have already aligned with the third parties, but the two-party system makes picking a third party extremely difficult for people who care about viability and likelihood of winning. That\u2019s very different from multiparty democracies in much of the world, and their coalition governments.</p><p><b>harry: </b>Well, there are multiple reasons third/independent candidacies fail in the U.S. One of those is our first-past-the-post or plurality voting system.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>What\u2019s different this year is that there are some voters, especially movement conservative Republicans, who really might consider their cause better off if Trump loses than if he wins, but who also get a chill in their spine at the thought of having to vote for Clinton. It\u2019s not a large share of the population. It might be 2 or 3 percent or something. But that could make a difference if the election tightens.</p><p><b>farai: </b>Nate, do you think anyone who that demographic would vote for could actually mount a campaign this late in the game?</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>It\u2019s hard to guess. If Trump had wrapped up the nomination one month sooner, it would have been more likely. If he hadn\u2019t wrapped it up until June, it would have been less likely. We\u2019re on the precipice, and my hunch is that it ultimately won\u2019t pan out, but I really have no idea.</p><p><b>micah: </b>So we talked a bit about the current conditions that are favorable to an independent bid. What\u2019s working against such a run?</p><p><b>harry: </b>Money, for one. It takes a lot of money to run for president. President Obama spent over $700 million in <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/\">2012</a>, and Romney spent about $450 million.</p><p><b>farai: </b>Here are some charts from the Brookings Institution that show the filing deadlines to get on the ballot in each state, and what\u2019s required in each.</p><figure id=\"attachment_114842\"class=\"wp-caption aligncenter \"style=\"max-width: 575px\"><a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/fixgov/posts/2016/03/23-independent-bid-for-the-presidency-kamarck\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-114842\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/brookings_1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"brookings_1\" width=\"575\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/brookings_1.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=575&amp;ssl=1 1x, http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/brookings_1.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1150&amp;ssl=1 2x\" /></a></figure><figure id=\"attachment_114841\"class=\"wp-caption aligncenter \"style=\"max-width: 575px\"><a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/fixgov/posts/2016/03/23-independent-bid-for-the-presidency-kamarck\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-114841\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/brookings_2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"brookings_2\" width=\"575\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/brookings_2.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=575&amp;ssl=1 1x, http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/brookings_2.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1150&amp;ssl=1 2x\" /></a></figure><p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine who can mount a run with the time we have left. Someone like Bloomberg who\u2019s extremely wealthy could probably assemble a viable machine, but the sheer mechanics of running a campaign are just daunting.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>Yeah, the filing deadline in Texas has already passed, and you\u2019d have to sue to try to get ballot access. Other deadlines are coming up pretty soon. But mainly \u2026 such a bid is quite unlikely to be successful.</p><p><b>farai: </b>Exactly. Most voters are pragmatic about the choices offered and base their vote, at least in part, on a candidate\u2019s chance of winning.</p><p><b>micah: </b>So besides the logistical stuff, isn\u2019t it true that voters just aren\u2019t that into it?</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>Not exactly. It also has to do with the dynamics of the Electoral College and winner-take-all elections.</p><p><b>farai: </b>It\u2019s always worth remembering we have one version of democracy, even of American democracy. We\u2019d be different if <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fusion\">fusion voting</a> were national, as it was in the past. And certainly if we had multiparty democracy, we\u2019d see a broader range of political parties.</p><p>But the workings of the Electoral College are everything in the end, and a third-party candidate winning any electoral votes has tended to mean having a successful hyper-regional campaign. So from 1940 until today, the only two third-party candidates to win electoral votes were segregationists Strom Thurmond (<a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1948&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">1948</a>) and George Wallace (<a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1968&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">1968</a>). Thurmond won about 2.4 percent of the popular vote and 39 electoral votes, and Wallace won 13.5 percent of the popular vote and 46 electoral votes.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>Unless a third-party candidate is drawing <i>exactly</i> evenly from the two party bases, he tends to be a spoiler. Say the election starts out Clinton 52 percent, Trump 48 percent. A third-party candidate takes 10 percent from Trump and 5 percent from Clinton. That winds up being Clinton 47, Trump 38, third party 15, which will look like a Clinton landslide.</p><p>But even if the third-party candidate gets 35 percent of the vote or something, they\u2019ll tend to finish second in a lot of places \u2014 second behind Clinton in blue states, and second behind Trump in red states.</p><p><b>harry: </b>That is, as Farai said, unless they are a regional candidate. That\u2019s why Thurmond and George Wallace were bigger players &#8212; at least in terms of the electoral college &#8212; than say Anderson and Henry Wallace.</p><p>But how about this question: Who were the voters <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ted-cruz-may-be-too-conservative-to-stop-trump/\">most opposed</a> to Trump in the Republican primary? Very conservative voters and well-educated moderates. What type of candidate would appeal to those constituencies? And could that person possibly reach out to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bernieorbust\">#bernieorbust</a> folks as well?</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>Harry, that\u2019s part of why I\u2019m saying Gary Johnson could do relatively well, unless you have someone else with real star power. The well-educated moderates will vote for Johnson, and a few Bernie types might. Not sure the religious conservatives would, but he\u2019s at least there as a relatively harmless protest vote.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p><em>Listen to the latest episode of the FiveThirtyEight <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/podcasts/\">elections podcast</a>.</em></p><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-114824-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%; visibility: hidden;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"\" src=\"https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278&#038;_=2\" /><a href=\"https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278\">https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278</a></audio><h3>Subscribe: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/fivethirtyeight-elections/id1077418457?mt=2\">iTunes</a> |<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=14554755\">Download</a> |<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/feeds/itunes/podCast?id=14554755\">RSS</a> |<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fivethirtyeight/videos\">Video</a></h3><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p><b>micah: </b>OK, let\u2019s wrap this up &#8212; anything else we want to cover?</p><p><b>harry: </b>One thing to watch out for is the cumulative share of the vote earned by third-party candidates. It could be that Johnson takes 4 percent, Jill Stein gets 1 percent, the Constitution Party gets 0.3 percent, etc. That is, the third-party candidates get more support than usual, but it\u2019s spread over a few different candidates.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>You could also have some undervoting \u2014 people who skip the presidential race and just vote for Senate, etc., instead. This gets a little tricky from a polling standpoint and may be one reason we see differences in the polls later this year. Pollsters tend to \u201cpush\u201d voters pretty hard toward picking one of the major-party choices. If an above-average number will vote third party, or undervote, or write someone in, or just stay home, that pushing might not be a good idea.</p><p><b>farai: </b>Also, any parties that get 5 percent in a presidential election then get federal matching funds in the next election.

Shirley MacLaine <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119923872081461417\">claimed</a> that former Rep. Dennis Kucinich shared a UFO sighting with her, but you\u2019d have to believe in something a lot less plausible than aliens to think he had a chance of prevailing in his 2004 or 2008 presidential campaigns and getting the chance to open the books.</p><p>A decade ago, about one in four Americans believed there was something to reveal. In a <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/16915/three-four-americans-believe-paranormal.aspx\">2005 poll by Gallup,</a> 24 percent of Americans believed that \u201cextra-terrestrial beings have visited Earth.\u201d In an earlier, 1997 ABC News Poll,<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"7\" href=\"#fn-7\"><sup id=\"ss-7\">7</sup></a> only 16 percent of Americans thought that UFO sightings were caused by real alien spacecraft, as opposed to weather balloons, odd weather, or, in the case of noted skeptic Michael Shermer, <a href=\"http://www.michaelshermer.com/2005/02/abducted/\">a too-long bike ride</a>.</p><p>Americans have been a little more optimistic that we\u2019ll meet aliens eventually. In the Pew Research Center\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-questionnaires/51.pdf\">1999 Millennium Survey</a>, 27 percent of Americans thought we would probably or definitely make contact with alien life in the next 50 years. (Pew didn\u2019t ask if people expected the government would \u2019fess up when that finally happened.)</p><p>If Clinton wants to make a play for voters with beliefs in unproven phenomena, there are larger constituencies than the Roswell truthers. That 2005 Gallup poll found that over half of Americans (55 percent) believed in the power to heal people mentally, and other psychic powers also are rated as more believable than aliens (ESP: 41 percent, telepathy: 31 percent).</p><p>To win these voters\u2019 support, Clinton might need to go through the military\u2019s files on psychic experiments in the 1980s as part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project\">Stargate Project</a>, where recruits tried to influence or kill animals by concentrating.

The <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/west-virginia-democratic/#polls-only\">FiveThirtyEight polls-only</a> model forecasts a 7-percentage-point Sanders win, while the <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/west-virginia-democratic/\">polls-plus model</a> gives him a 3-point edge.</p><p>West Virginia also looks like a strong state for Sanders demographically, with few nonwhite voters. A <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/today-is-clintons-chance-to-end-the-groundhog-day-campaign/\">demographic model</a> my colleague Nate Silver released in late April projected Sanders to carry the state by 15 percentage points. That would be his <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/data.php?year=2016&amp;datatype=national&amp;def=1&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=1\">biggest win in a primary</a> outside his home state of Vermont and its neighbor New Hampshire. (He\u2019s had bigger wins in caucuses.)</p><p>Sanders&#8217;s West Virginia strength rests in large part on the state\u2019s lack of racial diversity. It is <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/14_5YR/B03002/0100000US.04000\">93 percent non-Hispanic white</a>, the third-highest share of any state. The only other states where at least 90 percent of the population identifies as non-Hispanic white are Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. Sanders won each of those by at least 20 percentage points. Meanwhile, Clinton\u2019s strongest supporters have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls\">black voters</a>, and just 3 percent of West Virginia&#8217;s population is non-Hispanic black.</p><p>The other key pro-Sanders factor in West Virginia: It holds a <a href=\"http://voteforbernie.org/\">semiclosed primary</a>, meaning that unaffiliated voters can take part in either party\u2019s primary. Sanders has done <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-sanders-does-better-with-independents/\">exceedingly well</a> among voters who identify as independent,<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"8\" href=\"#fn-8\"><sup id=\"ss-8\">8</sup></a> according to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls\">exit polls</a>. Just last week <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/in/Dem\">in Indiana</a>, for example, he lost among self-identified Democrats by 6 percentage points and won self-identified independents by 44 points.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p><em>Listen to the latest episode of the FiveThirtyEight <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/podcasts/\">elections podcast</a>.</em></p><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-114706-3\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%; visibility: hidden;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"\" src=\"https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278&#038;_=3\" /><a href=\"https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278\">https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278</a></audio><h3>Subscribe: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/fivethirtyeight-elections/id1077418457?mt=2\">iTunes</a> |<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=14554755\">Download</a> |<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/feeds/itunes/podCast?id=14554755\">RSS</a> |<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fivethirtyeight/videos\">Video</a></h3><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p>All in all, a lot of signs point to a Sanders win in West Virginia.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"9\" href=\"#fn-9\"><sup id=\"ss-9\">9</sup></a> Unfortunately for Sanders, even the best projections won&#8217;t allow him to cut too deeply into <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/\">Clinton&#8217;s lead of 285 elected delegates</a>.

Oh, ye of little faith.</p><p>Given that Donald Trump is almost certainly going to be the Republican nominee, there is going to be plenty to dissect over the next few weeks.

What does a Trump-led GOP look like? What does it stand for?</p><p>Lots of drama went down this week and we must start at the very beginning, with Trump winning the state of Indiana last Tuesday, Ted Cruz<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ted-cruz-drops-out-2016-campaign-obituary/\"> dropping out</a> that same night, and John Kasich<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-long-weird-kasich-campaign-gives-in-to-reality/\"> following suit</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>People hadn\u2019t yet had a full 48 hours to roll the words \u201cnominee Trump\u201d around in their mouth before House Speaker Paul Ryan came out on Thursday with what amounts to a bombshell these days &#8212; making a nuanced statement on<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/05/politics/paul-ryan-donald-trump-gop-nominee/\"> CNN</a>.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just not ready to [endorse] at this point,&#8221; Ryan<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/us/politics/paul-ryan-donald-trump.html\"> said</a>. \u201c\u201cI think conservatives want to know: Does [Trump] share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution?\u201d</p><p>Trump responded in a<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-paul-ryan\"> statement</a>, &#8220;I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan&#8217;s agenda.\u201d</p><p>The <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-it-paul-ryans-party-or-donald-trumps-party/\">Ryan-Trump beef</a> has dominated the political news, and over the weekend, stories<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/08/trump-wont-rule-out-effort-to-remove-ryan-as-convention-chairman/\"> surfaced</a> that Trump wouldn\u2019t rule out efforts to remove Ryan from his position as chairman of the Republican National Convention. Then, Sarah Palin got her<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xqDKKcdra8\"> pitbull-in-lipstick</a> on &#8212; it\u2019s actually more a high-sheen nude gloss these days &#8212; when she gave an<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/08/politics/sarah-palin-paul-ryan-paul-nehlen-endorsement/\"> interview</a> Sunday and said that she would support Ryan\u2019s primary challenger, promising that the Speaker would be \u201c &#8216;Cantored,&#8217; as in Eric Cantor,&#8221; a reference to the former House majority leader who <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/eric-cantors-loss-was-like-an-earthquake/\">lost to a challenger from the right</a> in 2014.</p><p>Ryan isn\u2019t the only high-profile Republican dissenter; in a Facebook<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jebbush/posts/876702172458827\"> post</a> on Friday, Jeb Bush wrote: \u201cIn November, I will not vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, but I will support principled conservatives at the state and federal levels, just as I have done my entire life.\u201d Two days before, on Wednesday, Bush\u2019s father and brother &#8212; two guys who used to be president \u2013 announced that they would not be supporting Trump<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bush-presidents-wont-endorse-donald-trump/\"> either</a>.</p><p>Still, some Republicans are lining up behind Trump. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released a<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-222826#ixzz487MLdg7W\"> statement</a> supporting Trump that was notable for its legalistic parsing: \u201cI have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters, and Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, is now on the verge of clinching that nomination.\u201d John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008, said that he would<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/08/john-mccain-demands-donald-trump-apologize-to-veterans/\"> support</a> Trump but also excoriated the businessman over his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/us/politics/trump-belittles-mccains-war-record.html\">previous comments</a> about prisoners of war.

Are we witnessing the culmination of decades of rising anger among the masses against out-of-touch elites, driven by the party\u2019s own campaign strategies? Or does this crisis go away if Trump is not elected?</p><p>There\u2019s plenty of evidence on both sides, but one way of getting at this question is to ask, as a reporter did of me recently, what would happen if political scientists could somehow run 2016 over again without Trump. Would we still see such a large number of presidential candidates and such late winnowing? Would we still see party insiders so apparently unable to coordinate around a preferred favorite? Would some other wealthy outsider have taken control of the process?</p><p>Obviously, we can\u2019t run such a counterfactual election, but we can examine Republican nomination contests occurring at the state level across the country right now. After all, if the GOP really is experiencing a hostile takeover, we should be observing this beyond just the presidential level. Party changes <a href=\"http://politicalscience.jhu.edu/2015/09/01/when-movements-anchor-parties-electoral-alignments-in-american-history/\">tend</a> to <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379406001156\">occur</a> from the ground up, rather than the top down.</p><p>To narrow down the study a bit, let\u2019s first look at open-seat Senate and gubernatorial primaries in competitive states where there\u2019s substantial competition for the Republican nomination. I wanted to see what sorts of Republicans are running and which candidates seem to be leading the contests.</p><p>What I found was a substantial number of experienced, mainstream Republicans leading in their races for major office, which does not suggest a party that is cracking up.</p><p>Below, I go through those races, looking at the extent of government experience for the leading candidates. (I received some help from <i>Governing</i>\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.governing.com/authors/Louis-Jacobson.html\"> Louis Jacobson</a> in this effort.)</p><h2>Senate</h2><p>In <b>Florida</b>, nine candidates have entered the race for the Republican nomination to succeed Sen. Marco Rubio, who decided not to seek re-election in order to run for president. Those candidates vary widely in experience and background, but the three <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/fl/florida_senate_republican_primary-5340.html\">consistent poll leaders</a> have been two congressmen, Ron DeSantis (with two terms in the House), and David Jolly (who is in his second term and worked for the previous incumbent in his district), and Lt. Gov. Carlos L\u00f3pez-Cantera (in his first term, but who served in the statehouse for a decade). These three have received <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_election_in_Florida,_2016\">the bulk of funding and endorsements</a> in the race, as well.</p><p>Another nine candidates are vying for the GOP nod in the race to replace Sen. Harry Reid of <b>Nevada, </b>the minority leader, who last year announced his decision to retire after five terms. The only two candidates with <a href=\"https://www.ralstonreports.com/blog/poll-heck-destroying-angle-gop-primary-us-senate\">any serious showing in the polls</a> are Sharron Angle, the tea party candidate who was defeated by Reid for the seat in 2010, and Rep. Joe Heck, a third-term incumbent and a former state senator. Heck is strongly favored for the nomination, judging from polls.</p><p>In <b>Indiana</b>, Sen. Dan Coats is retiring, and there were only two Republicans competing to succeed him, both of whom are currently congressmen. Marlin Stutzman has been in the House since 2010 and previously served as a state legislator, while Todd Young has also been in office since 2010 and previously worked for the Heritage Foundation and Sen. Richard Lugar. Young, who was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/05/03/gop-looks-to-buck-trumpmentum-in-indiana-senate-primary/\">backed by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell</a>, won <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2016/05/03/young-wins-gop-senate-primary-over-stutzman/83828728/\">easily</a>.</p><h2>Governor</h2><p>In <b>New Hampshire,</b> Gov. Maggie Hassan is leaving office to run for the Senate. Four candidates are running for the Republican nomination to replace her. The early leader in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_gubernatorial_election,_2016#Republican_primary\">polling</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nhinsider.com/press-releases/2015/11/19/sununu-for-nh-governor-nh-governors-endorse-chris-sununu.html\">endorsements</a> is Chris Sununu, the son of John H. Sununu, formerly governor and White House chief of staff, and the brother of former Sen. John E. Sununu.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"10\" href=\"#fn-10\"><sup id=\"ss-10\">10</sup></a> The other candidates include a state senator, a state representative, and the mayor of Manchester, the state\u2019s largest city.</p><p>Meanwhile, in <b>Missouri</b>, Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, cannot run for a third term because of state term limits. The leading Republican candidate to replace him is Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, although former state House Speaker Catherine Hanaway is putting in a decent showing <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2015/08/missouri-senate-governors-races-competitive.html\">in the polls</a>. Two other Republican candidates \u2014 businessman John Brunner and Navy SEAL Eric Greitens \u2014 are trailing substantially.</p><p>We can expand the field of races a bit by looking at the<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-in-competitive-races-have-shunned-trump/\"> incumbent Republican senators and governors facing re-election this year in competitive states</a>. Are they facing unusually strong primary challengers? Not really. Neither Govs. Pat McCrory (North Carolina) nor Mike Pence (Indiana) faced serious candidates in their primaries. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire is facing a primary challenge from former state senator Jim Rubens, although Rubens hasn\u2019t served in office since 1998. Senators Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Ron Johnson (Wisconsin), and Pat Toomey (Pennsylvania) are running unopposed for re-nomination. Senators Roy Blunt (Missouri), Johnny Isakson (Georgia), Mark Kirk (Illinois), John McCain (Arizona), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), and Rob Portman (Ohio) do not seem to be facing serious primary challengers. Sen. Richard Burr (North Carolina) is running 30 percentage points ahead of his nearest challenger.</p><p>Obviously, these campaign dynamics can shift, and a candidate who appears to be a minor challenger now can rise to become an important one in a few months. Recent election cycles suggest, for example, that<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/eric-cantors-loss-was-like-an-earthquake/\"> Republican incumbents are doing worse in primary races than they used to</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_114656\"class=\"wp-caption aligncenter \"style=\"max-width: 575px\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-114656\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/silver-datalab-teaprimary-1-new-style1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"silver-datalab-teaprimary-1-new-style\" width=\"575\" height=\"490\" srcset=\"http://i2.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/silver-datalab-teaprimary-1-new-style1.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=575&amp;ssl=1 1x, http://i2.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/silver-datalab-teaprimary-1-new-style1.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1150&amp;ssl=1 2x\" /></figure><p>It\u2019s too early to update this chart with the 2016 Republican primaries, but there\u2019s little evidence that the party\u2019s officeholders are under a massive assault this year. Of course, that doesn\u2019t necessarily disprove the notion that the Republican Party is experiencing some level of turmoil.</p><p>We can also look at a pretty simple raw number \u2014 the total number of people who have filed to run for Congress by party.<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2015/12/22/10640494/republican-recruitment\"> Since 2010</a>, more Republicans than Democrats have filed to run for Congress. This was most notable in the big tea party insurgency year of 2010. But since then, the gap between the parties has subsided, as the chart below shows. This year, 1,356 Republicans and 1,136 Democrats have filed to run for Congress. If you limit the count to people who have recorded donations, it\u2019s 717 Republicans versus 577 Democrats.</p><figure id=\"attachment_114650\"class=\"wp-caption aligncenter \"style=\"max-width: 575px\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-114650\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/masket-down-ballot-fixed.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"masket-DOWN-BALLOT-fixed\" width=\"575\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/masket-down-ballot-fixed.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=575&amp;ssl=1 1x, http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/masket-down-ballot-fixed.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1150&amp;ssl=1 2x\" /></figure><p>What all this suggests is that we\u2019re not witnessing in down-ballot races a Trump-like assault on the Republican Party from the outside. The sorts of people who are running in open seats at the state level and are in positions to win are the sorts of people who have traditionally done well \u2014 seasoned politicians with roots in state politics.</p><p>A Trump nomination could well be costly for the party. If <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">current polls are any indication</a>, they could lose the presidency by a substantial margin, dragging down quite a few members of Congress and state legislators in the process, especially if Trump\u2019s presence on the ballot drives up Democratic turnout. But the party should be able to recover from that. The presidency is obviously important to a party, but it is not all that a party is.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=114621&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_556494056853.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_556494056853.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Donald Trump</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a5ffee70795912de4bc78ad6a72a447a?s=96&#38;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">micahscohen</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/silver-datalab-teaprimary-1-new-style1.png\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">silver-datalab-teaprimary-1-new-style</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/masket-down-ballot-fixed.png\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">masket-DOWN-BALLOT-fixed</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Four Things I Learned From The Donald Trump Primary</title>\n\t\t<link>http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-four-things-i-learned-from-the-donald-trump-primary/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 20:55:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Harry Enten]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016 Election]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016 Republican Primary]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Polling]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&#038;p=114605</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[There are a lot of mea culpas floating around from people who thought it would snow in July &#8212; in Miami &#8212; before Donald Trump became the Republican nominee for president.

I, to take one example, was wrong on Trump. (Although, strictly speaking, I never mentioned snow in Miami; no, I <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/why-donald-trump-isnt-a-real-candidate-in-one-chart/\">said</a> \u201cTrump has a better chance of cameoing in another \u201c<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104431/trivia\">Home Alone</a>\u201d movie with Macaulay Culkin &#8212; or playing in the NBA Finals &#8212; than winning the Republican nomination.\u201d) I wrote a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-harry-enten-got-wrong-in-2015/\">pre-emptive mea culpa</a> back in December, when it was already clear that my initial skepticism of Trump was overconfident. But anytime something so unexpected happens, it\u2019s worth stepping back and thinking about what we should learn. Here are four initial thoughts:</p><h2>1. Don\u2019t rule out the ahistorical when there\u2019s little history.</h2><p>My skepticism of Trump boiled down to this: No party had ever nominated someone like him. In the modern era, parties have tended to nominate ideologically reliable candidates who are also electable &#8212; for Republicans, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marco-rubio-the-electable-conservative/\">electable conservatives</a>. Trump seemed neither electable nor <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Donald_Trump.htm\">all that conservative</a>.</p><p>Indeed, Trump\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 didn\u2019t resemble those of recent nominees of either party. Since nominees began to be selected mostly by caucuses and primaries in 1972, no major-party candidate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Republican_Party_presidential_tickets\">without elected office experience</a> had won. Not since Wendell Willkie in 1940 has a party nominated a candidate who wasn\u2019t either <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Republican_Party_presidential_tickets\">a politician or a war hero</a>.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that this data set is incredibly small. There have been only 14 party primaries without an incumbent president running for re-election since 1972. Any pattern that appears in such a small data set <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw9qqvm-LT8\">may have occurred only by chance</a>. At the very least, the relationship may not be as strong as it appears to be.</p><h2>2. Take a nuanced view of the polls.</h2><p>I focused on a lot of data in the summer, fall and winter of 2015 &#8212; before I really started to think Trump had a chance. We had data on <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Donald_Trump.htm\">Trump\u2019s ideology</a> and <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/\">his lack of party support</a>. We had <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">data suggesting</a> he\u2019d face long odds in a general election. But I focused too little on polls that clearly showed Trump with a good chance of winning the primary. I should have given them more weight, especially as the Iowa caucuses neared.</p><p>Trump led in the vast majority of polls. I went back and looked at the 549 polls in our <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/national-primary-polls/republican/\">national primary polling database</a> taken after Trump entered the race June 16. He led in 500, or 91 percent.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"11\" href=\"#fn-11\"><sup id=\"ss-11\">11</sup></a> More than that, Trump jumped into the lead very quickly. He led in 75 percent of the polls taken in July, and it only climbed from there. As Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy and Janie Velencia wrote Thursday at <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nomination-polls_us_572b3a3be4b0bc9cb045c503?utm_hp_ref=%40pollster\">The Huffington Post</a>, &#8220;A Trump nomination shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise based on polls.&#8221;</p><p>The same thing goes with state-level polls. Although Trump <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/iowa-republican/\">struggled in Iowa</a> and ultimately lost there, he led in 83 of the 86 <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-hampshire-republican/\">New Hampshire surveys</a> conducted after he declared his candidacy. Trump was ahead in 43 of the 45 polls taken in <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/south-carolina-republican/\">South Carolina</a> after he jumped into the race. Even in Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio&#8217;s home state, Florida, which Trump used to exorcise Rubio from the race, Trump was ahead in <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/florida-republican/\">49 of the 50 polls</a> with field dates entirely after his entry.</p><p>Why did I ignore these polls? Early polls, even a month before a primary election, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/polls-suggest-trump-will-win-between-8-percent-and-64-percent-of-the-vote/\">haven\u2019t been very predictive</a>. The candidates typically have <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-brief-history-of-primary-polling-part-ii/\">varying levels of name recognition</a>; most voters <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-media-stop-freaking-out-about-donald-trumps-polls/\">don\u2019t make up their mind</a> until right before they cast a ballot. We all remember President Howard Dean, right? Yet, there were plenty of other candidates who led in the polling throughout and won, such as George W. Bush in 2000. I still think it was right to be highly skeptical of the polls in the summer and fall of 2015. But as Trump <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/national-primary-polls/republican/\">maintained and even expanded his lead</a> into 2016, I should have been quicker to give them more weight than I gave to the lack of a precedent for Trump. (I <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/super-tuesday-could-be-historic-for-trump/\">did do this eventually</a>; it just took too long.)</p><h2>3. Maybe favorability ratings aren\u2019t as hard to change as we thought.</h2><p>I didn\u2019t ignore the polls completely. Instead, I focused on <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/why-donald-trump-isnt-a-real-candidate-in-one-chart/\">Trump\u2019s low favorability ratings</a>. That wasn\u2019t a mistake. The error was in not recognizing that favorability numbers can change as much as horse race numbers &#8212; even for a well-known politician &#8212; and that a candidate in a large field may need only a base of strong supporters to win.</p><p>Trump had very negative net favorability ratings before he entered the race, scoring a -35 percentage point net favorability rating among Republicans in a <a href=\"http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/1c2a9e72-6933-46c4-9d68-87d264821039.pdf\">Monmouth University survey</a> in June. Usually, that would be a death sentence for a candidate. Trump, though, was able to swing that quickly and scored a +17 percentage point net favorability rating in an <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-popularity-rises-negative-clinton-regains-positive-territory/story?id=32450539\">ABC News/Washington Post poll</a> the next month.</p><p>Trump\u2019s strength came from a core of supporters who viewed him \u201cvery favorably.\u201d Consider that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/15/National-Politics/Polling/question_15746.xml?uuid=tMHhMCreEeWWDyLEupgu1A\">ABC News/Washington Post poll</a>. Trump had a net favorability rating 16 percentage points lower than <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/15/National-Politics/Polling/question_15747.xml?uuid=uCHjhCreEeWWDyLEupgu1A\">Jeb Bush</a>\u2019s. But Trump also had a \u201cstrongly favorable\u201d rating of 30 percent, higher than Bush\u2019s 19 percent. Trump\u2019s supporters were a solid bloc, while opinions were far softer for the other candidates. Trump\u2019s strongly favorable rating really didn\u2019t move over the course of the campaign. Even by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/30/National-Politics/Polling/question_15972.xml?uuid=aCGIEGdiEeW9tmhh9FISBQ\">September</a>, when his net favorability rose, his strongly favorable rating was still 31 percent in the ABC News/Washington Post poll. When his net favorability dropped by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/04/14/National-Politics/Polling/question_16174.xml?uuid=DJ281AIwEeaLsfEkpD-E3A\">early April</a>, his strongly favorable rating barely moved.</p><h2>4. Don\u2019t assume the party knows what it\u2019s doing.</h2><p>Political parties have been fairly powerful institutions. And I thought Republican elites &#8212; party operatives, elected officials, grass-roots activists &#8212; would work tirelessly (and efficiently) to stop Trump. You could see Trump\u2019s lack of party support in the <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/\">endorsement race</a>. Trump received very few endorsements from <a href=\"https://2016endorsements.wordpress.com/\">local</a> and national political figures, and most of the ones he got came well after the primaries started. Historically, that hasn\u2019t been characteristic of winning candidates. In fact, Trump is the <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/\">first candidate since at least 1980</a> to win the nomination of either party while having fewer endorsements than another candidate on the day he became the presumptive nominee.</p><p>The problem was that the party didn\u2019t or was unable to coordinate on whom to support as an alternative to Trump. Even when there seemed to be <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-party-is-deciding-on-rubio/\">some rallying to Marco Rubio</a> in the late winter, most major party officials were staying on the sideline. We saw this most clearly with Ted Cruz &#8212; very few major officials rallied to his cause. Maybe in the year of the \u201canti-establishment,\u201d this didn\u2019t matter. After all, state legislators were more likely to endorse Cruz than national officials. Either way, voters went in a different direction.</p><p>Still, we don\u2019t truly know what the 2016 Republican results mean for the idea that party elites can influence presidential primaries (or as it\u2019s shorthanded, the theory that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Party-Decides-Presidential-Nominations-American/dp/0226112373\">the party decides</a>\u201d). Hillary Clinton had an early, <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/\">commanding lead in endorsements</a> on the Democratic side, and she seems to be on a glide path to the nomination.

On the whole, though, more of what he did worked than didn\u2019t work. Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html\">generated a ton of free media coverage</a>; that helped him. He was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/02/15/donald-trump-jeb-bush-george-w-bush-911-attacks.cnn\">willing to challenge Republican orthodoxy</a>; that, at the very least, didn\u2019t hurt him. I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s built a new political coalition or the Trump phenomenon is sui generis, but whatever the guy did, it worked.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p>Whatever happens with Trump in the general election, it was a humbling experience for the guy writing these words to you now. The lesson I take from it is you shouldn&#8217;t dismiss polling data, even when it doesn&#8217;t line up with your priors. That&#8217;s especially the case when your priors are informed by a small number of elections.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=114605&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_16127608992006.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_16127608992006.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Donald Trump</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a26fad23742e906c3f881ae92c6178cb?s=96&#38;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">poughies</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Is It Paul Ryan\u2019s Party Or Donald Trump\u2019s Party?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-it-paul-ryans-party-or-donald-trumps-party/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 17:59:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nate Silver]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016 Election]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Paul Ryan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Slack Chat]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&#038;p=114569</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[In a special \u201cemergency\u201d politics Slack chat, we marvel at &#8212; and consider the implications of &#8212; House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s non-endorsement of Donald Trump.

The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p><b>micah</b> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/micahcohen\">Micah Cohen</a>, politics editor): Not two days after he took the reins of the Republican Party, Trump has gotten into it with the Republican speaker of the House, Ryan, one of the few GOP leaders with enough stature and credibility to rhetorically arm wrestle with the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee. To be fair, Ryan started it, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/05/politics/paul-ryan-donald-trump-gop-nominee/\">going on CNN and saying</a> about backing Trump, &#8220;I&#8217;m just not ready to do that at this point. I&#8217;m not there right now.\u201d</p><p>Another few choice quotes:</p><ul><li style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u201cI think what a lot of Republicans want to see is that we have a standard-bearer that bears our standards.\u201d</li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u201cI think conservatives want to know, does he share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution?\u201d</li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u201cThere are lots of questions that conservatives, I think, are going to want answers to, myself included. I want to be a part of this unifying process. I want to help to unify this party.\u201d</li></ul><p>So, is this the first crack in the foundation of the Republican Party? Is it a minor disagreement that\u2019ll get patched up? Is Ryan just trying to maintain some leverage over Trump to keep him &#8212; at least a little &#8212; in line?</p><p><b>clare.malone</b> (<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/clare-malone/\">Clare Malone</a>, senior political writer): We should also include the <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-paul-ryan\">Trump response</a>, since he was basically counter-punching, as he is wont to do:</p><blockquote><p>I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan&#8217;s agenda. Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!</p></blockquote><p><b>julia.azari</b> (<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/julia-azari/\">Julia Azari</a>, associate political science professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): There are two fault lines here: One between Trump and Ryan/<a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/dismayed-romney-says-he-doesnt-intend-to-back-trump-worried-about-demagoguery-and-populism/article/2590558\">Mitt Romney</a>/<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bush-presidents-wont-endorse-donald-trump/\">the Bushes</a>/etc.; and one between that latter group and the established party leaders who are supporting and going to support Trump (<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/mike-pence-endorses-trump-222891\">Mike Pence</a>, perhaps the <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/rnc-denies-asked-staffers-leave-trump\">Republican National Committee</a>), even though they weren&#8217;t part of his movement initially.</p><p>These have different implications. A party at odds with its nominee can be at least partly written off as an organizational failure. A party at odds <i>over</i> its nominee has got bigger problems.</p><p><b>harry</b> (<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/harry-enten/\">Harry Enten</a>, senior political writer): Honestly, I don\u2019t know the answer to your question, Micah. But there are a number of Republicans who feel the way Ryan does. Not the majority of them, but some of them. Lots of polls show some straggling Republicans in getting aboard the S.S. Trump. In the latest <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/05/04/rel6b.-.2016.general.pdf\">CNN poll</a>, for example, Trump gets the support of only 83 percent of respondents who lean Republican. Clinton gets 91 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners.</p><p><b>natesilver</b> (<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/\">Nate Silver</a>, editor in chief): Stepping back here, consider how unusual it is for a party nominee to be opposed by <i>any</i> major figure within his or her party.</p><p><b>micah: </b>Well \u2026 it\u2019s freaking crazy. Has it happened before?</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>When Georgia Senator Zell Miller opposed John Kerry in 2004, it was considered a pretty big deal. And Miller was a Democrat-in-name-only who had a voting record like a typical Republican.</p><p>This time, the freaking speaker of the House isn\u2019t able to endorse the nominee. So to some extent, it will be interesting to see whether (say) 70 percent or 80 percent or 90 percent of Republican party elites eventually get behind Trump. But since the usual benchmark is 99 percent or 100 percent, it\u2019s a big story either way.</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>I think this is a smart move by Ryan, and one he can point back to when he eventually runs for president &#8212; he\u2019s probably going to end up supporting Trump, but he can say to people in four years, \u201clook, I was being thoughtful/skeptical about the direction Trump was leading our party.\u201d</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>This goes back to <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-political-parties-splinter/\">the piece I wrote a couple months ago</a> about party splits: When people grumbled or even opposed, say, William Howard Taft in 1912 or Hubert Humphrey in 1968, it was because there was a clear divide in the party over something &#8212; in both those cases, that party controlled the presidency and nothing splits a party like having to respond to its own ideas in practice. This is really, really Trump-focused.</p><p>Also, if you all will indulge me in a little 19th century party history: Supporting the presidential nominee was the <i>essence</i> of what it meant to be a political party back then. You could deviate from the party on policy (true in both parties) in order to please your local constituents, but you had to support the nominee if you wanted to stay in the party. Now it&#8217;s kinda the opposite in the Republican Party.</p><p><b>harry: </b>I think Julia makes a really interesting point. I wonder though is it Trump-focused as much as it is what Trump stands for? How many people are merely opposed to what they see as heated rhetoric versus his stance on say taxes, as you could argue Ryan is?</p><p><b>micah: </b>Harry, we\u2019ll get to that in one second, but first: Is it possible the Republican Party basically splits into two groups, both still called the Republican Party, and one runs for president and one cares about Congress, and the two don\u2019t really talk that much or support each other?</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a lot, especially since the tea party, which paved the way for Trump in some ways, is a Congress-focused movement. It never gained traction in presidential politics.</p><p>The electoral map supports this. Challenging someone in a primary is way easier to do to members of Congress. And Republicans control some, you know, really red districts as well as some light red ones. But the presidential map is a much bigger challenge since urban areas dominate states like Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York.</p><p><b>harry: </b>Of course, wasn\u2019t the tea party thought of as mostly a conservative movement?</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>The Freedom Caucus in Congress is an interesting thing to look at when we\u2019re talking about party fission.</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>Yeah. So <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9954.html\">tea party supporters</a> look like<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-trump-supporters-were-doing-before-trump/\"> Trump supporters</a> in their racial/ethnic attitudes but not in their social issue attitudes or opinion of, say, Obamacare. But I think the structural connection is key there. The Freedom Caucus loosened up the party and made it acceptable and normal to challenge established figures. Trump followed their lead.</p><p><b>micah: </b>Is the Freedom Caucus in Ryan\u2019s camp? Trump\u2019s camp? Neither?</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>I bet they will split.</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>They have been intransigent party members for years. \u2026 I\u2019m not quite sure people have the stomach right now to up and create a whole new party, but it seems pretty unsustainable to simply bicker endlessly without wounding yourself pretty badly in the future (also, that\u2019s maybe already happened). I think the Freedom Caucus doesn\u2019t have a camp yet \u2026 but I\u2019d be willing to bet they\u2019ll get down with Trump, Micah.</p><p><b>micah: </b>Interesting \u2026 so that brings us to policy, which seemed to be Ryan\u2019s chief concern, i.e. \u201cI think conservatives want to know, does he share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution?\u201d</p><p>But as Washington Post reporter Philip Rucker pointed out, do GOP voters even care about that crap anymore?</p><div class=\"non-jetpack-embed \"><div class=\"embed-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">He also beat 16 people who more closely align w/ Ryan agenda, meaning Trump likely won&#39;t give much ground on policy <a href=\"https://t.co/qfyaFyyBxC\">https://t.co/qfyaFyyBxC</a></p><p>&mdash; Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilipRucker/status/728558500671049728\">May 6, 2016</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></div><p><b>harry: </b>I think most people don\u2019t care. BUT! There is a section of people who do care. Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/01/12/gop-image-race-strong-tops-conservative/\">a YouGov poll</a> from January (just before the primaries started) in which only 14 percent of Republicans said Trump was a \u201ctrue conservative.\u201d He, of course, still held a 16-percentage-point lead over Ted Cruz in that survey.</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>Ryan is trying to make the party a more policy-driven one again. This necessarily (and not just for Republicans) means it cannot be hyper-responsive to every emotion its voters have. Sorry to be elitist, but I think that&#8217;s just true.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>I mean, the cynical interpretation is that voters come to the Republican Party for the cultural resentment, and then Ryan et al try to sell them on the movement conservatism once they\u2019re in the building.</p><p>Trump suggests that not only is movement conservatism not the main draw, but you don\u2019t really need it at all. Although I\u2019d caution, as always, that Trump <i>could</i> be a sui generis case caused by, for instance, total dominance of media coverage.</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>What percent of the Republican primary vote did Trump win?</p><p><b>micah: </b><a href=\"http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/R\">Forty percent</a>. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure I agree with you, Clare \u2014 aren\u2019t the members of the Freedom Caucus movement conservatives? Or maybe what they care about most is throwing rocks at the establishment, and Trump is one hell of a rock?</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>I think if we\u2019re talking about people who have been on the outside of the power establishment &#8212; the Freedom Caucus &#8212; and they see that a new pole of power is coming into existence in the party &#8212; Trump &#8212; it\u2019s a savvy move to jump on board and at least drag off his popularity.</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>See, I think the issue is that the definition of &#8220;movement conservative&#8221; is now muddled. For some it&#8217;s rock-throwing. For some it&#8217;s social and/or economic conservatism. Cultural stuff for others. Having not been sufficiently wrong about enough things this year, I&#8217;ll boldly predict that the Freedom Caucus will divide on their Trump support.</p><p><b>micah: </b>Bold!</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>Well. I don&#8217;t know if it actually will. But I\u2019ll make that prediction. I really want to be in one of those &#8220;who was wrongest&#8221; pundit round-ups.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>When I\u2019m using the term \u201cmovement conservatism,\u201d I mean a Reaganish or G.W.B.ish agenda. Supply-side economics, hawkish foreign policy (U.S. as leader of the free world), \u201cfamily values.\u201d</p><p>Also, it\u2019s not actually that fun to be in one of those roundups, Julia.</p><p><b>harry: </b>The group that Trump consistently did worst with in the primary was those who identified as \u201cvery conservative\u201d and those who attended church more than once a week.</p><p><b>micah: </b>Let me shift this discussion \u2026 should Trump give a sh*t what Ryan says?</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>Yes. He needs institutional support to run a national campaign, and Ryan is a big part of securing that machine power that you need.</p><p><b>harry: </b>Yes. Yes, he should.</p><p><b>micah: </b>Didn\u2019t we think that about the primary campaign?</p><p><b>harry: </b>Big difference, Micah, is this &#8230;</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>$$$$$$</p><p><b>harry: </b>You need a unified Republican base to beat Clinton. And right now, Trump clearly doesn\u2019t have that. He\u2019s trailing in almost all the polls. That\u2019s a big difference from the primary, where he led in all the polls. You cannot win a general election with 40 percent of the vote. You have one opponent.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>If Trump only gets 85 percent of the Republican vote, he\u2019s probably screwed. Hell, if he gets only 88 percent, he\u2019s probably screwed, given all his other problems. So even if this stuff is only at the margin, the marginal stuff matters.</p><p><b>harry: </b>And you saw, what I wrote at the top. Clinton is consistently getting more Democrats than Trump is Republicans. Keep in mind, more people identify as Democrats than Republicans in this country.</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>And Ryan would help get people in states where races are tight, etc. to support Trump. He\u2019d give a certain imprimatur to the Trump campaign.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>Yeah. Perhaps the biggest point is that Ryan may signal to other Republicans, especially those running competitive House or Senate races, that it\u2019s OK to distance yourself from Trump.</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>Right, which could kill him.</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>Mobilization. He needs mobilization in a general election. Ryan&#8217;s support isn&#8217;t a necessary or a sufficient condition to get that kind of organization going, but it&#8217;s probably related.</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>Ryan is out to get his, guys! He wants Congress to be powerful and he doesn&#8217;t want to lose those races.</p><p><b>micah: </b>So Ryan is basically sawing off the gangrenous limb?</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>Well, that&#8217;s an interesting question. Is Ryan doing this for the party or for himself?</p><p><b>micah: </b>Both?</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>Probably, and those aren&#8217;t necessarily totally incompatible or distinct.</p><p><b>harry: </b>Ryan is, from all accounts, very loyal to Romney, who is not backing Trump. I think that plays part of it. I genuinely think he disagrees with Trump on the issues. I think he knows about the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-29/straightticket-voting-rises-as-parties-polarize\">increasing relationship between House and presidential results</a>. Ryan is not an idiot.</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>But the gangrenous limb is perhaps more than just Trump. That&#8217;s a bigger undertaking.</p><p><b>micah: </b>Well, that naturally raises the question: Does Trump put Ryan\u2019s speakership in jeopardy? Is the GOP majority in the House in danger?</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>Ryan is in it for himself and Congress \u2026 the \u201chimself\u201d part is also the party. Because he wants to run for president. Have I said that yet? I think that\u2019s big! And he doesn&#8217;t want to run to be the nominee of Trump\u2019s Republican Party.</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>Going back to what I said earlier, I think Ryan wants to refocus the party away from being so responsive to its primary electorate. Trump is perhaps the most extreme version of this but the phenomenon is not limited to him.</p><p><b>natesilver: </b>Right, but Clare\u2019s point is right: Some of this is about Ryan positioning himself \u2014 and the party &#8212; for 2020. It\u2019s very very likely that there\u2019s going to be a competitive Republican primary in 2020 \u2014 certainly if Trump loses and possibly also if he wins. There\u2019s a scenario where Trump loses to Clinton in a near-landslide, and things sorta go back to semi-normal in 2020 and everyone pretends that never happened.</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>Nate, I think that&#8217;s a pretty likely scenario, and in that case the rules won&#8217;t change a whole lot.</p><p><b>micah: </b>OK, so we think Ryan is 1, genuinely concerned about Trump re policy; 2, worried Trump will hurt the GOP electorally; and 3, positioning himself for 2020.</p><p>BTW, the mere act of reading \u201c2020\u201d makes me sick.</p><p><b>harry: </b>Go back to 1998, when the Republicans did the Clinton impeachment, and they lost seats in the House. They turned around in 2000 and went with George W. Bush, who at the time was viewed as moderate and advocate of \u201ccompassionate conservatism.\u201d</p><p><b>micah: </b>Ryan is sort of the anti-Trump. Maybe even a better <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/john-kasich-is-the-anti-trump/\">anti-Trump</a> than Kasich, Clare.</p><p><b>clare.malone: </b>Kasich was a pretty flawed anti-Trump. He was older, used to work for a bank (oof!) and, frankly, wasn\u2019t all that charming. More of an acquired taste on the campaign trail.</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>Yeah, Kasich was like a strong French cheese that eventually made you go &#8220;hmm, that&#8217;s pretty good.&#8221; But not a crowd-pleaser.</p><p><b>harry: </b>The <a href=\"https://electionbettingodds.com/\">betting markets</a> still give Trump a roughly 1 in 4 chance of winning the general election. He probably won\u2019t, but what happens to the party if he does?</p><p><b>julia.azari: </b>That&#8217;s the nightmare scenario for some Republicans: Trump wins. That&#8217;s Andrew Johnson, John Tyler territory. It&#8217;s been awhile, but a president without party ties is a DISASTER.

Since Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/april-26-primaries-presidential-election-2016/\">tore through the Northeast</a> on April 26, the Bernie Sanders campaign has <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/bernie-sanders-staff-lay-off/480255/\">laid off staff</a> and suffered fundraising <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/01/bernie-sanderss-fund-raising-plunges-amid-campaign-woes/\">setbacks</a>. But Sanders has <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-01/bernie-sanders-vows-contested-convention-makes-case-for-superdelegate-flips\">intimated</a> that he will keep fighting, even contesting the Democratic convention in July. So, could Sanders damage Clinton\u2019s chances in the general election? Do long, hard-fought primaries weaken the candidate who emerges from them victorious?</p><p>That question, which is probably even <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-republicans-really-are-in-disarray/\">more pressing for Republicans</a> this year, has preoccupied political scientists for decades. The hypothesis that divisive primaries are detrimental is intuitive: Candidates attack one another, dividing the party and alienating supporters. But research findings have been mixed.</p><p>In a 1998 study of presidential elections, University of New Mexico political scientist Lonna Atkeson<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2991755.pdf?_=1461610051884\"> challenged</a> the theory by suggesting that divisive primaries occur when the party is <i>already</i> divided. In other words, divisive primaries are the symptom, not the disease. We\u2019re in the midst of an open primary, but take recent incumbent presidents as an example: Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992 ran into trouble in the general election, but not because they were challenged in the primaries. They attracted challengers in the primaries because they were already in political trouble. Controlling for factors that account for this political trouble &#8212; the strength of the economy and the president\u2019s popularity &#8212; Atkeson found that the effect of divisive primaries on how well the nominee does in the general election drops out. In other words, divisive primaries don\u2019t make the incumbent party vulnerable; the causation runs the other way.</p><p>The prolonged Democratic primary in 2008 renewed scholarly interest in the divisive primary question, and studies of that contest have produced conflicting results. Henderson, Hillygus and Tompson<a href=\"https://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/74/3/499.full\"> found</a> in a 2010 paper that a Democratic primary voter who was \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the primary was more likely to vote for Republican John McCain in the general election. But they also found that substantive political issues were a bigger factor in voters\u2019 decision-making than primary-inspired angst. Clinton voters who supported the Iraq War, for example, were more likely to vote for McCain in the general. They concluded, as Atkeson did, that the impact of divisive primaries has more to do with different views within the party on political issues than the occurrence of the divisive primary itself.</p><p>In a 2010 paper, Todd Makse and Anand Sokhey looked at Ohio\u2019s <a href=\"http://apr.sagepub.com/content/38/2/233.full.pdf\">Franklin County</a>, chosen because it\u2019s representative of the American public as a whole, and found evidence in precincts that had been favorable to Clinton of \u201cdefection and abstention\u201d in the general election &#8212; voting for McCain or not at all. Amber Wichowsky and Sarah Niebler in a 2010 paper looked at<a href=\"http://apr.sagepub.com/content/38/6/1052.full.pdf\"> tone</a> as well as competitiveness (the closeness of the contest between Obama and Clinton in different areas) and found that negative ads in the primary had little effect on Obama\u2019s performance in the general election.</p><p>You could cherry-pick studies to argue that contentious primary races hurt a nominee, but even those effects are small. There just isn\u2019t a compelling case that competitive primaries damage a nominee\u2019s prospects.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s hard for observational studies to get at exactly what aspects of a \u201cdivisive\u201d primary season might matter. Studies like Atkeson\u2019s focus on<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2991755.pdf?_=1461610051884\"> relative divisiveness</a> &#8212; a comparison of the percentage of the primary vote won by each party\u2019s nominees (from that perspective, the Democrats may be in pretty good shape this year). The studies cited here don\u2019t directly account for the length of the primary season as a driver of outcomes, but a longer primary is a necessary condition for the competition Atkeson identifies and the negative tone that Wichowsky and Niebler identify. And how long a candidate stays in the race, along with how competitive he or she is, still appears to be a primary factor that voters and the media weigh when considering whether a candidate should drop out.</p><p>The conventional wisdom that follows from the (questionable) assumption that competitive primaries are damaging to nominees is that candidates should drop out of the primary early and allow the party to coalesce around the front-runner. For both parties, the norm in effect has apparently been that major competitors should leave the nomination race before the convention &#8212; the earlier the better. These norms may be, as we\u2019ve seen from the political science studies mentioned above, based on incorrect assumptions about how much a divisive contest matters. But the pressure is real nonetheless. We saw it in the 2008 Republican contest when Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/07/romney.campaign/index.html?iref=nextin\">left the race</a> and support consolidated around McCain. Clinton <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/leahy-clinton-should-drop-out/\">was also the recipient</a> of this pressure in the 2008 cycle &#8212; very early on, before she went on to win a number of contests.</p><p>How much will this pressure matter to Sanders? Well, it hasn\u2019t made a difference so far despite Clinton\u2019s lead in delegates, <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/democrats/\">pledged</a> and <a href=\"https://g.co/kgs/2Ro7s\">super</a>. But there are good reasons for Sanders to stay in. For one, he\u2019s still putting victories on the board, including in <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/indiana-primary-presidential-election-2016/\">Indiana on Tuesday</a>. It also appears that the Sanders campaign plans to go to the convention this summer with an agenda for the party <a href=\"http://time.com/4310640/bernie-sanders-convention-democratic-platform-policy-agenda/\">platform</a>, and it\u2019ll have a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/clinton-sanders-democrats-platform-222679\">strong case</a> for why his ideas should carry some weight. And because the evidence isn\u2019t clear that a competitive primary is a hindrance in the general election, it\u2019s hard to defend the argument that Sanders should have stepped aside by now.</p><p>Additionally, fellow <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction\">Mischiefs of Faction</a> writer <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/users/Seth%20Masket\">Seth Masket</a> has noted that ambitious, high-quality candidates tend to<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2015/9/22/9367807/scott-walker-drop-out-early\"> drop out</a> early because they are likely to value their future ambitions within the party. But it\u2019s not clear where Sanders\u2019s relationship with the Democratic Party is going. Sanders, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont, caucuses with the Democrats but has eschewed their label. His candidacy has been about the future of the party, but it\u2019s also been billed as a revolution and a social movement. Will Sanders act like the kind of candidate who wants to run for president again (not likely, given his age), to get on the VP short list or to secure a Cabinet position? For those wondering whether pursuing the Democratic nomination has brought Sanders into the party fold, the path he chooses will be instructive.</p><p>Sanders\u2019s next move will also tell us which side he falls on in the <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2016/4/21/11477782/rethink-party-democracy\">debate</a> that\u2019s <a href=\"https://psmag.com/its-time-to-make-the-case-for-even-stronger-political-parties-8726c6030f6a#.rnd8sjz0u\">raging</a> about how parties should work. If the purpose of parties is to let elites nominate the most ideologically reliable candidate who can unite the party and win in November, then it makes sense for party leaders to eliminate the risk of division. But if there is real value in letting voters &#8212; all primary voters &#8212; have a voice in the party\u2019s decision, then party leaders may want to ride out a long primary season. Because the evidence about the impact of a divisive primary is inconclusive, the stakes of this tradeoff aren\u2019t quite clear.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=114353&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<subtitle>There\u2019s little evidence a prolonged primary hurts a nominee.</subtitle>\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_16126007243874.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_16126007243874.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">APTOPIX DEM 2016 Sanders</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a5ffee70795912de4bc78ad6a72a447a?s=96&#38;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">micahscohen</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Long, Weird Kasich Campaign Gives In To Reality</title>\n\t\t<link>http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-long-weird-kasich-campaign-gives-in-to-reality/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 19:21:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Harry Enten]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016 Election]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016 Republican Primary]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Candidate Obituaries]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[John Kasich]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&#038;p=114324</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Ohio Gov.

John Kasich just announced that he suspending his campaign for president. That Kasich isn&#8217;t going to be president of the United States should shock no one, but that he managed to keep some <i>semblance</i> of a competitive campaign going into May 2016 is a little shocking. The Kasich campaign\u2019s longevity, however, should not distract us from the obvious: Kasich\u2019s performance was relatively weak, and he couldn&#8217;t take advantage of obvious breaks.</p><p>From the start, the most surreal thing about Kasich&#8217;s strategy was that he ran as a moderate despite having a solidly conservative record. When Kasich first entered the race, I <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/john-kasich-a-jeb-bush-in-jon-huntsman-clothing/\">said that he seemed to be running as</a> \u201ca Jeb Bush In Jon Huntsman clothing.\u201d I didn&#8217;t mean it as a compliment. Huntsman, a presidential candidate in 2012, spoke down to the Republican base, and it backfired. Kasich was never quite as condescending as Huntsman, but it&#8217;s clear that he didn&#8217;t have much appeal beyond moderate and liberal Republicans (and even his support among those groups was limited). In the recent Northeast primaries, in which Kasich mostly outperformed Ted Cruz, Kasich ran about even with Cruz among conservative voters, winning no more than 20 percent of self-described conservatives in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/CT/Rep\">Connecticut</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/MD/Rep\">Maryland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/NY/Rep\">New York</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/PA/Rep\">Pennsylvania</a>.</p><p>But let&#8217;s step back for a second: Kasich made it to May. That\u2019s amazing given that he <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/timeline.php?year=2016&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2\">won more than 20 percent of the vote</a> exactly <i>once</i> in the first 20 contests. Most candidates would have seen the writing on the wall and gone home. Kasich didn&#8217;t see the wall or the writing, or he didn\u2019t care. There\u2019s no national primary, but the national polls summarize Kasich\u2019s lack of appeal well:</p><figure id=\"attachment_114329\"class=\"wp-caption aligncenter \"style=\"max-width: 575px\"><a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/national-primary-polls/republican/\"><img class=\"wp-image-114329\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/usa-pollavg-2016-05-04t120856-0400.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"USA-pollavg-2016-05-04t120856-0400\" width=\"575\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/usa-pollavg-2016-05-04t120856-0400.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=575&amp;ssl=1 1x, http://i0.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/usa-pollavg-2016-05-04t120856-0400.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1150&amp;ssl=1 2x\" /></a></figure><p>Kasich continued campaigning until he won Ohio, on March 15. Normally, winning your home state isn\u2019t that impressive, but Kasich used his Buckeye win as justification to go on. In doing so, Kasich became the last mainstream Republican standing. This should have given Kasich a clear opening to consolidate the mainstream Republican vote. His opponents were the very conservative Cruz and the heterodox Donald Trump. Instead, Kasich earned an average of just 19 percent of the vote in the <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/timeline.php?year=2016&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2\">10 caucuses and primaries</a> after <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/15/politics/marco-rubio-drops-out/\">Marco Rubio left the race</a>. Even among moderate and liberal Republicans, which aren\u2019t a huge slice of the GOP pie, Kasich couldn\u2019t win majorities, or even pluralities most of the time.</p><section class=\"viz\"><table

Edison Research Exit Polls</p></footer></section><p>It wasn&#8217;t just voters, though, who decided to pass on Kasich. Kasich, a longtime member of Congress and sitting governor, did relatively poorly in the <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/\">endorsement primary</a>. He ended his campaign with roughly the same number of endorsement points in the FiveThirtyEight endorsement tracker as Trump, who basically wants to do to the Republican Party what <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaVM5mD1lO8\">Anthony Anderson&#8217;s character wanted to do</a> in \u201cHarold and Kumar Go to White Castle.\u201d How did Kasich not line up more elite party support?</p><p>Donors too decided to take a pass on Kasich. According to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/election-2016-campaign-money-race.html\">The New York Times</a>, Kasich and groups supporting him raised a total of $42.1 million. That&#8217;s about equal to the money raised by Scott Walker and his allies, and Walker <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/21/politics/scott-walker-drops-out-2016-election/\">dropped out of the race in September</a>. Kasich raised less money than the following candidates and their allies: Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Cruz, Rubio and Trump. That&#8217;s right &#8212; the famously bargain basement Trump campaign, which relied mostly on free media, raised<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"17\" href=\"#fn-17\"><sup id=\"ss-17\">17</sup></a> and spent more money than Kasich. There was simply no way Kasich could compete with the media magnet Trump while raising less money than him.</p><p>So Kasich didn\u2019t win. He did, however, bring a mostly positive message to the campaign, serving almost as an <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/john-kasich-is-the-anti-trump/\">anti-Trump</a>. Of course, that might be the ultimate irony: Kasich helped Trump win. How? Well, he took up some time in the debates (remember those?) and refused to <a href=\"http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/06/john-kasich-final-pitch-gop-debate-new-hampshire-primary/79912032/\">attack Trump</a>. Kasich <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-would-happen-if-marco-rubio-and-john-kasich-were-one-candidate/\">shared a coalition</a> with Rubio, who likely would have had a better chance of unifying the anti-Trump vote, and probably cost the Florida senator delegates in states like <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/timeline.php?year=2016&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2\">Alabama, South Carolina and Texas</a>. Kasich also almost certainly kept Rubio from <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/va/rep\">winning Virginia</a>. And while Kasich and Cruz had different bases of support, the idea to coordinate the anti-Trump vote strategy turned out to be a disaster. Cruz and Rubio were stronger candidates than Kasich, and Kasich lowered their chances of winning.</p><p>When you put it all together, political observers have to ask themselves: What did we just witness with Kasich? Kasich had a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9, caught a lot of breaks and did very little with those assets. He stayed in the race nearly two months longer than Rubio and <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/\">still earned fewer delegates</a>. I will miss <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/gallery/2016/04/john-kasich-eating-food-photos-002249?slide=0\">Kasich\u2019s eating habits</a>, however.

Still, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/jeb-bush-president-republican-primary-2016/\">other than being early skeptics of Jeb Bush</a>, we basically got the Republican race wrong.</p><p>It\u2019s at this point that I\u2019ll spare you the navel-gazing detours about empirical philosophy<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"19\" href=\"#fn-19\"><sup id=\"ss-19\">19</sup></a> since Trump\u2019s nomination is potentially such a consequential event for both the Republican Party and the Republic. Trump is a huge departure from the conservative movement as embodied by Ronald Reagan &#8212; and also a probable (although by no means certain) general election loser in what would <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clinton-begins-the-2016-campaign-and-its-a-toss-up/\">otherwise be a highly winnable race for Republicans</a>. Usually a party picks a nominee who is both reasonably \u201celectable\u201d and who upholds its traditional policy positions. In Trump, the Republican Party may have a candidate who fails on both counts.</p><p>For a candidate like Trump to win the nomination, it means that several things have gone wrong &#8212; both for the Republican Party and in the assumptions we made about how party nominations work. The other day, I summed up the three most important such factors as follows:</p><div class=\"non-jetpack-embed \"><div class=\"embed-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Updated post-Trump priors:<br />1.

Media is worse than I thought.</p><p>&mdash; Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/726781324254654465\">May 1, 2016</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></div><p>To take the last one first, it\u2019s irresponsible to reflect on Trump\u2019s candidacy without considering the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-donald-trump-hacked-the-media/\">unprecedented way in which he dominated media coverage</a> from the beginning of his campaign, which was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html\">worth the equivalent of $2 billion in paid advertising</a>. Any time a demagogic candidate wins a nomination, it suggests a potential <a href=\"https://storify.com/DemFromCT/brendan-nyhan-on-the-mutifactorial-institutional-f\">failure of political institutions</a>, including (but not limited to) the media. This is something I\u2019ve <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-boom-or-trump-bubble/\">written about a lot</a> from the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-the-worlds-greatest-troll/\">earliest points of the campaign</a>, so we\u2019ll move along for now.</p><p>I\u2019ve also spent a lot of time writing about the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-party-may-be-failing/\">failings of the Republican Party as an institution</a>. To some extent, these problems ought to have been foreseeable, and some <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/maybe-this-time-really-is-different/401900/\">empirically minded scholars like Norman Ornstein foresaw them</a>. The Republican Party had a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-republicans-really-are-in-disarray/\">lot of near-disasters</a> in recent years over matters including the debt ceiling and the selection of a new House speaker; furthermore, it had some <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/eric-cantors-loss-was-like-an-earthquake/\">actual disasters</a> in the form of Senate, House and gubernatorial primaries that left the party with \u201cunelectable\u201d candidates. This raised the likelihood of a disaster in the presidential race as well, and early warning signs included the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/republicans-are-acting-like-democrats-democrats-are-acting-like-republicans/\">unprecedented number of candidates</a> in the race and the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-gop-establishment-blowing-its-anti-trump-campaign/\">lack of strategic coordination</a> to stop Trump.</p><p>Republican voters ultimately did go for Trump, however. In fact, they intervened to wrest control of the nomination back from the delegates. Until just a few weeks ago, Trump\u2019s position had stagnated in <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/national-primary-polls/republican/\">national polls</a> and in <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-new-magic-number-is-40-percent-of-the-vote/\">state-by-state results</a>; before New York on April 19, he\u2019d yet to win a majority in <i>any</i> state, lending credence to the idea that he might have a \u201cceiling\u201d (albeit a higher ceiling than some originally expected) on his support. From New York onward, however, Trump has won a majority in <i>every</i> state, including some, such as Indiana and Maryland, that didn\u2019t seem especially favorable for him demographically. If you plot the share of the vote Trump received in each state on a graph, it resembles a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_function\">step function</a> with a sudden lunge upward after Wisconsin, rather than a smooth upward projection.</p><figure id=\"attachment_114235\"class=\"wp-caption aligncenter \"style=\"max-width: 575px\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-114235\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/silver-postin-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Silver-POSTIN-1\" width=\"575\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"http://i2.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/silver-postin-1.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=575&amp;ssl=1 1x, http://i2.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/silver-postin-1.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1150&amp;ssl=1 2x\" /></figure><p>What happened after Wisconsin? My <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-system-is-rigged-argument-is-working/\">theory</a> as of a couple weeks ago &#8212; and having not gotten so many other things about the Republican race right, I\u2019m sticking to it &#8212; is that Republican voters were swayed by Trump\u2019s arguments that the candidate with the most votes and delegates should be the nominee. (Meanwhile, voters regarded Cruz\u2019s <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-probably-first-ballot-or-bust-for-donald-trump-at-the-gop-convention/\">wins over Trump at state party conventions</a> as undemocratic.) Some voters might have preferred Cruz or John Kasich to Trump in the abstract, but not at the expense of a contested convention in which the plurality winner would be denied the nomination and replaced with <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-voters-kind-of-hate-all-their-choices/\">another flawed candidate</a>.</p><p>But if that explains why Trump had a strong finishing kick and went from getting 35 or 40 percent of the vote to 50+ percent, it doesn\u2019t explain how he got to 35 or 40 percent in the first place.</p><p>To me, the most surprising part of Trump\u2019s nomination &#8212; which is to say, the part I think I got wrongest &#8212; is that Trump won the nomination despite having all types of deviations from conservative orthodoxy. He seemed wobbly on all parts of <a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/diary/westforwestwing2012/2010/12/06/dont-forget-the-third-leg-of-reagans-three-legged-stool/\">Reagan\u2019s three-legged stool</a>: economic policy (he largely opposes free trade and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/11/09/trump.rich/index.html?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS\">once advocated for a wealth tax</a> and single-payer health care), social policy (consider his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/03/donald-trumps-ever-shifting-positions-on-abortion/\">constant flip-flopping over abortion</a>), and foreign policy (he openly <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=iraq+war+republicans+fivethirtyeight&amp;oq=iraq+war+republicans+fivethirtyeight&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6854j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">mocked the Bush administration&#8217;s handling of the Iraq War</a>, which is still fairly popular among Republicans).</p><p>Previous insurgent Republicans, such as the tea party candidates of 2010 and 2012, had run both as \u201canti-establishment\u201d candidates and as more conservative than their rivals. Trump kept the anti-establishment branding, although this was also a selling point for Cruz, who often ran <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/republican/missouri/exit/\">neck-and-neck with Trump</a> among voters who said they felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the Republican Party in exit polls.</p><p>But whereas Cruz offered a mix of anti-establishment-ism and movement conservatism &#8212; and whereas Marco Rubio offered movement conservatism plus a strong claim to electability &#8212; Trump\u2019s main differentiator was doubling down on cultural grievance: grievances against immigrants, against Muslims, against political correctness, against the media, and sometimes against black people and women. And the strategy worked. It\u2019s a point in favor of those who see politics as being governed by cultural identity &#8212; <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/\">a matter of seeking out one\u2019s \u201ctribe\u201d and fitting in with it</a> &#8212; as opposed to carefully calibrating one\u2019s position on a left-right spectrum.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p><em>Listen to the latest episode of the FiveThirtyEight <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/podcasts/\">elections podcast</a>.</em></p><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-114210-9\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%; visibility: hidden;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"\" src=\"https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278&#038;_=9\" /><a href=\"https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278\">https://serve.castfire.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2752198/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-05-12-163138.64k.mp3?ad_params=zones%3DPreroll%2CPreroll2%2CMidroll%2CMidroll2%2CMidroll3%2CMidroll4%2CMidroll5%2CMidroll6%2CPostroll%2CPostroll2%7Cstation_id%3D4278</a></audio><h3>Subscribe: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/fivethirtyeight-elections/id1077418457?mt=2\">iTunes</a> |<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=14554755\">Download</a> |<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/feeds/itunes/podCast?id=14554755\">RSS</a> |<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fivethirtyeight/videos\">Video</a></h3><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p>What\u2019s much harder to say is whether Trump is a one-off &#8212; someone who defied the odds because a lot of things broke in his favor and whose success will be hard to repeat &#8212; or if he signifies a fundamental change in American politics. Trump hasn\u2019t brought success to a wave of tea party candidates in gubernatorial and Senate primaries; in Indiana, in fact, the same voters who elected Trump also gave establishment-friendly U.S. Rep. Todd Young a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/indiana\">67-33 victory</a> in the state\u2019s senatorial primary over the tea-party-aligned Marlin Stutzman. And the Democrats have had a relatively orderly nomination process. Still, it\u2019s hard to imagine that American politics will ever be quite the same after this.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=114210&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_16125071253980.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_16125071253980.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Donald Trump</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ba67d4b1aeec9f6635774b8410a317ad?s=96&#38;d=http%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">nrsilver</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/silver-postin-1.png\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Silver-POSTIN-1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Ted Cruz Stands Down</title>\n\t\t<link>http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ted-cruz-drops-out-2016-campaign-obituary/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 05:13:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Clare Malone]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016 Election]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2016 Republican Primary]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Candidate Obituaries]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ted Cruz]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://fivethirtyeight.com/?post_type=fte_features&#038;p=114216</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Ted Cruz was not going to win the 2016 Republican primary.

Cruz shot to national fame when he <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/25/politics/cruz-how-he-did-it/\">stood</a><span></span> on the floor of the U.S. Senate for more than 20 hours, railed against Obamacare and lingered over the lines of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4FQAov2xI\">Green Eggs and Ham</a><span></span>.\u201d He exited the 2016 race at a time when <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/national-primary-polls/republican/\">national polling averages</a> showed him at 27 percent of the vote, compared to Trump\u2019s 45 percent, and yet he had become the nexus of the #NeverTrump movement.</p><figure id=\"attachment_114191\"class=\"wp-caption aligncenter \"style=\"max-width: 575px\"><a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/national-primary-polls/republican/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-114191\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/usa-pollavg-2016-05-03t170057-04002.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"USA-pollavg-2016-05-03t170057-0400(2)\" width=\"575\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/usa-pollavg-2016-05-03t170057-04002.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=575&amp;ssl=1 1x, http://i1.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/usa-pollavg-2016-05-03t170057-04002.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1150&amp;ssl=1 2x\" /></a></figure><p>Only the day before, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCZwhIgCtD0\">an exchange</a><span></span> with an angry Trump supporter in Indiana, Cruz had seemed defiant, interrogating the man\u2019s belief in Trump. In reply, the Trump acolyte smirked and said, \u201cDo the math. You know, you asked Kasich to drop out; now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d The anonymous Trumpian turned out to be prescient.</p><p>Cruz <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lets-be-serious-about-ted-cruz-from-the-start-hes-too-extreme-and-too-disliked-to-win/\">entered</a><span></span> the race on March 23, 2015, at Liberty University, a venue that signaled the tenor and texture his campaign would take on. The Texas senator and former debater was set on rallying evangelical Christian voters, and his rhetorical stylings &#8212; filled with meaningful pauses and grand turns of phrase &#8212; felt at times not unlike a preacher\u2019s.</p><p>Cruz polled in the single <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/ted-cruz-polls-iowa-new-hampshire-116324\">digits</a> when he entered the race &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/iowa/release-detail?ReleaseID=2158\">5 percent</a> in a February 2015 Quinnipiac poll in Iowa that showed Scott Walker leading the Republican field with 25 percent of the vote. But by the time the Iowa caucuses rolled around, Cruz was polling at <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/iowa-republican/\">about 24 percent</a> in the state. He <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/iowa\">won</a><span></span> the Feb. 1 contest with more than 27 percent of the vote, beating the polls that had showed Trump winning. Cruz\u2019s traditional field operation &#8212; as opposed to the more meager on-the-ground showings of Trump and Marco Rubio &#8212; was credited for turning out Iowa\u2019s famous activist voters.</p><p>But it was a hard struggle for Cruz in the aftermath of Iowa. Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/new-hampshire\">won</a><span></span> New Hampshire &#8212; where Cruz came in third, behind John Kasich &#8212; and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/south-carolina\">South Carolina</a>, a state filled with exactly the kind of evangelicals whom Cruz had hoped to win. That was &#8212; or should have been &#8212; a clear sign that Cruz\u2019s appeal was <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ted-cruz-may-be-too-conservative-to-stop-trump/\">limited</a>. The slew of Super Tuesday primaries on March 1 did nothing to stop the Trump momentum: The businessman <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/2016-03-01\">won</a> seven states to Cruz\u2019s three.</p><p>For a time in the late fall and early winter, Cruz didn\u2019t do much to attack Trump overtly, sticking to his own script of wanting to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/18/ted-cruz-wanted-to-carpet-bomb-the-islamic-state-does-he-understand-todays-military/\">carpet-bomb</a><span></span>\u201d the Islamic State group and stand up for religious liberties. He let other candidates &#8212; including Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina and Lindsey Graham &#8212; talk about the broader damage Trump could do to the Republican Party.</p><p>The Cruz-Trump truce ended in late February, around the time of the South Carolina and Nevada contests. When Rubio dropped out of the race after his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/us/politics/marco-rubio.html\">March 15 loss</a> in Florida, the full force of Trump\u2019s malice turned against Cruz, and the moniker \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d entered the American vernacular, swiftly replacing \u201cLittle Marco.\u201d It was all that Cruz could do to fend off the attacks, even with his deep pockets and superior organizing. In the end, Cruz couldn\u2019t expand his support beyond self-identified \u201cvery conservative\u201d Republican voters.</p><section class=\"viz\"><table class=\"viz full\"

But Trump\u2019s dominance in New York on April 19 and in other Northeast primaries a week later dampened second-ballot delegate talk.

According to recent <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2016/05/cruz-backers/\">polling</a> by Morning Consult, 62 percent of his supporters said they would vote for Trump in a general election against Hillary Clinton, while 13 percent said they would back Clinton and 25 percent weren\u2019t sure what they\u2019d do.</p><p>What more can be said?

At that moment, Donald Trump\u2019s chances of reaching the 1,237 delegates necessary to clinch the Republican nomination seemed no better than 50-50. Now, we\u2019re about to get Indiana results, and it seems like Trump could wrap this thing up if &#8212; as the polls suggest will happen &#8212; he prevails in the Hoosier State. [Check out our Indiana previews, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-guide-to-the-three-possible-outcomes-in-indianas-gop-primary/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/indiana-republican-primary-preview/\">here</a>.] So \u2026 what the hell happened? How did the \u201cStop Trump\u201d movement fall apart so thoroughly in less than 30 days?</p><p><b>harry </b>(<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/harry-enten/\">Harry Enten</a>, senior political writer): I think a few things happened, not the least of which is that Cruz is <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ted-cruz-may-be-too-conservative-to-stop-trump/\">unacceptable to most moderate and liberal voters</a>. That just killed him in the Northeast. And once Trump started putting together 50-plus percent in a number of states, voters decided that they wanted to move on from the primary. There\u2019s obviously more to it than that, but that\u2019s my starting point.</p><p><b>clare.malone </b>(<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/clare-malone/\">Clare Malone</a>, senior political writer): Right, what we have here is a failure to communicate. Cruz\u2019s campaign was always about turning out the base of the Republican Party, activists, etc., who were going to bring on the new era of Reagan. He doubled down on the 1990s/early 2000s cultural conservatism of the GOP instead of making the tent bigger, as a lot of people suggested the party do post-2012. That killed him this year as he tried to become the nexus of #NeverTrump. There was some interesting stuff, for example, in this <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/how-ted-cruz-got-indiana-wrong-213866?paginate=false\">Politico Mag piece</a> about Cruz missing the mark on Indiana\u2019s moderate Republicans in particular.</p><p><b>natesilver </b>(<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/\">Nate Silver</a>, editor in chief): Don\u2019t forget, though, that Trump\u2019s gains in the polls coincided with the period when he started <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-system-is-rigged-argument-is-working/\">pressing the case</a> about the Republican primary system being rigged against him. For many Republicans, it\u2019s no longer a choice between Trump and Cruz, but a choice between Trump and chaos, or Trump and a contested convention.</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: Nate, I think that there\u2019s something to be said there, for sure, but I feel like that \u201cfairness\u201d question was also pretty closely tied to this period of time for whatever reason that Republicans started to sort of wilt and accept that Trump was going to be the nominee. It was the self-fulfilling prophecy of the market.</p><p><b>micah</b>: Yeah, I think the structural things Clare and Harry pointed out were a necessary condition to the fairness argument working.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: The timing is important, though. Trump began moving up in polls in states like California even <i>before</i> New York &#8212; after he was having an awful stretch in Colorado, Wisconsin and whatnot.</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: Sure, Trump didn\u2019t perform well, but I\u2019m not sure voters got that message. I think a lot of this was good marketing on his part, where he never took off the winner\u2019s green jacket. When he wasn\u2019t doing well, he cried foul, cited national polls, polls in upcoming states, and protested the system as rigged.</p><p><b>harry</b>: Often in politics, it\u2019s not just one thing. It\u2019s multiple things. Here\u2019s another explanation: John Kasich\u2019s inability to repeat what were relatively strong performances by Kasich &#8212; or before him, Marco Rubio &#8212; in the Northeast. Something happened there. I don\u2019t know what it was, but look at Kasich\u2019s performance in a state like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/maryland\">Maryland</a> compared to Kasich/Rubio in a state like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/virginia\">Virginia</a>.</p><p><b>micah</b>: Did Cruz need Kasich to do better in the Northeast? What went wrong with the Kasich message?</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: What was ever right with the Kasich message?</p><p><b>micah</b>: Fair point. On paper, though, you would have thought he would do better in the Northeast, right?</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: It was an effete, nuanced message in a year about \u2026 well, let\u2019s just say unsubtle male power. He also had more limited resources: Kasich and his groups raised about <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00009778\">$29,227,421</a>, compared to Cruz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00033085\">$141,868,484</a>.</p><p><b>micah</b>: \u201cUnsubtle Male Power\u201d should be the name of a band.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: Kasich has really only clicked with elite-type voters. The median income for Kasich voters so far in the primaries &#8212; we have an article <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">detailing this calculation</a> &#8212; is $91,000! That\u2019s nuts.</p><p><b>harry</b>: I think that\u2019s an interesting point, Clare. You could make the case that Kasich played with highly informed voters who didn\u2019t need to see a lot of advertising and hated Trump off the bat. Meanwhile, he couldn\u2019t get his message out to moderates who weren\u2019t nearly as knowledgeable about, or tuned in to, politics.</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: Right, I mean, the guy had no national name recognition, but if you were fishing around in the field of 17 for a moderate, you came across him \u2026 or, if you lived in New Hampshire, he cooked you dinner.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: My question is still &#8212; what changed? Kasich and Cruz are both deeply problematic candidates. But they were doing better &#8212; or at least Cruz was &#8212; until about three weeks ago. Trump might get 45 or 50 percent of the vote in Indiana, something he\u2019d have been very unlikely to do earlier in the campaign based on his performance in neighboring states. The numbers he put up in Maryland were way better than what he did in Virginia. The race looked pretty static, and it shifted, in Trump\u2019s favor.</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: It\u2019s people getting more and more used to him! It\u2019s grudging acceptance and a desire to have it all just be over, I think. You saw that in <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-republican-primary-exit-poll-analysis/story?id=38487665\">Northeastern exit polls</a>, with people overwhelmingly saying, regardless of who they voted for, that Trump was going to be their nominee. Further, among Kasich and Cruz supporters, a majority &#8212; 59 percent in preliminary results &#8212; said they would not vote for Trump in November if he\u2019s the party\u2019s nominee, a new high. That result was driven chiefly by rejection of Trump by Kasich voters &#8212; seven in 10 said they wouldn\u2019t back Trump in the fall, as did nearly half of Cruz voters.</p><p><b>micah</b>: So let\u2019s say it\u2019s both. Trump\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d argument had an effect. Cruz is basically a factional candidate who tried to win the nomination through the byzantine party rules. Voters, not surprisingly, aren\u2019t that into that. But voters also got to a point where they were like \u201cthese other candidates had their chance.&#8221;</p><p><b>harry</b>: How about the fact that Hillary Clinton started to look like she was going to win the Democratic primary? That she was going to be the nominee?</p><p><b>micah</b>: The specter of a Clinton presidency is driving GOP voters to rally behind Trump?</p><p><b>harry</b>: I think there\u2019s a feeling that you cannot have a divided party if you want to beat Clinton. Trump is ahead, ergo Trump is the best hope.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: But Cruz and Kasich haven\u2019t done a good job of explaining why it\u2019s worth going to a contested convention to deny Trump the nomination.</p><p><b>harry</b>: Yes. Yes. Yes.</p><p><b>micah</b>: I definitely agree.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: They haven\u2019t made the moral case against him.</p><p><b>micah</b>: Which might be the weirdest part of all this.</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: Was just about to say that. Or they made it TOO LATE, and so it just looked like sore loserness on their parts, not an actual moral stand.</p><p><b>harry</b>: Clinton has made more of a moral case against Trump in the last 24 hours than Cruz and Kasich have, combined, over the past six months.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: Right. The only sympathy I have for Kasich and Cruz on this front is that the media is so Trump-centric that it\u2019s hard for them to drive a message at all.</p><p><b>micah</b>: It doesn\u2019t help that \u2026 how do I say this \u2026 a moral case coming from Cruz tends to sound a bit off-key. Or, as former House Speaker John Boehner would <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/john-beohner-ted-cruz-lucifer-222570\">say</a>, Cruz is \u201cLucifer in the flesh.&#8221; It\u2019s hard for Lucifer to make a moral case.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: But they haven\u2019t really tried. Cruz was buddy-buddy with Trump throughout the first half of the campaign, and Kasich has been Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky throughout.</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: I mean, morality is kind of Cruz&#8217;s wheelhouse &#8212; depending on if you agree with his version of morality.</p><p><b>micah</b>: But Clare, Cruz is also one of the most nakedly ambitious politicos we\u2019ve seen in some time. So his moral case tends to come off as self-serving. (Which it was.)</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: Yes! He is. And that worldly ambition makes a lot of people look askance at him. But if you\u2019re a true believer, a member of that base he wanted to turn out, you think it\u2019s amazing that it\u2019s Ted against the world! Sure, you might wish he were more charming, but things work in mysterious ways.</p><p><b>micah</b>: Very true, but that base isn\u2019t big enough to win the nomination.</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: Right.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: To some extent, I think Cruz lost the forest for the trees. His campaign did a very, very good job of rustling up second-ballot delegates at statewide conventions. But he didn\u2019t really have a plan for what it might look like to deny the guy with the plurality the nomination. It turns out that voters may have made the decision on behalf of the delegates to give the nomination to Trump on the first ballot, instead of making us sit on pins and needles seeing what a few dozen uncommitted delegates would do.</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: It was kind of a crazy plan to begin with, I think.</p><p><b>micah</b>: So let me ask this: If Cruz was a more \u201clikable\u201d politician, if he came off as less self-serving and had made a strong moral case against Trump, could he have better consolidated the anti-Trump vote? Would Kasich voters, for instance, have been more willing to take the bitter Cruz pill in that scenario?</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: If he were Mike Huckabee, you mean? Maybe! Never underestimate the power of personal charm.</p><p><b>micah</b>: Yeah, Huckabee is a good example.</p><p><b>harry</b>: No one even close to Cruz\u2019s ideological bent has come close to winning a Republican presidential nomination in the modern era.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: I\u2019m less sure about that. Cruz had good <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/191264/cruz-image-plummets-trump-improves-among-republicans.aspx?g_source=Opinion&amp;g_medium=lead&amp;g_campaign=tiles\">favorability ratings</a> among Republicans until recently &#8212; better than Trump\u2019s until a couple of weeks ago. I do think, though, that Cruz missed an opportunity to pivot after Rubio dropped out.</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: Yeah, Harry, but we\u2019re not talking about a normal primary &#8212; we\u2019re talking about 2016. If Cruz had a less off-putting demeanor, I think there\u2019s a chance he could be doing better \u2026 or if his image was more Paul Ryan-esque; not necessarily charming, but earnest.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: But Cruz never really made the case &#8212; and this is a part of the moral case for #NeverTrump &#8212; that he was the guy to unite the party. Instead, his closing message in Indiana is about \u2026 how Trump is too liberal on the transgender bathroom law in North Carolina? An obscure issue that has the Republican governor in North Carolina potentially in a lot of re-election trouble?</p><p><b>harry</b>: With the exception of Wisconsin, Cruz never won the moderate/liberal vote in any state with an entrance/exit poll. And I think there are many reasons to believe that Wisconsin might been unique. Here\u2019s a thought: Cruz\u2019s message was really a ball of nothing. Sometimes it was Trump wasn\u2019t a conservative. Sometimes it was Trump was nasty. I got lost in it all. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if voters did too.</p><p><b>clare.malone</b>: I just don&#8217;t think he has that in his DNA; he\u2019s a strategist, a debater, a counter puncher (like Trump!) Cruz was drafting off Trump for so long. It\u2019s an odd, discordant thing &#8212; he\u2019s a guy who\u2019s all about social mores in his politics &#8212; but he was late to make the moral stand (as we have said over and over).

Trump had a larger base and the \u201cswing\u201d voters decided that Trump wasn\u2019t so much worse than Cruz to not rally around him.</p><p><b>natesilver</b>: A somewhat broader point is that the primary process, and particularly the Republican primary process, is designed to help the front-runner. That\u2019s why it was kind of amazing that Trump was only treading water for so long.

There are elements of truth in this perspective: Republican voters, especially Trump supporters, are unhappy about the direction of the economy. Trump voters have lower incomes than supporters of John Kasich or Marco Rubio. And things have gone so badly for the Republican \u201cestablishment\u201d that the party may be <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-party-may-be-failing/\">facing an existential crisis</a>.</p><p>But the definition of \u201cworking class\u201d and similar terms is fuzzy, and narratives like these risk obscuring an important and perhaps counterintuitive fact about Trump\u2019s voters: As compared with most Americans, Trump\u2019s voters are better off. The median household income of a Trump voter so far in the primaries is about $72,000, based on estimates derived from exit polls and Census Bureau data. That\u2019s lower than the $91,000 median for Kasich voters. But it\u2019s well above the national median household income of about $56,000. It\u2019s also higher than the median income for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters, which is around $61,000 for both.</p><p>These figures, as I mentioned, are derived from <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/republican/virginia/exit/\">exit polls</a>, which so far have been conducted in 23 primary states.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"20\" href=\"#fn-20\"><sup id=\"ss-20\">20</sup></a> The exit polls have <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/election-results-data/2016-Primaries/pdf/VA_R_1.pdf\">asked voters</a> to describe their 2015 family income by using one of five broad categories, ranging from \u201cunder $30,000\u201d to \u201c$200,000 or more.\u201d It\u2019s fairly straightforward to interpolate a median income for voters of each candidate from this data; for instance, we can infer that the median Clinton voter in Wisconsin made about $63,000.<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"21\" href=\"#fn-21\"><sup id=\"ss-21\">21</sup></a> You can

(as in New Hampshire or Missouri) but sometimes substantially. In Florida, for instance, the median household income for Trump voters was about $70,000, compared with $48,000 for the state as a whole. The differences are usually larger in states with substantial non-white populations, as black and Hispanic voters are overwhelmingly Democratic and tend to have lower incomes. In South Carolina, for example, the median Trump supporter had a household income of $72,000, while the median for Clinton supporters was $39,000.</p><p>Ted Cruz voters have a similar median income to Trump supporters &#8212; about $73,000. Kasich\u2019s supporters have a very high median income, $91,000, and it has exceeded $100,000 in several states. Rubio\u2019s voters, not displayed in the table above, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marco-rubio-never-had-a-base/\">followed a similar pattern</a> to Kasich voters, with a median income of $88,000.</p><p>Many of the differences reflect that Republican voters are wealthier overall than Democratic ones, and also that wealthier Americans are more likely to turn out to vote, especially in the primaries. However, while Republican turnout has considerably increased overall from four years ago, there\u2019s no sign of a particularly heavy turnout among \u201cworking-class\u201d or lower-income Republicans. On average in states where exit polls were conducted both this year and in the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/primaries/epolls/wi/\">Republican campaign four years ago</a>, 29 percent of GOP voters have had household incomes below $50,000 this year, compared with 31 percent in 2012.</p><section class=\"viz half\"><table class=\"viz full\" data-carpenter-slug=\"silver.income.3\"><thead><tr><th class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\" colspan=\"1\">STATE</th><th class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\">2012</th><th class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\">2016</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Alabama</td><td class=\"number\">37%</td><td class=\"number\">41%</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Florida</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">34</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">33</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Georgia</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">24</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">26</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Illinois</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">28</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">23</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Maryland</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">19</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">19</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Massachusetts</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">24</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">20</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Michigan</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">35</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">37</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Mississippi</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">36</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">37</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">New Hampshire</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">26</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">27</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Ohio</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">32</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">30</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Oklahoma</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">41</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">30</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">South Carolina</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">36</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">27</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Tennessee</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">35</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">33</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Vermont</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">37</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">30</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;\">Virginia</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">25</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">19</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text\" style=\"width:45%;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:black;\">Wisconsin</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:black;\">32</td><td class=\"number\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:black;\">28</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text bold\" style=\"width:45%;\">Average</td><td class=\"number bold\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">31</td><td class=\"number bold\" style=\"padding-right:1.1em;\">29</td></tr></tbody><caption>Share of Republican electorate with household income below $50,000</caption></table><footer class=\"viz\"><p class=\"source\">Source: EDISON RESEARCH EXIT POLLS</p></footer></section><p>The median income for Clinton and Sanders voters &#8212; $61,000 for each candidate &#8212; is generally much closer to the overall median income in each state. But even Democratic turnout tends to skew slightly toward a wealthier electorate, somewhat validating Sanders\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/bernie-sanders-poor-people-don-t-vote-s-just-fact-n561051\">claim</a> that \u201cpoor people don\u2019t vote.\u201d I estimate that 27 percent of American households had incomes under $30,000 last year. By comparison, 20 percent of Clinton voters did, as did 18 percent of Sanders supporters. (Those figures imply Clinton might have a bigger edge on Sanders if more poor people voted, although it would depend on whether they were black, white or Hispanic.) Both Democratic candidates do better than the Republicans in this category, however. Only 12 percent of Trump voters have incomes below $30,000; when you also consider that Clinton has <a href=\"http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/D\">more votes than Trump overall</a>, that means about twice as many low-income voters have cast a ballot for Clinton than for Trump so far this year.</p><section class=\"viz\"><table class=\"viz full\"

other respects. Since almost all of Trump\u2019s voters so far in the primaries have been non-Hispanic whites, we can ask whether they make lower incomes than other white Americans, for instance. The answer is \u201cno.\u201d The median household income for non-Hispanic whites is about $62,000,<a class=\"footnote-link\" data-expandable=\"entry-footnotes\" data-footnote-id=\"23\" href=\"#fn-23\"><sup id=\"ss-23\">23</sup></a> still a fair bit lower than the $72,000 median for Trump voters.</p><p>Likewise, although about 44 percent of Trump supporters have college degrees, according to exit polls &#8212; lower than the 50 percent for Cruz supporters or 64 percent for Kasich supporters &#8212; that\u2019s still higher than the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/2014/tables.html\">33 percent of non-Hispanic white adults</a>, or the 29 percent of American adults overall, who have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree.</p><p>This is not to say that Trump voters are happy about the condition of the economy. Substantial majorities of Republicans in every state so far have said they\u2019re \u201cvery worried\u201d about the condition of the U.S. economy, according to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jSQLibxGhHnHNP7o_hJtth1YXY2idhMJ8Jg2SF0emBw/edit#gid=0\">exit polls</a>, and these voters have been more likely to vote for Trump. But that anxiety doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect their personal economic circumstances, which for many Trump voters, at least in a relative sense, are reasonably good.</p><p><strong>Check out our <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/indiana-primary-presidential-election-2016/\">live coverage of the Indiana primary elections</a>.</strong></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=114030&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<subtitle>His voters are better off economically compared with most Americans.</subtitle>\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/trumpclass-1.jpg?w=150\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/trumpclass-1.jpg?w=150\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">GOP 2016 Trump</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ba67d4b1aeec9f6635774b8410a317ad?s=96&#38;d=http%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">nrsilver</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>",
