And <a href=\"http://weteachstartup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WeTeachStartup</a>, a new initiative launched by entrepreneur Qasim Virjee, is the latest event giving entrepreneurs a crash course on evolving their startup idea. </p>\n<p>Between May 27 and 28, WeTeachStartup is hosting a jam-packed weekend in Toronto featuring keynotes, workshops, and panel discussions with guests from Real Ventures and HIGHLINE. During the weekend, attendees will learn the basics of launching their company, including sources of finance, business modelling and validation, the entrepreneurial journey, and the best ways to pitch. </p>\n<p>Virjee, who has 20 years of experience as an entrepreneur commercializing internet-based technologies and advising at least 300 startups, founded the program based on his experience. Virjee also ran IBM&#8217;s Entrepreneur Program in Canada for the past few years. &#8220;I founded WeTeachStartup to distill knowledge and methods for early stage startup success from my experience and that of my global network to create programming and tools which empower anyone who wants to translate an idea into a venture,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our two-day bootcamp gives people a uniquely high touch deep dive into tech entrepreneurialism plus connects them with inspiring first hand stories from the trenches.&#8221; Virjee hopes to expand the bootcamp to other cities across Canada. </p>\n<p>The bootcamp is accepting 75 entrepreneurs, while at least 150 startup founders, CTOs, and venture capitalists will attend the exclusive networking event.

He showed up at TechToronto to talk about the evolution of the entrepreneur \u2013 which includes idea, prototype, product, company, and business. &#8220;I&#8217;ve yet to meet a single person that, when he or she started the company, possesses the skills that I talk about,&#8221; Lau said, alluding to writing the code, designing and building the product, and figuring out finances. </p>\n<p>While being focused on their product and trying to secure funding, entrepreneurs all of sudden find that they also have to become good managers and strong leaders for their team. Entrepreneurship can be glamorous, but it&#8217;s also a challenging, lifelong learning experience. &#8220;The best product that you want to build is not necessarily the product, the best product you want to build is yourself,&#8221; Lau said.</p>\n<p>Watch Lau&#8217;s talk below:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pEmHxKmrmM8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/wattpad-ceo-allen-lau-says-the-best-product-entrepreneurs-can-build-is-themselves/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Win a spot on a private jet with 500 Startups&#8217; Dave McClure, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/win-a-spot-on-a-private-jet-with-500-startups-dave-mcclure-reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/win-a-spot-on-a-private-jet-with-500-startups-dave-mcclure-reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:30:11 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Launches]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[events]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Montreal]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65500</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Startupfest isn&#8217;t just looking to host an event featuring tech heavyweight speakers Re/code executive editor Kara Swisher and O&#8217;Reilly Media founder Tim O&#8217;Reilly \u2014...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Startupfest isn&#8217;t just looking to host an event featuring tech heavyweight speakers Re/code executive editor Kara Swisher and O&#8217;Reilly Media founder Tim O&#8217;Reilly \u2014 they also want to give one startup a chance to sit on a private jet with them. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://startupfestival.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Startupfest</a> is launching a contest to give one startup a seat on a private jet flying in from Silicon Valley to Startupfest.

Vancouver-based <a href=\"http://www.wealthbar.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wealthbar</a>, which provides online investment portfolios and financial planning services, has raised $5.5 million in funding to improve the client experience with Wealthbar&#8217;s team of financial experts. The funding was led by Nicola Wealth Management, one of Canada&#8217;s biggest high-net-worth wealth management company with $3 billion in assets under management, and Howard Atkinson, an ETF industry pioneer and former President of Horizon ETFs.</p>\n<p>Wealthbar&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Tea Nicola, said that the company is looking to provide a more personalized client experience. &#8220;Many Canadians are not financially &#8216;fit&#8217; &#8211; so much like a personal trainer or dietitian, with the right tools, data, and our own financial experts we want to help clients develop positive financial habits,&#8221; said Nicola. &#8220;Our clients already get personalized online financial planning with a WealthBar financial advisor. In the near future, we want to take this even further and enable our clients to collaborate with advisors in even more useful ways including ongoing and proactive financial coaching. </p>\n<p>Nicola says that while chat bots represent an exciting trend, the traditional finance industry is generally slow to take advantage of emerging technologies \u2014 and, in general, clients aren&#8217;t ready to embrace AI and machine learning right now. Instead, chat bots should be leveraged to support human interactions. &#8220;Human advisors provide a sense of comfort and trust, and frankly they bring personality to what we do. Clients enjoy having real conversations,&#8221; said Nicola. </p>\n<p>And this approach seems to be paying off \u2014 the company has been growing 25 percent month over month, as more customers become turned off from high investment fees from banks, and learn about FinTech startups working in this space. </p>\n<p>&#8220;In the near future, we can see chat bots acting as personal assistants for advisors, answering basic questions, scheduling appointments, collecting information, and generally helping by making the best use of an advisor&#8217;s time. Eventually, we could even see them being used for some financial coaching interactions. They could provide friendly interactive reminders to improve financial fitness, make suggestions around spending and savings habits, and coach intelligently based on user data.&#8221;</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/wealthbar-raises-5-5-million-to-build-on-its-personalized-client-experience/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Toronto taxi companies decide against using surge pricing</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/toronto-taxi-companies-decide-against-using-surge-pricing/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/toronto-taxi-companies-decide-against-using-surge-pricing/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:00:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Igor Bonifacic]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65492</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Torontonians won\u2019t have to consider surge pricing the next time they hail a taxi cab using a mobile app. In a press release sent...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Torontonians won\u2019t have to consider surge pricing the next time they hail a taxi cab using a mobile app.</p>\n<p>In a press release sent out earlier today, the Toronto Taxi Alliance (TTA) said its members have decided against adopting the practice. The group, which represents the city\u2019s taxi companies, counts all of Toronto\u2019s major brokerages, including Beck Taxi, City Taxi, Co-Op Tax and Diamond Taxi, among its members.</p>\n<p>Surge pricing, the practice of raising the cost of a fare during periods of high demand, has been Uber\u2019s calling card for the past couple of years. The San Francisco-based company has been criticized for sticking to the practice during periods of <a href=\"http://www.blogto.com/city/2013/07/uber_feels_the_heat_after_jacking_up_prices_during_storm/\" target=\"_blank\">inclement weather</a> and <a href=\"http://www.blogto.com/city/2016/03/uber_draws_ire_for_surge_pricing_during_ttc_mess/\" target=\"_blank\">public transit outages</a>. On May 3rd, when the City of Toronto passed its new ride-sharing bylaw, allowing Uber to legally operate in the city, it also made it legal for taxi companies to take advantage of surge pricing through their mobile apps.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe that surge pricing has no place in superior customer service, and is not an activity engaged in by professionals \u2013 especially not professional drivers responsible for the safety of vulnerable passengers,\u201d said Rita Smith, the executive director of the TTA.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe that a young woman heading home with $20 in her wallet should be confident that a cab ride which cost $15 on Tuesday will still cost $15 on Saturday, not $30, $45 or $90,\u201d Smith added.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/11/torontos-taxi-brokerages-say-they-wont-use-surge-pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/toronto-taxi-companies-decide-against-using-surge-pricing/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Talentful might be the solution to the tech sector\u2019s biggest gripe: hiring talent</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/talentful-might-be-the-solution-to-the-tech-sectors-biggest-gripe-hiring-talent/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/talentful-might-be-the-solution-to-the-tech-sectors-biggest-gripe-hiring-talent/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:09:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jonathon Narvey]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65466</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The perennial question of how Canada\u2019s startup sector can hire and retain the tech talent it needs is bound to have multiple answers. One...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>The perennial question of <a href=\"http://betakit.com/bkchats-how-can-startups-keep-great-talent/\">how Canada\u2019s startup sector</a> can hire and retain the tech talent it needs is bound to have multiple answers. One solution has recently launched out of Vancouver, where the <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/vancouver-tech-scene/article25885653/\">tech talent crunch</a> sometimes seems particularly acute. <a href=\"https://www.talentful.io/\">Talentful</a> (with the slogan, \u201chiring developers shouldn\u2019t be so damn hard!\u201d splashed on its homepage) leverages machine learning and data science to hook up companies with the coders they need to make the next wunder-widget. It\u2019s already making a huge dent in the time and budget companies need to find those people, working with local innovators like BuildDirect.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe way we\u2019ve done recruiting of software developers has to be disrupted,\u201d explains founder Jia Chen, whose company has gotten real traction in the last two months, ever since pivoting from a different business model. \u201cThe current process takes too long, costs too much and consumes too much labor. Just going through individual LinkedIn profiles can often take hours out of a recruiter\u2019s day.\u201d Their technology connects data points from Github, Meetup, and Twitter to give employers and recruiters insights they couldn\u2019t get from the usual sources. This is a change from relying on sites like LinkedIn to mine data, which is what many recruiting efforts involve.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The basic recruiting process hasn\u2019t changed much in a century, where the employer and employee are not on the same level.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cLinkedIn\u2019s biggest problem today is the top developers don\u2019t want to be contacted,\u201d Chen says. \u201cThey get tons of spam from recruiters\u201d so they may actually not post relevant data about their expertise to keep off recruiters\u2019 radar. \u201cAlso, the profiles include user-contributed content that may not actually represent the person\u2019s strengths. We have data showing this person is actually good at things like writing code, or doing Javascript.\u201d</p>\n<p>Talentful is able to extrapolate data from multiple online sources, so companies can get a more holistic view of the candidate, even if that person has taken steps to make their online presence stealthy. Tweets about coding may show a person\u2019s passion for particular technology, while comments on online forums where coders show off their own innovations by adding to a community can provide a real sense of whether the coder really knows their stuff.</p>\n<p>The method gets results: chopping the time to shortlist candidates from 14 days to half a second and lowering the cost of a talent search from thousands to mere hundreds of dollars. \u201cToday, the average recruiting cost is 10 percent of that person\u2019s first year salary in the tech industry, by just doing it on your own through advertising,&#8221; said Chen. &#8220;The industry average for using a recruiting agency is 18 percent to 36 percent of their first year salary \u2013 and in contrast, our flat fee is $250 per month. With that, they can have up to 50 searches \u2013 more than enough to identify developers because they can typically find them within just the first few searches.\u201d</p>\n<p>That opens up the potential to truly disrupt the recruitment industry, as Chen aims to do \u2013 but the hiring revolution won\u2019t happen in a day, he explains. The biggest hurdle is just changing people\u2019s mindsets. The basic recruiting process hasn\u2019t changed much in a century, where the employer and employee are not on the same level. This is changing the process so it\u2019s more like matching \u2014 and with data, you\u2019re able to make a more informed decision. It\u2019s about convincing recruiting managers to use as much data as possible to spend as much time with the candidate before hiring to make a good match.\u201d Instead of putting most of the time into just finding a pool of candidates, recruiters can take the time to truly get to know a potential hire \u2013 and hopefully get better results in retaining that tech talent, not just matching it up with employers in the first place.</p>\n<p>It may not be the whole solution to the tech talent crunch \u2013 but in a world full of mismatched candidates and companies, Talentful is already working to make it happen.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/talentful-might-be-the-solution-to-the-tech-sectors-biggest-gripe-hiring-talent/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Slack debuts Sign in with Slack feature emulating Facebook, Twitter logins</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/slack-debuts-sign-in-with-slack-feature-emulating-facebook-twitter-logins/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/slack-debuts-sign-in-with-slack-feature-emulating-facebook-twitter-logins/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 19:43:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Launches]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65453</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Slack is officially moving into the enterprise space with the launch of its &#8220;Sign in with Slack&#8221; feature, which will enable users to sign...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Slack is officially moving into the enterprise space with the launch of its &#8220;Sign in with Slack&#8221; feature, which will enable users to sign up for apps outside of Slack using their Slack identity.

It&#8217;s the largest regional event for angel investors in Canada. </p>\n<p>The event&#8217;s goal is to bring together angel investors based in Western Canada for a full day of discussions, insights, and networking. Yuri Navarro, CEO of NACO Canada, said the event is a response to  investor requests for more networking opportunities like those offered at NACO&#8217;s annual national event \u2014 but with a more localized focus. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Our investors get the most value from building relationships locally and regionally,&#8221; said Navarro. \u201cOur mission is to grow and professionalize the Canadian Angel investor ecosystem so they can focus on providing their network, knowledge, and investment capital to growing innovative Canadian companies.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Speakers at the event include Hern\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez, managing partner at Angel Ventures Mexico; Pieter Dorsman, CEO of Redpeaks Management; and Marie Savostianik executive director of the Saskatchewan Capital Network.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With Alberta&#8217;s economy undergoing one of the most tumultuous periods in the Province&#8217;s history, we thought it was important to bring the expertise and capital of our Western Angel investor community to Calgary,&#8221; said Navarro. &#8220;We want to help fill the gaps in the regional innovation funding continuum and ensure Alberta&#8217;s best companies have the ability to continue growing locally.&#8221; </p>\n<p>For tickets to the event, check out the event page <a href=\"http://www.nacocanada.com/naco-western-regional-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/naco-hosting-inaugural-western-regional-summit-for-angel-investors-on-may-24/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Revlo launches with $1.12 million seed round from Y Combinator, Extreme Venture Partners</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/revlo-launches-with-1-12-million-seed-round-from-y-combinator-extreme-venture-partners/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/revlo-launches-with-1-12-million-seed-round-from-y-combinator-extreme-venture-partners/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 15:13:44 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Funding]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[funding]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65436</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Revlo has officially launched its fan engagement platform on Twitch thanks to a $1.12 million seed round from Y Combinator and Extreme Venture Partners....]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Revlo has officially launched its fan engagement platform on Twitch thanks to a $1.12 million seed round from Y Combinator and Extreme Venture Partners. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.revlo.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Revlo</a>&#8216;s platform capitalizes on Twitch&#8217;s global video streaming platform, which currently has 45 million gamers broadcasting on the site every month. With Revlo, Twitch broadcasters can provide a free virtual currency customized to their fanbase, which fans can use for personalized rewards. Justin Kan, founder of Twitch, will be Revlo&#8217;s group leader at Y Combinator.  </p>\n<p>While in beta Revlo helped 15,000 broadcasters interact with an audience of more than 5 million unique viewers per month.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to create meaningful one-on-one interactions for thousands of people when you are only one person,\u201d said James Sun, Revlo Co-founder and CEO.  As a lifelong gamer, I wanted to help broadcasters create fun, personal experiences for their loyal fanbase. Happy fans spend more time and money in their favorite communities \u2014 helping the streamer and ultimately, growing the industry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viewers are rewarded for engagement and interactions ranging from time spent watching the channel to actively participating in contests and games unique to each community. Fans can spend their earned currency for experiences like a personal invitation to join the next viewer game.

Organizations like Ladies Learning Code are helping to teach Canadians, in particular young women, the necessary skills to succeed and become passionate builders of technology,\u201d said the Hon. Kirsty Duncan, the Minister of Science in a statement.</p>\n<p>The tour kicked off in Toronto on May 1, and picked up again on May 8 in Ottawa&#8217;s\u00a0Parliament Hill to mark Science Odyssey Week. Duncan went on to say that with this program, Ladies Learning Code also hopes to empower youth to become innovators in the Canadian technology space.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese types of hands-on experiences with technology transform the way youth engage with computer science and lay the foundation for future pathways to discovery and innovation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Code:mobile will bring an interactive technology curriculum through 22 Canadian cities from May to September 2016 in partnership with Microsoft Canada through its YouthSpark Initiative. Included in these stops are several indigenous and low-income\u00a0neighbourhoods that likely wouldn&#8217;t have access to these services otherwise.</p>\n<p>According to Ladies Learning Code\u2019s Co-Executive Director Laura Plant, this latest event is part of the group\u2019s larger goal to \u201cinspire the next generation of technologists.\u201d</p>\n<p>She goes on to say that since the group\u2019s founding in 2011, <a href=\"http://ladieslearningcode.com/\">Ladies Learning Code</a> has held over 600 workshops and events and reached over 24,000.</p>\n<p>At the time of its launch, its founding members announced its goal of teaching 200,000 Canadian women and youth to code by 2020.

Where larger companies may have to deal with legacy software and siloed departments, startups can be nimble with small teams and a willingness to pivot heir product early on. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that these large corporations are channelling this spirit with their own incubators; recently, Cisco announced the opening of its <a href=\"http://betakit.com/cisco-opens-toronto-innovation-centre-to-jumpstart-fintech-healthcare-and-smart-city-initiatives/\" target=\"_blank\">own innovation centre</a>, while institutions like Tangerine seem to be announcing <a href=\"http://betakit.com/td-and-flybits-announce-exclusive-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">partnerships</a> and <a href=\"http://betakit.com/tangerine-and-ryerson-university-partner-to-open-incubator-in-toronto/\" target=\"_blank\">incubators</a> almost every week. </p>\n<p>Johnson &#038; Johnson, the world\u2019s sixth largest consumer company, has been working to maintain innovation in its company in this way for years. Through J &#038; J Innovation, which focuses on collaborations between J &#038; J\u2019s global businesses and entrepreneurs, the company announced the opening of the first Canadian location of JLABS, the company\u2019s life sciences incubator model. JLABS has set up shop in Toronto, where it boasts 40,000 square feet of space within the MaRS Discovery District. </p>\n<p>\u201cToronto has this microcosm of the entire healthcare system within a block. For us it\u2019s to be right in the middle of this condensed set of resources was an opportunity for us because we feel that we can add something to this system,\u201d said Melinda Richter, head of JLABS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0041-2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0041-2-1024x685.jpg\" alt=\"jlabs\" width=\"690\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-65411\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jlabs.jnjinnovation.com/locations/jlabs-toronto\" target=\"_blank\">JLABS @ Toronto</a> provides shared lab space and offices, modular lab suites and access to scientific, industry, and capital funding experts within the space, and accommodates up to 50 startups. Currently, the incubator houses 22 startups.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I looked at the difference between commercializing between health and tech, it was dramatically different. In the tech industry you give a couple of people some computers and a thousand dollars, a few years later they can turn around and sell it to Microsoft or Google for $200 million,\u201d said Richter. \u201cIn the life science industry, to get started you need at least a year, if not more, to raise money, get your infrastructure running, buy your equipment, get your experts in place; and even then it takes at least eight to 12 years and billions of dollars to get a drug to market.\u201d</p>\n<p>Last year, the company announced that it was building the space in part with <a href=\"http://betakit.com/jlabs-incubator-opening-in-mars-spring-2016-with-19-4-million-in-government-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">$19.4 million in government support</a>. The layout of the space is an odd mix between the the stereotypical hospital setting and tech incubator \u2014 sanitary with fresh white walls and complete with scientific lab testing materials, yet balanced out with the colourful furniture and open concept workspaces that\u2019s become quintessential to the ideal coworking space. One could still smell the fresh paint walking through the incubator, which overlooks the space\u2019s official partners like Queen\u2019s Park, the University of Toronto, and CAMH, which are visible visible through the many windows. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0054-1024x685.jpg\" alt=\"jlabs\" width=\"690\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-65409\" /></p>\n<p>Through JLABS, which provides an in-house operations team, Richter said that life sciences companies can spend less time thinking about the logistics of running a business, and more time accelerating their research and ensuring the products they want to bring to market are both safe and functional. </p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the things we want to do in all of our facilities is democratize where you are, so you\u2019re never a lab rat stuck in a dingy, dark room. In every lab, as you go through, you can see through to the outside. Everyone has an equal access to a great environment,\u201d said Richter.</p>\n<p>JLABS features a device and digital prototype lab that provides entrepreneurs access to highly specialized tools, as well as skill-building programs to design and develop smart health technologies. While J&#038;J does not fund the startups, Ricther said that the space features an in-house deal team that evaluates whether startups can benefit from funding or partnering with J&#038;J to reach global markets. </p>\n<p>Companies at JLABS also have the opportunity to collaborate with IBM Canada to access its entrepreneurship programs and services, including IBM Watson, its cognitive business technology, and IBM\u2019s Bluemix cloud-based development platform.

Significantly, in the instances of cards from CIBC and RBC, Apple Pay now supports both credit and Interac debit cards from those two banks.</p>\n<p>Support for Bank of Montreal, TD Canada Trust and Scotiabank debit and credit cards will be added in the coming months, according to an Apple spokesperson. This means Apple and all five major Canadian banks have come to terms. PC Mobile, whose \u201cpersonal banking services are provided by the direct banking division of CIBC,\u201d does not yet support Apple Pay and according to an Apple Canada representative, there is \u201cno timing on that being added yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sometime in June, all five major banks will also start to allow their customers to use their cards and Apple Pay to pay for physical goods within apps.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> While TD Canada Trust declined to provide a specific launch date for Apple Pay support, the financial institution said \u201cwe mean weeks away\u201d in an email sent to MobileSyrup.</p>\n<p>Teri Currie, Group Head, Canadian Personal Banking and TD Bank Group, said, \u201cWe are excited to share that Apple Pay is coming soon to TD.

Now, they also have to worry about startups getting ahead in the next generation of FinTech: bitcoin exchanges.</p>\n<p>Coinsquare, one of the pitches on <em>The Disruptors</em>, is one such bitcoin exchange. Coinsquare allows users to go online and trade bitcoin with currencies like the Canadian dollar; users can also purchase gold and silver stored within the exchange. The platform works like a brokerage account at a bank, with access to full order books and market-to-market reporting. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The platform is easy to use for a non-trader by using instant coin-to-coin conversion where you can instantly convert all your coins with the click of a mouse,&#8221; said Virgile Rostand, founder of <a href=\"https://coinsquare.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Coinsquare</a>. &#8220;With cryptocurrencies, you can send money anywhere in the world for a few cents and in a few seconds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Co-host Bruce Croxon said that the amount of people using this will be key to making this platform successful. &#8220;The problem with bitcoin so far, is the massive fluctuation in the value. Which I think is partly why they introduced the gold hedge,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I&#8217;m going to exchange something, I want to know what the thing is going to be worth the day after I do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch the whole pitch below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=863756&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a production partner on <a href=\"http://betakit.com/category/the-disruptors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Disruptors</a>.

This year&#8217;s theme for the program is called <em>Capital Matters: Human. Financial. Social</em>.

Kelowna, B.C.-based <a href=\"https://www.freshgrade.com/\">FreshGrade</a> has already gotten plenty of traction \u2013 it\u2019s used by more than one million teachers, parents and students worldwide, and with a new round of $11.6 million in funding, it may be on the verge of schooling the competition. To date, FreshGrade has raised $15.9 million.</p>\n<p>FreshGrade lets teachers and students &#8220;capture learning artifacts from the classroom&#8221; by uploading pictures, videos, audio recordings, and notes to an online portfolio. Teachers also have the ability to map learning objectives to assessments and activities, making it easier to see where some students may be falling behind, so they can resolve their learning issues faster.</p>\n<p>The Series A round is roughly ten times the previous level of investment in the startup and is even more startling, given the somewhat more challenging investment ecosystem in the last few months. Still, there\u2019s no question the firm had legs right from the start, co-founded by Lane Merrifield (co-founder of Club Penguin, sold to Disney for $350 million) and Steve Wandler (whose YourTechOnline.com startup was acquired by SupportSoft, Inc., which went on to dominate the online tech support space).</p>\n<p>FreshGrade was founded in 2011, but the company spent a lot of time in a pre-build phase and didn\u2019t even have a working app until more recently, notes FreshGrade director of marketing Kemp Edmonds, looking back with some wonder on the pace of change. \u201cThe current iteration that combines a digital portfolio, parent engagement, with a nice assessment component for educators, has been around for 18 months.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just as the education startup has rapidly evolved, the sector itself is also changing, even faster. \u201cEdTech 1.0 was built for administrators and IT teams, often with too many features, requiring a lot of operational people. It was a beast to manage,\u201d Edmonds explains. \u201cThe spreadsheet systems that were a big part of it were not really for helping teachers, but it was more about facilitating administrators, doing reporting better and not necessarily engaging with students in a better way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today \u2013 and the emphasis is much more well-rounded. \u201cEdTech 2.0 is more about the people,\u201d Edmonds says. \u201cFor instance, parent engagement in the old world was centred around a report card, parent-teacher interview, and maybe participation in a field trip. You\u2019d log into a gateway to see what your child was doing, but you don\u2019t really see what they\u2019re learning.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s where FreshGrade aims to shake things up, with personalized learning that truly connects all stakeholders \u2013 ideally, without making teachers take up any extra time. \u201cThat\u2019s actually something we\u2019ve heard directly from one teacher \u2013 they thought this was going to take a long time, but it\u2019s actually more efficient to use this system instead of sending notes home with students.\u201d</p>\n<p>That change is also changing your typical after-school conversation. For any parent who has struggled to get a word out of their taciturn children around the dinner table, now they\u2019ve already seen the kid\u2019s classroom presentation or seen their book report \u2013 and something real to spark a discussion. \u201cThere are success stories here that are so heartening, like the father who said to us, \u2018You gave me my daughter back\u2019. He works two shifts a day and doesn\u2019t really get to see her \u2013 and this is how they can keep in touch.\u201d</p>\n<p>That improved involvement by parents is bound to improve learning outcomes, Kemp explains. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole movement going on and we\u2019re just a part of it. I\u2019ve seen it happen in so many sectors, where technology really creates positive change.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/freshgrade-raises-11-6-million-series-a-for-personalized-education-platform/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>#smallrooms podcast: Andrew Peek on Shopify acquisitions and too much funding</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/smallrooms-podcast-andrew-peek-on-shopify-acquisitions-and-too-much-funding/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/smallrooms-podcast-andrew-peek-on-shopify-acquisitions-and-too-much-funding/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 13:16:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Rob Kenedi]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65250</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Rob Kenedi sits down with Andrew Peek, founder of Pilot, a note-taking startup scooped up alongside Jet Cooper when it was acquired by Shopify,...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Rob Kenedi sits down with Andrew Peek, founder of Pilot, a note-taking startup scooped up alongside Jet Cooper when it was acquired by Shopify, who describes his strategy to start his next company.

Coinkite lets users deposit bitcoin currency in a USB device \u2014 called <a href=\"https://opendime.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenDime</a> \u2014 that can simply be handed to its recipient. OpenDime&#8217;s private key is generated inside the device and is not known to any human \u2014 not even the owner. In the future, the company sees anyone who needs to transact digital money in-person using the platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You are able to trust that the value is in that device just like a verified cheque. Whoever holds the verified cheque is the owner of the value,&#8221; said Rodolfo Novak, co-founder of Coinkite. &#8220;It enables you to use Bitcoin physically, just like cash.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Co-host Amber Kanwar said that the existence of a device like this acknowledges that, while we live in a digital-first world, there is still value in hardware. &#8220;There&#8217;s still a physical world where people go out and buy things. Just because you bought into a digital currency, it doesn&#8217;t mean you should be shut out of that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch the whole pitch below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=863757&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a production partner on <a href=\"http://betakit.com/category/the-disruptors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Disruptors</a>.

With speeches, panels, and policy hackathons scattered in between sessions, the overall goal was to define specifically what works and what doesn\u2019t when it comes to fostering strong Canadian companies. </p>\n<p>The morning kicked off with Globalive founder and chairman Tony Lacavera, who touched on both the issues affecting entrepreneurs that politicians should consider, and what startups can do to make their voices heard on the global stage. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe system is complicated for a reason. You guys deal with business tensions, and we get that, but we\u2019re trying to encourage job creation. &#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Like Thalmic Labs CEO Stephen Lake <a href=\"http://betakit.com/thalmics-stephen-lake-challenges-federal-government-to-better-define-canadas-innovation-agenda/\" target=\"_blank\">has said in the past</a>, the government needs to increase its support of companies in the tech sector, where most of the world\u2019s jobs will be. \u201cI would encourage governments to err on the side of supporting the job creators of tomorrow\u2014the Canadian small businesses and startups\u2014as opposed to mature companies, companies with the means to succeed on their own or those in declining or obsolete industries.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the same time, Lacavera pointed out that the onus was also on our home-grown VCs and funders to build the foundation for an ecosystem friendly to first-time Canadian entrepreneurs. \u201cWe need to embrace failure, for ourselves and for the people we invest in. I believe that if you haven\u2019t failed once, you haven\u2019t learned enough. Failing builds character and resilience, and it prepares us for what\u2019s ahead,\u201d said Lacavera. \u201cYet too many in the VC industry shy away from people who didn\u2019t succeed the first time. This needs to change.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Intuit Canada is proud to have been apart of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StartupDay?src=hash\">#StartupDay</a> on the Hill!

As it can take months to bring in foreign workers to Canada, these highly-skilled workers often end up choosing other offers. Lau said that the current system was designed for the industrial economy to protect Canadian jobs, but doesn\u2019t work in the new information economy. \u201cIn the new information economy, it doesn\u2019t work this way. Because we don\u2019t worry about protecting our jobs in the same way \u2014 we want to disrupt our own jobs so we can advance our company,\u201d said Lau. \u201cThe thinking is very different. For those leaders that we could bring in, they can build a hundred amazing companies here and those amazing companies can attract thousands of people.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sitting on a panel with Lau, Arif Virani, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Immigration, Refugees &#038; Citizenship, said that he understood the perspective of entrepreneurs. However, entrepreneurs also needed to understand that the government is accountable to the larger Canadian population. \u201cThe system is complicated for a reason. You guys deal with business tensions, and we get that, and we\u2019re trying to encourage business and job creation. But we deal with a reality that we want growth and that we are accountable to that growth to the Canadian public,\u201d said Virani. \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re saying that if it was easier to hire a Canadian you would just to do that, but from our perspective we need to be assured that the effort to hire Canadians is done at the outset.\u201d </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/allenlau\">@allenlau</a> saying there are lots of skills that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wattpad\">@wattpad</a> can&#39;t train employees for.

It\u2019s an area that\u2019s in line with the Canadian government\u2019s vision, as part of the federal budget includes <a href=\"http://betakit.com/innovation-minister-navdeep-bains-reveals-commitment-to-cleantech-and-holistic-approach-post-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">$130 million over five years to cleantech ventures</a>. </p>\n<p>\u201cUltimately, when we\u2019re looking at how to position the global brand for Canada, we are increasingly becoming leaders in social entrepreneurship. But what does that mean? For me, it means focusing on what kind of enterprises we want to create,\u201d said Surman. \u201cWhat is the vision that we have for Canada, and how can harness the power of entrepreneurship and market forces and use those forces to solve pressing challenges? How do we bring solutions to community? My vision of our Canada is not just creating jobs but creating meaningful work.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/startupday-brings-startups-and-govt-together-to-shape-canadas-innovation-strategy/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Vancouver Tech Podcast Ep. 25: Softchoice</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/vancouver-tech-podcast-ep-25-softchoice/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/vancouver-tech-podcast-ep-25-softchoice/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 17:32:08 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[James Doyle]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[dev]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65318</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Drew and James open with a brief chat about the week in review, a little bit about Microsoft naming, as well as some of...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Drew and James open with a brief chat about the week in review, a little bit about Microsoft naming, as well as some of the side projects they are working on.</p>\n<p>The guest this week is Matt Carolan from <a href=\"http://www.softchoice.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Softchoice</a>, an experienced group that offers deep expertise for the design and implementation of advanced IT and cloud solutions.</p>\n<p>Matt has been a part of the Vancouver tech community for quite a while now.

Going further, what if it could observe\u00a0patterns within the home and tell if a loved one was\u00a0having a stroke; or give your doctor access through an app,\u00a0to allow better informed medical decisions?\u00a0For TELUS&#8217; chief dreamer and founder of the TELUS Innovation Lab program, <a href=\"http://blog.telus.com/community/connected-mom/\">Allen Devine</a>, this was the challenge as he looked to technology to provide comfort and assistance for his own mother. Ultimately, new data-driven technology helped her get the assistance she needed quickly, improving her quality of life. That experience drives him to work with others to build innovation that helps real human beings. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are no limitations, anyone can participate and post ideas onto this virtual world.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Devine\u00a0spoke about his experience recently\u00a0at TELUS Garden in downtown Vancouver.\u00a0He aims to make this\u00a0kind of big data innovation a\u00a0reality, by\u00a0connecting startups, policy makers, and business executives to reach the bigger picture. Their online forum launches later this year, but they&#8217;re already reaching out to entrepreneurs and innovators who want to get involved.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we wanted to do was create a facility where startups, universities, and major corporations can all work together on ideas and bring them to fruition,&#8221;\u00a0Devine says. \u201cNormally, accelerators help startups in their day-to-day operations and financing and do a great job at it. What we wanted to do was go up a layer and work on the political burdens that are going to be impacting them. So rather than taking the company and giving them a place to work out of everyday and giving them venture capital, we decided to look at it from a different angle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Essentially, the Innovation Lab is a response to high demand from a ready marketplace. \u201cWhen we first put the question out there to existing accelerators, and said &#8216;Okay guys, this is what we were thinking, what do you think?&#8217; they went and checked with all 54 of their startups.\u201d</p>\n<p>The result is a\u00a0process that starts online, with an online forum where entrepreneurs, developers, and any interested individuals can post an idea and share ideas.\u00a0\u201cWe wanted to create a community, so we are creating an online portal where everybody can post ideas, and virtually the community can start to comment on it,&#8221; said Devine. &#8220;Others can post what works with that idea, what doesn\u2019t work, and who they know that can volunteer to support that idea. So there are no limitations, anyone can participate and post ideas onto this virtual world. From there the top ideas will funnel up into the facility in the hopes of becoming a reality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once ideas enter the incubator they are broken down into three phases: mock-up, proof of concept and finally a bootcamp to get them to market. \u201cOur goal is to link ideas and start ups to achieve a bigger goal, so come at any point. We may not be able to use an idea right away, but at some point we will come back and link you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>To become involved with Devine\u00a0and the TELUS Innovation Lab, individuals and companies are encouraged to connect with him on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allen-devine-3a62581\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Linkedin</span></a>. \u201cMy job is to take people outside to see a utopian world that they wouldn\u2019t have access to, where everyone works and talks together, turning dreams into reality.&#8221;</span></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/telus-idea-incubator-opens-to-help-startups-dream-big/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>#ProductHuntTO returns on May 26 with health care focus</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/producthuntto-returns-on-may-26-with-health-care-focus/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/producthuntto-returns-on-may-26-with-health-care-focus/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 15:05:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Event Recaps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[events]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65279</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[From exploring how Canadian companies lead the FinTech global stage, to examining how the slow-to-innovate real estate industry can benefit from evolving tech, Product...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>From exploring how Canadian companies <a href=\"http://betakit.com/producthuntto-tackles-startup-survival-in-highly-regulated-fintech-industry/\" target=\"_blank\">lead the FinTech global stage</a>, to examining how the slow-to-innovate <a href=\"http://betakit.com/producthuntto-closes-year-with-real-estate-focus/\" target=\"_blank\">real estate industry</a> can benefit from evolving tech, Product Hunt Toronto consistently delivers on what&#8217;s hot in Canadian tech.

The other 48 percent of business owners polled report that they have no interest in implementing the technology.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s just conflicting priorities and mandates,&#8221; says Pam Ferguson, GM of IoT solution sales and strategic investments at Telus, &#8220;Businesses are so strapped for time, it&#8217;s hard to align on those priorities.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIf they started with one solution, they\u2019re adding a second.

So much so that most have begun to further their network of IoT devices.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;If they started with one solution, they\u2019re adding a second.

Don and Alex Tapscott are the father and son co-authors of <em>The Blockchain Revolution</em>, an upcoming book that examines the ripple effects of blockchain in the world market.</p>\n<p>The Tapscotts say that today&#8217;s biggest disruptors, like Uber and Airbnb, could be in trouble in the world of blockchain. &#8220;You can go to your app, and rather than Uber, it&#8217;s like super Uber,&#8221; said Don. &#8220;If you want a car, you would say where you want to go, and it says it will be there in three minutes. But there will be no company running all of this. It&#8217;s just a distributed software application running on this blockchain. There&#8217;s no reason to have a $65 billion company running this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Instead, these kinds of services can be completely run by &#8220;clever code&#8221;, and the people who actually create the value get to keep the value. The latter point is the most important for the Tapscotts, who say that blockchain could be key to addressing social and economic inequality. &#8220;The only way to solve that problem is to redistribute wealth. The government says they&#8217;ll tax the rich, but what if we pre-distribute wealth and change how wealth gets created in the first place,&#8221; Don said. &#8220;We can democratize the creation of prosperity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch the whole interview below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=863759&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/the-blockchain-revolution-authors-say-blockchain-is-key-to-addressing-inequality-on-thedisruptors/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>L-SPARK accepting applications from B2B SaaS startups for third cohort</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/l-spark-accepting-applications-from-b2b-saas-startups-for-third-cohort/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/l-spark-accepting-applications-from-b2b-saas-startups-for-third-cohort/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 18:24:01 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[incubator]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ottawa]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65238</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Canada&#8217;s only B2B SaaS accelerator, L-SPARK, is accepting applications for its third cohort.

The program supports startups preparing for Series A financing in nine months. </p>\n<p>L-SPARK companies work one-on-one with a mentor, who is embedded for two days a week within one company while helping them execute on a nine-month plan. Mentors assist L-SPARK companies with business fundamentals and create new growth opportunities, while the companies leverage L-SPARK&#8217;s corporate partners and investor pitch sessions. Partners with the accelerator include Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, OpenText, Shopify, Citrix, and Mitel.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re getting a C-level executive working for your company. You&#8217;re never going to get more value than having someone with those resources and that much pedigree and knowledge,\u201d said <a href=\"https://careerjsm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CareerJSM</a> co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Doucet, who recently pitched on stage at <a href=\"http://betakit.com/ottawa-based-careerjsm-launches-at-worlds-biggest-startup-festival/\" target=\"_blank\">the world&#8217;s biggest startup festival</a>.</p>\n<p>Weekly &#8220;scrums&#8221; are held with the L-SPARK team of directors to assess progress and how founders can reach both immediate objectives and overarching goals. L-SPARK&#8217;s business development team also prepares startups for late seed or Series A investment by facilitating guided meetings with early stage angel, venture capital, and institutional investors. Past success stories coming out of L-SPARK include <a href=\"https://thebettersoftwarecompany.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Better Software Company</a>, which has raised an aggregate total of $3.7 million in funding with New York-based ff Venture Capital leading their seed round. </p>\n<p>Up to six startups will be selected for the accelerator program, and L-SPARK is looking for entrepreneurs with a commercial product and at least $10,000 to $30,000 in monthly recurring revenue.

The sold-out event featured speakers with experience across diverse stages of starting a business, from scaling lean and embracing failure, to understanding where investors are putting their money and why. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;The strongest tribe is a group of people focused on building the success of the people around them&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AccelerateOTT?src=hash\">#AccelerateOTT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iqMaB95W9R\">pic.twitter.com/iqMaB95W9R</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Jamie Keeley (@nutkeeley) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nutkeeley/status/728255343948488704\">May 5, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>500 Startups\u2019 Selcuk Atli, a 500 Startups venture partner and serial entrepreneur, touched down in Ottawa to speak on how to successfully pivot a business. \u201cSometimes you need to change your technology. Your solution will probably be the same, but you will probably change your technology multiple times in your product,\u201d he said. He gave the example of Facebook, which invested heavily in HTML5 as it looked to get into mobile, only to realize mobile web is slow native mobile apps were a better investment. \u201cThey changed the technology but kept the product the same, with the goal of retaining users.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he says that even successful entrepreneurs make the mistake of not pivoting efficiently; taking a walk with one of his entrepreneur friends, Atli heard how his friend had an idea to build a messaging app for professional people; without knowing what kind of professional people he was targeting, he was starting with the product. \u201cAlways start with the customer problem.

He sees data as a resource, and analytics as the techniques. \u201cOnly make the investment if you know the questions that you have and problems that you need to solve for your business right now, because this is very expensive and you wanna do it knowing that you have specific problems to solve.\u201d</p>\n<p>As with most conversations at Canadian tech events, the chat eventually took a turn towards the best places in Canada to build a business. L\u00fctke, who started Shopify ten years ago, said it\u2019s been gratifying to see grassroots tech communities, especially in Ottawa come together for events like #AccelerateOTT. \u201cI think Ottawa is one of the best places in the world to build a business because we\u2019re so long-term focused and we always have been,\u201d L\u00fctke said, alluding to the fact that much of the tech that makes up the foundation of the internet \u2014 like routers and switches \u2014 were built in Canada&#8217;s capital. \u201cThe best way to build companies is to bring people together and say we\u2019re going to aim for the stars, and we\u2019re going to create something really ambitious. That\u2019s not really going to happen tomorrow, we need to take our time and stick together as a group.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/accelerateott-brings-community-together-to-learn-how-to-build-better-businesses/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Fonolo CEO Shai Berger on whether chat or messaging will dominate B2C communication</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/fonolo-ceo-shai-berger-on-whether-chat-or-messaging-will-dominate-b2c-communication/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/fonolo-ceo-shai-berger-on-whether-chat-or-messaging-will-dominate-b2c-communication/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 14:29:57 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Event Recaps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65168</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Between companies like Facebook announcing its dedication to bots and Shopify announcing that it acquired a social marketing bot, it seems like chat is...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Between companies like Facebook announcing its dedication to bots and Shopify announcing that it <a href=\"http://betakit.com/shopify-acquires-san-francisco-based-virtual-marketing-assistant-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired a social marketing bot</a>, it seems like chat is the next frontier of customer service.</p>\n<p>But as <a href=\"https://fonolo.com/\">Fonolo</a> CEO Shai Berger pointed out at TechToronto, it&#8217;s still unclear whether chat via channels like SMS or instant messaging, like Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp, were more suited for business-to-customer communication. &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s with our family on SMS, friends on Facebook messenger, at work with Slack, we love this &#8216;I type something, you type something&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Berger said that when it came to business to customer communication, chat&#8217;s biggest problem was that it wasn&#8217;t as successful in the mobile context, besides embedding a chat feature in a company app. Messenger, on the other hand, has an advantage as most people don&#8217;t like adding apps of individual companies. &#8220;With chat, I hire a chat company and I add them to my website. It&#8217;s like adding a widget and my brand is still dominant,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But when you use Facebook, the brand of that platform is still very dominant. When you use chat, you close the browser window, the history is gone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said that the fact that messenger conversations are more &#8220;permanent&#8221; will become a bigger conversation in the future, as companies have a permanent record of how you interact with them. </p>\n<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m the company and I bring in a chat provider, I own the channel but I&#8217;m paying them, so that&#8217;s all that matters. If I use Facebook, they have an agenda too \u2014 they&#8217;re offering this for free, and it&#8217;s not a charity,&#8221; Berger said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sharing a communication channel with other businesses, and with Facebook&#8217;s agenda.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch the whole talk below:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UgVaL9KRBz8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Get your tickets for TechToronto&#8217;s May 9 meetup \u2014 and afterparty \u2014 at RBC Waterpark Place <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/TechTorontoOrg/events/228024264/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a><br />\n</em>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/fonolo-ceo-shai-berger-on-whether-chat-or-messaging-will-dominate-b2c-communication/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Tingle removes the awkwardness from dating apps using anonymous audio chats</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/tingle-removes-the-friction-from-dating-apps-using-anonymous-audio-chats/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/tingle-removes-the-friction-from-dating-apps-using-anonymous-audio-chats/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 22:06:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jonathon Narvey]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[mobile]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65209</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Dating can be a risky business.

It\u2019s about putting yourself out there \u2013 which has always made it a challenge for dating apps to protect your privacy. Some apps let you filter out who can message you \u2013 but once you\u2019ve taken the plunge and actually clicked on someone you think might be a match, just from their photo and dating profile, your privacy is typically jettisoned. You pick a caf\u00e9 to meet in person after a few texts, or give them your number to talk with them \u2013 but now you\u2019re potentially opening yourself up to an awkward time with someone who doesn\u2019t really match their profile picture, or whose charming profile is benevolently described as false advertising. Not so with the <a href=\"https://tingle.com/\">Tingle</a> app, developed by a team in Vancouver, that has a simple but elegant solution to help users avoid a bad date while matching you with someone who might actually be a great fit: you can actually talk to the person, through the app, instead of on the phone.</p>\n<p>The app is available both on iOS and Android. Founder Ian Andrew Bell is betting that the app\u2019s security features give it a leg up over the entrenched competition in the digital dating world, taking down \u201cbarriers to intimacy and providing greater chances for real connections,\u201d he says. It has hundreds of thousands of users in cities across Canada and the UK, and has recently launched in the USA. \u201cTingle\u2019s platform integrates secure, anonymous, live audio and video chats between matches, allowing users to see and hear each other in real-time. If the match doesn\u2019t work, both users can disengage without fear of social reprisal as no personal, identifying details like a user\u2019s telephone number, are shared.\u201d You can talk directly to your potential date, while mitigating the risk of a bad experience.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It boils down to this: people are crazy! And on top of that, a phone call is a very intimate thing. It\u2019s hard to fake who you are.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That focus on privacy and security that seems so essential is Tingle\u2019s big differentiator \u2013 and Bell thinks the competition that hasn\u2019t installed these features yet is going to keep lagging into the future. \u201cLook at the Tinder guys, for instance. They\u2019ve got a big technical team, but they\u2019ve had a lot of CEO churn. Never underestimate the organizational incompetence of a big company. I\u2019m honestly surprised to see the lack of innovation there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He acknowledges that the competition is quite fierce in this space, with a fair number of dating apps. \u201cBut it\u2019s about reputation. Most of these dating sites are really just spreadsheet acquire and churn business models, spending X to acquire a customer for Z number of months \u2013 and there\u2019s nothing special about them. There used to be an app called White Label Dating \u2013 you\u2019d be astonished at how many dating sites are based off that.\u201d To scale up, Tingle had to build a reputation people could trust \u2013 so that\u2019s been their focus from the start.</p>\n<p>Bell knows from personal experience how hard it can be to meet the right person through online dating, having endured 300 first dates before finding his wife. It was then that he realized the online dating system was broken, and an opportunity ripe for picking.</p>\n<p>To this day, he\u2019s haunted by the personal experience of a nightmare dating scenario that his app is meant to short-circuit. \u201cI met this one date at a restaurant and she kept drinking from a coke bottle in her purse that had booze in it,\u201d Bell says. \u201cShe was drunk by dinner. I walked her home and her boyfriend was orbiting us around the block in his Porsche. She literally couldn\u2019t get the key in the door \u2013 I grabbed the key, pushed her in the door, closed the door and ran away. Then she called me for years, in front of my wife! That\u2019s why I can channel the needs of women\u201d who want to meet people through an app \u2014 safely.</p>\n<p>Of course, before they launched, Bell did plenty of research to test the market \u2013 and found that if anything, his own experience was tame. \u201cWay back in 2010, we talked to 334 women online and in person, started with a survey, which progressed to large scale interviews, and that progressed to understanding all the things I\u2019d heard about,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;It boils down to this: people are crazy! And on top of that, a phone call is a very intimate thing. It\u2019s hard to fake who you are. You\u2019re pretty naked, personality-wise. If you get to the phone call earlier in the process, you get to find out who they really are sooner.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/tingle-removes-the-friction-from-dating-apps-using-anonymous-audio-chats/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Report: Female entrepreneurs struggle to get funding due to perception they are more &#8216;risk-averse&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/report-female-entrepreneurs-struggle-to-get-funding-due-to-perception-they-are-more-risk-averse/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/report-female-entrepreneurs-struggle-to-get-funding-due-to-perception-they-are-more-risk-averse/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 19:55:12 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Funding]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[report]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65091</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A report released Carleton University, BMO Financial Group, and The Beacon Agency suggests that the perception that women are less willing to take risks...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>A report released Carleton University, BMO Financial Group, and The Beacon Agency suggests that the perception that women are less willing to take risks than men is hampering their ability to receive funding. </p>\n<p>The report includes two years of research reviewing reports on women&#8217;s entrepreneurship in Canada and<br />\nthe USA, as well as interviews with 100 female entrepreneurs. It detailed several barriers to women securing funding for their businesses, including both the perception that they are more risk-averse, and a lack of awareness surrounding funding options available to them. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Existing literature and studies place too much emphasis on taking risk as the ultimate goal,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;Such overemphasis on risk mainly stems from the tendency to frame it with an outcome-oriented vocabulary such as \u2018take\u2019 risk, \u2018avoid\u2019 risk, and \u2018averse\u2019 risk, which leads many people to intentionally<br />\nor unintentionally focus more on the outcome of female and male entrepreneur\u2019s risk-taking behaviour.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The report said that female entrepreneurs tend to perceive risk both in terms of economic and social value \u2014 such as hiring the right person or the impact a decision will have on their business&#8217; reputation \u2014 which differs from traditional approaches that consider risk mainly from an economic point of view.</p>\n<p>When women do receive funding, they are more likely to make decisions related to risk necessary to pursue their entrepreneurial intentions \u2014 however, the very issue of limited access to funding prevents women from taking these risks to expand and develop their companies. </p>\n<p>In one study cited by the report, women-owned businesses were less likely to seek equity financing than male-owned businesses, but when they did, they were just as likely to receive equity financing as men. In contrast, when it came to accessing external debt-equity financing, the proportion of venture capital investments in women-led businesses was small. Companies with male CEOs attracted more external financing than companies with female CEOs;  companies with female CEOs only received 3 percent of total venture capital funding amount to US $1.5 billion, compared to the total of US $50.8 billion invested during the period of 2011-2013.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Despite the evidence that female enterprises are increasing in number, financial institutions and investors have not fully understood or supported their resource needs to start and grow their businesses,&#8221; the report said, naming support from professional networks, business forums, and access to mentors as key to influencing a female entrepreneur&#8217;s decision to start and expand businesses. &#8220;Such social sources of support can provide access to information that helps entrepreneurs to recognize opportunities for new venture creations and business growth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To access the full report, check it out <a href=\"https://bmoforwomen.bmo.com/wp-content/uploads/BMO_CARLETON_WOMEN_REPORT.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/report-female-entrepreneurs-struggle-to-get-funding-due-to-perception-they-are-more-risk-averse/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Waterloo-based Knowledgehook wins Google&#8217;s Game Changer Award</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/waterloo-based-knowledgehook-wins-googles-game-changer-award/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/waterloo-based-knowledgehook-wins-googles-game-changer-award/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 18:19:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kitchener-Waterloo]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65187</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[At a young age, Travis Ratnam felt that the intelligence of his father skipped a generation.

When Ratnam\u2019s father was 13, he taught himself math and became so good at it that he started tutoring people in his town \u2014 including the math teachers\u2019 children. In contrast, at a young age, Ratnam found out he was one of the poorest performing students in his class. </p>\n<p>Luckily, as his father had experience teaching math after all those years, Ratnam was able to go from being at the bottom of his class to receiving the Governor General Academic Medal in high school. \u201cI thought at that point, maybe I\u2019m not stupid. It took a while, but that left an impression,\u201d Ratnam said. \u201cI had the conviction that if I could do this, there is a pathway for most kids to achieve what I achieved.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since that experience, Ratnam has been dedicated to helping students learn more effectively starting at the source: teachers. Ratnam is the co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.knowledgehook.com/Index/\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledgehook</a>, a Waterloo-based software company that analyzes the academic performance of math students in real time. Using the gamified platform, teachers get access to questions designed to fit their curriculum that all students can participate in from a web-enabled device. The platform is meant to be interactive as students can see how the entire class answered. </p>\n<p>While a lot of technology today is focused on automating tasks, possible at the expense of human jobs, Knowledgehook instead focuses on building on the skills of teachers already in the school system. Rather than relying solely on technology to teach children more effectively, Ratnam said that it leverages technology to help teachers figure out why students are struggling; with Knowledgehook, the approach isn\u2019t just to understand that a student is struggling to calculate the area of a square, but why. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Travis_KH-1024x935.jpg\" alt=\"knowledgehook\" width=\"690\" height=\"630\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-64109\" /></p>\n<p>Interestingly, this isn\u2019t Ratnam\u2019s first experience with creating a means for effectively communicating; Ratnam met his co-founder, Lambo Jayapalan, when they were working on a nonprofit in Sri Lanka and Indonesia that helped other nonprofits assess logistical challenges in affected areas. Their nonprofit allowed students to use calling cards to get feedback from citizens, who then generated reports that they passed on to not for profits and governments. The reports helped evaluate what pressing needs affected certain regions.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we built the first version of Knowledgehook, I was helping kids with gamification and educational supports, and breaking down the supports into smaller bite-sized goals that were more achievable for kids. We did notice that there were things that teachers could do in the classroom,\u201d Ratnam said. \u201cSchool boards are spending a lot of money investing in training teachers to do a specific thing that tech couldn\u2019t quite do as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s likely that the young Ratnam wouldn\u2019t believe where he is today; his business has grown from working out of Communitech\u2019s Rev and participating in the Accelerator Centres\u2019 AC JumpStart programs, to being one of two Canadian startups <a href=\"http://betakit.com/canadian-startups-pacta-and-knowledgehook-to-pitch-at-google-demo-day/\" target=\"_blank\">to make it to Google Demo Day</a>, where the team pitched in front of investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. Knowledgehook ended up receiving Google\u2019s Game Changer Award.</p>\n<p>Since September 2015, 12 Ontario school boards have been reviewing the insights that Knowledgehook provides and how it helps teachers adapt their lessons. \u201cThat aspect perhaps is reminiscent of that human learning experience I had with my dad,\u201d Ratnam said. </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/waterloo-based-knowledgehook-wins-googles-game-changer-award/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Metabridge announces 15 startups to pitch to Silicon Valley investors at lakeside retreat</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/metabridge-announces-15-startups-to-pitch-to-silicon-valley-investors-at-lakeside-retreat/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/metabridge-announces-15-startups-to-pitch-to-silicon-valley-investors-at-lakeside-retreat/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:15:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Event Recaps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kelowna]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65183</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Metabridge is back for another year of taking the idea of the uptight tech conference and flipping that on its head.

The nonprofit organization, a part of Accelerate Okanagan, announced the 15 startups that will have the chance to connect with investors and mentors from Silicon Valley at a lakeside retreat in Kelowna, BC. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We take our group outside of the conference room and put them in settings that allow for creative and collaborative thinking and dialogue. Our VIPs from the Silicon Valley are not only getting content from a curated group of companies, they are also being pitched to in a highly memorable setting,&#8221; said Sehra Bremner, Executive Director of<a href=\"http://www.metabridge.ca/\" target=\"_blank\"> Metabridge</a>. &#8220;This combination leads to a higher propensity for that VIP to engage with the founders post event. Through experiential programming, we aim to disengage the VIP from their office so they are 100 percent focused on our startups, leading to that one conversation that could change the trajectory of that company.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The startups come from all across Canada and include one company from Kenya, which will be the first international startup to take part in the event. Teams will meet with VCs and serial entrepreneurs from companies such as Google, AngelList and OMERS Ventures, with the goal of pursuing investment opportunities, strategic partnerships, and mentorship.</p>\n<p>The list includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<a href=\"https://www.brightsquid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brightsquid</a> (Alberta)<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.chalk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chalk</a> (Ontario)<br />\n<a href=\"https://communitysift.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Communitysift</a> (British Columbia)<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.dive-networks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dive</a> (Ontario)<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.earnwithdrop.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Drop Loyalty Inc.</a> (Ontario)<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flytographer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flytographer</a> (British Columbia)<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.lynk.co.ke/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynk Jobs Ltd.</a> (Kenya)<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.nobal.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Nobal Technologies</a> (Alberta)<br />\n<a href=\"https://openchannel.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Channel</a> (Ontario)<br />\n<a href=\"https://rentmoola.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RentMoola</a> (British Columbia)<br />\n<a href=\"http://ringpartner.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RingPartner Inc.</a> (British Columbia)<br />\n<a href=\"http://silkstart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SilkStart</a> (British Columbia)<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.talentclick.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TalentClick</a> (British Columbia)<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.tapplock.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tapplock</a> (Ontario)<br />\n<a href=\"https://getturnstyle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Turnstyle</a> (Ontario)\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;We had an overwhelming response to Metabridge this year. 109 companies applied, which is more than ever before. We are really pleased with the strength of all the companies that took the time to apply,&#8221; said Bremner.</p>\n<p>Metabridge has seen companies like MediaCore, SqueezeCMM, and Hurrier pitch at its event. The retreat is open to startups in the late seed and early Series A stage that have a product on the market and demonstrated traction.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/metabridge-announces-15-startups-to-pitch-to-silicon-valley-investors-at-lakeside-retreat/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>CanCon Podcast Ep. 15: Let&#8217;s talk startups and mental health</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/cancon-podcast-ep-15-lets-talk-startups-and-mental-health/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/cancon-podcast-ep-15-lets-talk-startups-and-mental-health/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 15:19:03 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Douglas Soltys]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[impact]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65166</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[72% of entrepreneurs report being affected by mental health conditions, and a third of them claim to be affected by two or more issues....]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>72% of entrepreneurs report being affected by mental health conditions, and a third of them claim to be affected by two or more issues.

This number does not count the billion Messenger users or the billion active Instagram users the company also has.</p>\n<p>Jordan Banks, managing director of Facebook and Instagram Canada, officially opened up the new Canadian headquarters yesterday. The office is located within MaRS Discovery District, occupies 20,000 square feet, and welcomes a great deal of Canadian companies within its space.</p>\n<h5> Q: We follow the mobile space in Canada and Facebook has a great deal of connections in mobile. How many Canadians are on Facebook? </h5>\n<p>We have 21 million Canadians on Facebook out of an addressable internet population of 29 million. And 18 million of those 21 million Canadians access us on a mobile device.</p>\n<p>No surprise that when you saw our earnings that 82 percent of Facebook\u2019s global revenue is generated on a mobile device. That is 75 percent year-over-year growth. So it\u2019s just really a proxy for how important mobile is in our business, but more broadly, just how important mobile is as a mini computer in the pockets of 3.5 billion people around the world. I get a chuckle because one of the things that people love to talk about is the emerging trend of mobile but, as you guys know it\u2019s emerged. This little mini computer will have influence over everything you do in every waking hour of your life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook-4-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"facebook\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-64913\" /></p>\n<p>Facebook and Instagram together now account for one in every four mobile minutes spent in Canada, including talk time. We continue to be a very important part of the mix.</p>\n<h5> Q: How many Instagram users are located in Canada? </h5>\n<p>We have 7 million Instagram users in Canada. We\u2019ve developed a very passionate and dedicated Instagram community in Canada.</p>\n<p>Q: What about Messenger users? How many are in Canada? </p>\n<p>We don\u2019t break our Messenger users by country but there are about 1 billion Messenger users around the world. Messenger is playing a very important role, not only in the way people communicate, but if you look at Rogers for example, who was one of the early adopters of Messenger for business, the company had over 70,000 interactions with their customers using Facebook Messenger.</p>\n<p>Over that period of time, they saw a 65 percent increase in customer satisfaction and a 65 percent decrease in complaints. So, you want to be where the people are and you want to make it seamless for them to communicate \u2013 Facebook Messenger is a good place to do that.</p>\n<h5> Q: How is Facebook getting deeper into business? </h5>\n<p>When you have 21 million Canadians anywhere, regardless if you own a single dry cleaner or the largest retailer in Canada, you want to have the ability to talk to customers and potential customers in a way that is highly relevant and personalized to them.</p>\n<p>So, right place, right message, right timing on the right device. By virtue of our ubiquity, Facebook and Instagram have become the defacto places to do that. Businesses are thinking about how to use Facebook and Instagram in a meaningful way to connect with their audience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mobilesyrup-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"facebook\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-64914\" /></p>\n<h5> Q: And what about charity work? </h5>\n<p>Charity work has been one of the most fascinating things we\u2019ve seen. I would say over the last two years we\u2019ve seen non-profits go from fairly rudimentary and basic in the way they\u2019ve thought about using Facebook and Instagram, to being very sophisticated.</p>\n<p>You see the CMO of the Heart and Stroke Foundation talking his fuel and currency is really getting email addresses. So using Facebook and Instagram\u2026 they will see a 65 percent increase in the number of email solicitations that they are able to procure.</p>\n<p>In an era where currencies are not only monetary \u2013 things like intellectual capability, goods, time\u2013Facebook does give you the opportunity to avail all those options to people that are interested in what you do. What we are also seeing is big businesses learn from non-profits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook-16-1024x682-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"facebook\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-64915\" /></p>\n<h5> Q: So Facebook is having a significant impact globally? </h5>\n<p>One of the posters in our office says, \u201cDon\u2019t confuse motion for impact.\u201d What we try to do is ensure that we use every unit of our time to drive and produce the largest amount of impact. We are fairly judicious in how we spend our time, how we allocate our time and what types of business and non-profits we work with. I think what we\u2019ve done a really job of, with it telling people, especially in this country, is ensuring that our presence here is creating an impact across the scale of opportunities in these organizations.</p>\n<h5> Q: How many people work at Facebook Canada? </h5>\n<p>There are 75 people in this office. We also have smaller offices in Ottawa, Vancouver, and Montreal. So we have a true coast-to-coast presence.</p>\n<h5> Q: In terms of this office, what happens here? </h5>\n<p>It\u2019s everything but product development. So it\u2019s business development, creative excellence, marketing, PR and communications, community, sales, and measurement. Seven years ago we launched in Canada and we were just a sales and marketing office and by virtue of the size of the Canadian community, and the interest from Canadian businesses and non-profits, we\u2019ve had to scale across all those other disciplines.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook-14-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"facebook\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-64916\" /></p>\n<h5> Q: What is next for Facebook Canada and Instagram? </h5>\n<p>Broadly we think about a 10-year time horizon as a business and we divide it into three-year chunks. Over the next three years what we are really focussed on is the Facebook app and the Facebook platform. If you expand it to the next 5-years, we are going to focus a great deal of time and money on building eco-systems around all of our products and services. If you expand it even more over the course of the next decade, I think what you\u2019d hear from Mark is that we are laser focussed on connecting the unconnected world, which right now is about 4 billion plus people who have no internet activity.</p>\n<p>It all stems from having a leader, who is 31 years old, and is the most mission driven and visionary leader that I would argue who has every existed on the planet. He doesn\u2019t think about incremental mentality at all. He starts thinking about billions and then thinks about connecting 7.5 billion. When you have a leader that is driven, passionate and smart, it really is no surprise that Facebook, Instagram and all our other family of apps and services have become so ubiquitous and powerful in relatively a short period of time.</p>\n<h5> Q: You mentioned virtual. Why is VR important to Facebook\u2019s future? </h5>\n<p>It\u2019s an interesting question. There are two answers. The first is that if you look at the evolution of content production, especially on the internet, we started with text, then added some photos, now we see video, more live video, and 360-degree video. So it begs the question \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d We fundamentally believe that virtual reality is the next way to truly immerse yourself in engaging and compelling content.</p>\n<p>The second thing that we think a lot about is, \u201cwhat is the next true computing platform where we will help build and facilitate an ecosystem?\u201d In talking to very smart, young people at universities and startups, they all fundamentally believe that VR is the next big thing. The next big computing platform. So you put those two things together and it was a natural bet for us to place\u2026 we are just getting started.</p>\n<p><em>Patrick O\u2019Rourke contributed to this interview<br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/29/facebook-canada-head-jordan-banks-says-the-social-network-is-just-getting-started/\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/managing-director-of-facebook-canada-speaks-on-how-the-company-is-dominating-mobile/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>1000 Angels launches Startup Return Calculator to support investors making funding decisions</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/1000-angels-launches-startup-return-calculator-to-support-investors-making-funding-decisions/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/1000-angels-launches-startup-return-calculator-to-support-investors-making-funding-decisions/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 19:59:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Launches]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65153</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[1000 Angels, a OneVest-owned network that connects vetted startups with investors, launched a new tool to help investors determine the potential value of the...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>1000 Angels, a <a href=\"http://www.1000angels.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OneVest-owned network</a> that connects vetted startups with investors, launched a new tool to help investors determine the potential value of the startups they want to invest in: the <a href=\"https://members.1000angels.com/returncalculator\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Return Calculator.</a></p>\n<p>The calculator is open to investors and entrepreneurs, and requires users to fill out questions, such as the amount of years of company revenue projections and annual costs of goods sold. Alejandro Cremades, co-founder and executive chairman of Onevest, said that the tool is valuable for investors that want to know if their investment opportunities are worthwhile. Entrepreneurs can leverage the startup calculator during fundraising conversations to demonstrate the potential initial rate of return and cash-on-cash return investors could receive. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a tool we use to analyze potential returns for investment opportunities we evaluate for 1000 Angels members. The questions asked help us compare different startup investment opportunities on an apples to apples basis by both calculating potential IRR and cash on cash return,&#8221; said Cremades. &#8220;We have found it very useful and thought other investors and startups might find it useful as well in analyzing the risk and return potential of prospective investments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As there are many non-tangible factors that go into the decision to invest in a company \u2014 such as trust in a founding team&#8217;s track record \u2014 Cremades said that this acts as supporting tool and not a replacement. &#8220;The calculator is an added benefit to the investor when performing the due diligence on the company. The more information and tools you can arm yourself with the better.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://betakit.com/onevest-launches-1000-angels-an-invitation-only-investor-network/\" target=\"_blank\">Related: Onevest launches 1000 Angels, an invitation-only investor network</a>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/1000-angels-launches-startup-return-calculator-to-support-investors-making-funding-decisions/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Hack to Start Ep. 95: Assist co-founder and CEO Shane Mac</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/hack-to-start-ep-95-assist-co-founder-and-ceo-shane-mac/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/hack-to-start-ep-95-assist-co-founder-and-ceo-shane-mac/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 17:57:57 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Franco Varriano]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65151</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[This week\u2019s guest is Shane Mac, the co\u00ad-founder and CEO of Assist, bring the best services to your favourite messaging apps.

If you wanted to get your product into the hands of millions of people around the world, ten or 20 years ago you had to go to Best Buy or Wal-mart and convince a retail buyer to put your product on the shelves,\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cNow, the Internet gives you distribution all over the world. Today, if you want to raise a money for a prototype, you can go on a crowdfunding platform. If you want to create a prototype, you can use a 3D printing machine, you don\u2019t have to go to China.\u201d</p>\n<p>During the jam-packed day, Canada\u2019s top entrepreneurs from across the country spoke to how technology today enables business to thrive that wouldn\u2019t survive twenty years ago \u2014 and how larger enterprises or fellow startups could keep up. Much of the morning featured speakers and panelists who could share insights on every stage of the business, from the early days when companies may consider crowdfunding, to looking back on mistakes made as a larger company. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/globesummit.jpg\" alt=\"globesummit\" width=\"960\" height=\"710\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65141\" /></p>\n<p>As Shopify went public a year ago, Finkelstein could relate both to the struggle of staying innovative as a startup and maintaining that culture as a larger public company. Part of maintaining culture, he says, is staying as transparent as you started; one way the company does this is through hosting an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session with Shopify executives every Friday, where employees ask questions and upvote the top issues. </p>\n<p>\u201cMany people think that transparency is a team email once a year or a month,\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cWe want people to understand what we\u2019re thinking about and give them a sense of what our roadmap is and what keeps us up at night. I think transparency and being candid with your team allows you to scale culture.\u201d</p>\n<p>Describing going public like \u201cgraduation\u201d, Finkelstein said that the experience allowed them to hire more senior talent more comfortable with working at a public company, and that the executive team remained dedicated to keeping the company \u201csheltered\u201d from the short-term pressure quarter-to-quarter. When asked by the audience what resources that entrepreneurs can turn to for support, Finkelstein mentioned that there is a wealth of resources now than when he started, including BetaKit. &#8220;I think it\u2019s much easier today, BetaKit didn\u2019t exist in 2010. MaRS was just getting set up here in Toronto. There\u2019s probably more startup technology meetups in Toronto than I can even count on one hand. It\u2019s easier to find these meetups and find your tribe when you\u2019re getting set up.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Finkelstein said that the company continues to hire for potential, not experience. \u201cWe find the \u2018life story\u2019 question valuable because what we\u2019re looking for is the person who got deep into something; someone who saw a problem and got deep into it and understood the entirety of problem. We want the person who started a charity, not worked for a charity.\u201d</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13148228_10154102626758788_920483687_o-1024x773.jpg\" alt=\"globesummit\" width=\"690\" height=\"521\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-65142\" /></p>\n<p>The latter issue is something that Communitech\u2019s program talent manager Andrea Gilbrook spoke on during her talk, <em>Hiring the Best Technical Talent</em>. She said that 38 percent of large companies last year reported having difficulty hiring for their roles, and part of the reason was that companies didn\u2019t have a strong employee value proposition. Attracting the right talent is about understanding the characteristics about a company\u2019s top performers and why they stay, and going beyond the boring list of job descriptions \u2014 companies should be candid both about the best and worst parts about the job. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the compelling reasons why a talented person would want to work for you. It\u2019s not the ping pong tables, it\u2019s not the comp and benefits, it\u2019s not those things that are tangible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the entire experience you\u2019re looking for when you got to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the smaller companies just trying to figure out how to secure funding, one of the morning panels hosted by <em>The Globe</em>\u2019s technology reporter Shane Dingman \u2014 featuring Robleh Jama, founder at <a href=\"http://tinyhearts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tiny Hearts</a>; Jillian Bowman, founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://epicuredmarket.myshopify.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Epicured Market</a>; and Don McDonald, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.waverleycf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Waverley Corporate Financial Services</a> \u2014 focused on crowdfunding. The panelists touched on how to figure out if crowdfunding was right for your business, and how to make it successful. \u201cDo you have a compelling story? Are you solving a problem felt by most people? Because you\u2019re reaching out to total strangers. If you have niche market you need to figure out if going to the crowd is even the best decision.\u201d Bowman said. </p>\n<p>Jama said that the company found success in crowdfunding for its Next keyboard largely because they had a mobilized a group of early adopters willing to fund the campaign before it even started, and came up with out-of-the-box ways to raise awareness like sending poop emoji mugs to journalists. \u201cI would do it again for hardware and not software. Software has difficulty in terms of distribution, and we had a lot of issues we had to deal with,\u201d Jama said, looking back at his experience. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe equity crowdfunding model in Canada is very new,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cWe\u2019re about five years behind the UK. We need some success stories i would love for us to be a burgeoning source of capital for young companies, but for that to happen we need people to get out of bed in the morning and say \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to go buy securities in a private company today on the Internet. We\u2019re not there yet, but probably we\u2019ll see a lot of failures before we see successes which is a big risk.\u201d</p>\n<p>But as Finkelstein said at the top of the event, it&#8217;s the willingness to embrace failure and learn from it that builds the foundation for successful business. Just this morning, Shopify reported <a href=\"http://betakit.com/shopify-releases-q1-2016-results-announces-95-percent-increase-in-revenue-yoy/\" target=\"_blank\">95 percent increase in revenue</a> YoY as it moves toward mobile. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Most mistakes that we make from a company perspective, we kind of look at them as failure is the successful identification of something new and insightful,&#8221; Finkelstein said.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/globesbs16-shopifys-harley-finkelstein-on-how-large-companies-maintain-startup-culture/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Shopify releases Q1 2016 results, announces 95 percent increase in revenue YoY</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/shopify-releases-q1-2016-results-announces-95-percent-increase-in-revenue-yoy/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/shopify-releases-q1-2016-results-announces-95-percent-increase-in-revenue-yoy/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 15:26:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[retail]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65132</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Shopify&#8217;s first quarter 2016 results are in.

The company has continually demonstrated that it can hold its own as a public company since its IPO last year, and is maintaining its growth since it <a href=\"http://betakit.com/shopify-revenue-hits-70-2-million-usd-in-q4-99-yoy-growth/\">last reported Q4 2015 results</a>, when it reported 99 percent YoY growth.</p>\n<p>As of March 31, 2016, Shopify&#8217;s total revenue was $72.7 million, a 95 percent increase from the first quarter of 2015. Thanks to an increase in merchants using the company&#8217;s platform, subscription solutions revenue grew 73 percent to $38.7 million, while merchant solutions revenue grew 127 percent to $34.0 million, primarily driven by an increase in revenue from Shopify Payments.</p>\n<p>Monthly recurring revenue was $12.8 million, up 73 percent compared with $7.4 million during the same time last year. Gross profit grew 82 percent to $39.3 million for the first quarter of 2016, versus $21.6 million for the first quarter of 2015. The company also reported an increase in operating loss for the first quarter of 2016 at $9.7 million, compared to $3.5 million for the first quarter of 2015.</p>\n<p>Company highlights include mobile orders surpassing desktop for the first time ever; just over 51 percent of orders exiting the quarter came from mobile devices while the share of traffic from mobile devices in the quarter was even higher at 62 percent.</p>\n<p>Mark MacLeod, founder of SurePath Capital and former Shopify CFO, indicated that Shopify is set to become a leader in the mobile space. &#8220;Shopify is continuing its strong momentum as a public company and clear market leader. Revenues are up 95 percent year on year. More fundamentally, the pace of innovation is staggering. This is a big reason why mobile orders have now surpassed desktop,&#8221; said MacLeod. &#8220;This is an inevitable trend, but Shopify is leading the pack. I typically see 30 percent mobile with other e-commerce companies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As Shopify <a href=\"http://betakit.com/shopify-acquires-san-francisco-based-virtual-marketing-assistant-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">announced the acquisition of Kit</a>, a bot that manages social marketing for small businesses via SMS, it&#8217;s clear that the company sees its future in mobile.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe era of mobile commerce has officially arrived: mobile orders from Shopify merchants surpassed those of desktops in February, and have continued to climb since,\u201d said Tobi L\u00fctke, founder and CEO of Shopify. \u201cMobile is bringing commerce to places it\u2019s never been before, it is making it more social, and we are pushing that forward in a big way. With our recent integration with Facebook\u2019s new Messenger platform and our acquisition of a leader in mobile messaging for commerce, Kit CRM, we\u2019re making it easier for our merchants to thrive in this new era.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the full year 2016, Shopify expects revenue in the range of $337 million to $347 million, and GAAP operating loss in the range of $41 million to $47 million.</p>\n<p>Read the full report <a href=\"https://investors.shopify.com/Investor-News-Details/2016/Shopify-Announces-First-Quarter-2016-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/shopify-releases-q1-2016-results-announces-95-percent-increase-in-revenue-yoy/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The City of Toronto legalizes Uber (with a few changes)</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/the-city-of-toronto-legalizes-uber-with-a-few-changes/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/the-city-of-toronto-legalizes-uber-with-a-few-changes/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 13:42:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ian Hardy]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65128</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[After months of city council debate\u00a0and taxi driver protests,\u00a0ride-sharing services, most notably UberX, are officially legal in Toronto.

The total vote in favour of legalizing ride-sharing services was 27 to 15, with Mayor John Tory leading the &#8220;yes&#8221; charge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe this motion represents the best possible way to do the two things I have talked about, which is to regulate these companies that have come into the marketplace and to make sure that the taxi industry can survive and thrive going forward,&#8221; said Tory at Toronto city hall.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Big news Toronto&#8230; City council welcomed ridesharing today! Thank you Toronto and Mayor Tory.

But it\u2019s not that simple.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much focus on pre-investment \u2013 it\u2019s a very sexy industry because people like reading about money.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;There\u2019s so much focus on pre-investment &#8211; finding good deals, raising money online &#8211; it\u2019s a very sexy industry because people like reading about money. But behind closed doors, all the investors and funds that I talk to say that \u2018after we write the cheque, we don\u2019t have the stream of information\u2019. We focused on the problem of, &#8216;what happens after a fund makes their investments&#8217;?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Luk\u2019s company, <a href=\"https://hockeystick.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Hockeystick</a>, provides that post-investment stream of information through a variety of dashboards and reports, consolidating financial statements and cash statements, fundraising details, CEO updates and asks into one handy platform for each company in an investor\u2019s portfolio. Hockeystick already has over 10,000 private companies on the platform, providing data to both VC and private equity investors with funds ranging from 100 to 5,000 companies in their portfolio.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe hard part is getting the data,\u201d Luk says, indicating that Hockeystick did the hard work of integrating with financial tools like QuickBooks to automate grabbing the data to make it very easy for entrepreneurs. He argues that this frees up investors to focus less on making sure the proper information is being delivered, and more on helping their portfolio succeed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe scariest thing for a CEO is starting every quarter with a blank email and having to generate good news, because that\u2019s what they feel like they have to do,\u201d he says. &#8220;With out platform, our investors design forms where it\u2019s like \u2019tell us the bad news first\u2019.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hockeystick-cropped-1024x639.jpg\" alt=\"Hockeystick dashboard\" width=\"690\" height=\"431\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-65113\" /></p>\n<p>While Hockeystick saves entrepreneurs from blank emails or ancient Excel spreadsheets, Luk acknowledges that some may balk at so much internal information flowing so freely to investors. However, he counters that those entrepreneurs looking to hide their company\u2019s reality from investors are generally facing bigger problems.</p>\n<p>\u201cEntrepreneurs forget: yes, you\u2019ve raised your first round, but every update, meeting, coffee is you raising your next round from investors. If those investors decide not to invest, it\u2019s a huge negative signal to the next guy.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting extremely accurate data that nobody has.\u201d\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>With that in mind, Hockeystick has raised its own $600,000 seed round from a group of U.S. and Canadian investors, including LaunchPad Venture Group, BDC Capital, York Angels, and Spark Angels (disclosure: as a HIGHLINE portfolio company, Hockeystick sat across from BetaKit for awhile in HIGHLINE Toronto&#8217;s co-working space). It\u2019s a move that Luk says he avoided \u201cas long as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re experimenting, you\u2019re basically learning, the worst thing you can do is raise money,\u201d he says. &#8220;Because raising money is about selling a business plan and the implication that \u2018I will deliver this result for you\u2019. it makes it harder to pivot. It\u2019s easier under the microscope of a customer kicking your butt, because when you fix something you get your next stipend.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But with consistent revenue (Hockeystick charges investors anywhere from $200 to $2,000 a month for access to their portfolio\u2019s data) and a low burn, Luk felt that the model was sturdy enough to start gathering capital for the second phase of the plan: building the tools to make all the portfolio data the company is collecting useful at a meta-level.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur bigger vision is that all the operational data companies generate is really useful,\u201d Luk says. &#8220;You can apply data science to it. We see a future where you can take that data and run predictive analytics on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Luk believes that soon Hockeystick will be able to compete with investment databases like CB Insights, which rely mostly on survey data. By getting their info direct from the source &#8211; the startups themselves &#8211; Hockeystick is operating at a higher level of data fidelity. \u201cWe\u2019re getting extremely accurate data that nobody has,\u201d Luk says.</p>\n<p>While his team builds out those tools and APIs to turn their data into insights, Luk is already looking to raise Hockeystick\u2019s next round.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe that you raise the amount you need plus a little bit to get to the next milestone. If you raise too much more than that, you just dilute at a really early stage. It kind of keeps the business honest.&#8221;\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/with-new-seed-funding-hockeystick-looks-to-compete-with-cb-insights-for-startup-data/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Startup Canada Podcast: Empowering Cities and Going Global With Brenda Halloran</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/startup-canada-podcast-empowering-cities-and-going-global-with-brenda-halloran/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/startup-canada-podcast-empowering-cities-and-going-global-with-brenda-halloran/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 20:15:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Startup Canada]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kitchener-Waterloo]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[podcast]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65099</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Brenda Halloran\u2019s father was an entrepreneur before the word even existed.

The company said it will use the funding to invest in continued product development and to accelerate recruitment of new web designer and agency partners.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe built LemonStand for web designers and their fast growing clients.

For the last year, the innovative 3D printing design marketplace <a href=\"https://pinshape.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinshape</a> was banking on consistent traction of more than 50 percent growth on average per month from its community, along with impressive engagement by the designer and maker community that would probably make most tech startups jealous (including 90,000 active users and 1,500-plus downloads to their community every day). Still, that dedicated following and passion for their product almost weren&#8217;t enough and the 3D community came very close to losing it all.</p>\n<p>Now, barely a month after Pinshape announced it was <a href=\"https://pinshape.com/goodbye\">shutting down its platform</a>, citing lower-than-expected support from an unsteady investment community, the firm has found a happy ending: it has been acquired by <a href=\"http://formlabs.com/\">Formlabs</a>, a leading Boston-based 3D products manufacturer that got its start at MIT. Formlabs may be best known for raising the biggest round of funding ($3 million) through <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/formlabs/form-1-an-affordable-professional-3d-printer\">Kickstarter</a> of any tech-crowdfunding venture up to 2012, for an \u201caffordable, professional 3D printer\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We exited to Formlabs because they\u2019re best suited to take us to the next level.&#8221;<br />\n&#8211; Lucas Matheson</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cRight after we made the announcement, we were contacted by a number of people in the industry and we exited to Formlabs because they\u2019re best suited to take us to the next level,\u201d Pinshape Founder Lucas Matheson says. \u201cFormlabs and the team at Pinshape share a similar approach to the marketplace and we\u2019re excited for opportunities to grow our community.\u201d</p>\n<p>Max Lobovsky, co-founder &amp; CEO of Formlabs, echoed Matheson\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cWe\u2019ve been following Pinshape for some time. We\u2019ve been impressed by what Pinshape has built, its collaborative community, and the quality of the community\u2019s work in 3D designs. Formlabs shares with Pinshape the same passion in making sophisticated 3D printing technology widely accessible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reflecting on Pinshape\u2019s success in building a community and reputation in a bleeding-edge industry, Matheson says he\u2019s grateful for the lessons he learned from <a href=\"http://500.co/\">500 Startups</a> in learning how to scale a company. \u201cThat experience gave us a lot of the tools and strategies early on to deal with some of the challenges we were facing. Of course, there\u2019s no magic bullet. Growing was the result of executing on smaller challenges along the way. One of the things our team did well was hire really talented people \u2013 we have a team of eight now and everyone is a first-class employee who has worked tremendously hard to build this ecosystem.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/3d-printing-startup-pinshape-acquired-by-formlabs/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Google acquires Toronto-based Synergse to add to its Apps product suite</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/google-acquires-toronto-based-synergse-to-add-to-its-apps-product-suite/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/google-acquires-toronto-based-synergse-to-add-to-its-apps-product-suite/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 12:30:29 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Patrick O'Rourke]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Acquisitions]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[acquisitions]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65053</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Google has reportedly acquired Toronto-based Synergse in order to create a new training tool for its suite of Google apps.

According to Synergse, companies that take advantage of its training services have \u201con average 35 percent higher adoption across Apps products, meaning those organizations are more likely to be productive, collaborative and embrace digital transformation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Google says that Synergyse has built a virtual coach within Google Apps\u2019 interface and cloud-based platform, featuring interactive teaching modules that include both voice and text guides.</p>\n<p>Following the acquisiton, Synergyse says that all training related to Google Apps will now be free.

Continuing to hire Canada\u2019s top design and software engineering talent will also remain as a focus for the company.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis capital allows us to remove any constraints to ensuring our culture and environments can flourish as we undergo this rapid employee growth,\u201d said Ian Crosby. </p>\n<p>The new round brings Bench&#8217;s total capital raised to $33 million. The company says that by creating task-specific algorithms and perfecting tools that can work seamlessly with bank data and payment data, Bench has reduced the labour time of its bookkeepers by 75 percent.</p>\n<p>\u201cBench is capturing the attention of people who grew up with the Internet and who seek convenient cloud and mobile solutions to eliminate unwanted tasks. BCV was impressed with the level of scalability Bench has achieved and is excited by the chance to back an important new SMB platform,\u201d said Indy Guha, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures and a Bench board member.</p>\n<p>Since its $7 million Series A funding announcement in January 2015, Bench has doubled its workforce in Vancouver to 230 employees while expanding its service to thousands of small businesses across the US.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/bench-raises-20-million-cad-series-b-as-it-focuses-on-building-new-product/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Influitive adds former Salesforce senior director to its team as it pursues aggressive growth</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/influitive-adds-former-salesforce-senior-director-to-its-team-as-it-pursues-aggressive-growth/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/influitive-adds-former-salesforce-senior-director-to-its-team-as-it-pursues-aggressive-growth/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 11:00:43 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[marketing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65061</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Influitive has been quietly building its advocate marketing empire over the past few months.

In March, the company announced two acquisitions that same month, which included <a href=\"http://betakit.com/influitive-acquires-triggerfox-marking-second-acquisition-this-month/\" target=\"_blank\">mobile relationship management platform Triggerfox</a>and <a href=\"http://betakit.com/influitive-raises-additional-8-2-million-acquires-ironark-software/\" target=\"_blank\">Ironark Software</a>, which developed both business and home organizer apps. Both companies were acquired for their ability to help Influitive to expand their advocate marketing software to mobile. </p>\n<p>\u201cMobile is changing everything, and we really want to have people on board that are not just mobile first, but mobile-only,\u201d said <a href=\"http://influitive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Influitive</a> CEO and founder Mark Organ. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why we acquired Ironark and Triggerfox, as they has some great strengths in mobile as used by sales professionals, and that\u2019s an area we\u2019ve been keenly interested for a while. A lot of customers have asked us to expand our products not just to marketers, but sales people.\u201d</p>\n<p>As part of its growth strategy, Influitive announced that it has added a new executive to its team.<br />\nJesse Goldman will be joining as vice president of customer success to advance and scale the company\u2019s customer success efforts.</p>\n<p>Goldman\u2019s past experience includes acting as a senior director at Salesforce, where he led customer success for the company\u2019s Work.com product and launched new customer success offerings to support all Salesforce products and customers. He was also vice president of Customer Success at Rypple, which was acquired by Salesforce.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Advocacy is the ultimate measure of customer success. It is the driving force behind forward-thinking customer engagement strategies employed by some of the world&#8217;s most successful companies,&#8221; said Goldman. &#8220;Influitive is uniquely positioned to create the advocate marketing category that is transforming how all B2B companies accelerate growth and track the health of their business. I am honoured to partner with Influitive&#8217;s customers to develop the gold standard for customer success and growth powered by advocacy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As part of its acquisition of Ironark back in March, Influitive raised a $8.2 million in a Series B extension, bringing its total <a href=\"http://betakit.com/influitive-closes-30-5m-series-b-round/\" target=\"_blank\">Series B funding to $38.7 million</a>. While the company company faces the oft-discussed \u2018Series B crunch\u2019 that faces startups hitting this milestone, Organ isn\u2019t phased. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that raising money is ever easy, particularly in Toronto. But we\u2019re very committed to keeping our headquarters here even though we do have a presence in the Valley and Boston. We\u2019re in a period where investors are getting jittery but they need to put their money somewhere,\u201d Organ said. </p>\n<p>Organ has said that the company is working on products \u2018synergistic\u2019 with its core offering, which helps companies market more effectively by mobilizing \u2018happy customer bases\u2019 to support marketing campaigns and recruit new clients. During a time when advertisers are finding difficulty reaching tech-savvy audiences, it can be a lifesaving solution. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor now, we\u2019re building our corporate development muscles to identify and integrate them well. We can integrate tech and people and that\u2019s easier to do in Toronto than it is to do it in other cities. We think there\u2019s a lot of great talent and tech,\u201d said Organ. </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/influitive-adds-former-salesforce-senior-director-to-its-team-as-it-pursues-aggressive-growth/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>#BKchats: Let&#8217;s talk about startups and mental health</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/bkchats-lets-talk-about-startups-and-mental-health/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/bkchats-lets-talk-about-startups-and-mental-health/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 21:04:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Douglas Soltys]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=65044</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[72% of entrepreneurs report being affected by mental health conditions, and a third of them claim to be affected by two or more issues....]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>72% of entrepreneurs report being affected by mental health conditions, and a third of them claim to be affected by two or more issues. Those are the numbers published in a recent <a href=\"http://betakit.com/why-entrepreneurs-need-to-make-mental-health-a-priority/\" target=\"_blank\">BetaKit op-ed on mental health</a> by IPFS founder Chris Gory, explaining why entrepreneurs need to make mental health a priority.</p>\n<p>This week is the <a href=\"http://mentalhealthweek.cmha.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Mental Health Association\u2019s annual Mental Health Week</a>, and with that we thought we\u2019d extend the conversation into a few different forms. In reaching out for guests for a <a href=\"http://betakit.com/cancon-podcast-ep-15-lets-talk-startups-and-mental-health/\" target=\"_blank\">special edition</a> of the CanCon podcast, we were overwhelmed by the number of entrepreneurs and players in the Canadian startup space eager to share their story &#8211; to join in on the conversation. So we decided upon a Twitter chat to open up the conversation to as many voices as possible.</p>\n<p>Brought to you by BetaKit and <a href=\"http://ipfs.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">IPFS</a>, this #BKchats will be a little different. While the conversation will feature a group of special guest participants, <em>all</em> are encouraged to show up and share on this subject that affects so many of us (yes, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tron/what-i-think-about-when-i-am-alone-bellletstalk-4f4dc491e6af#.ywuaxqmu7\" target=\"_blank\">including BetaKit</a>).

This week is packed, so be sure to listen carefully. We also have Charles Iliya Krempeaux from <a href=\"https://www.koho.ca/#/home\" target=\"_blank\">Koho</a> as our special guest.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in seeing the video with the 14\u00ad-year\u00ad-old girl talking about how horrible Canadian banks are, you can watch the video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx5Sc3vWefE&#038;app=desktop\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Charles grew up in Vancouver and spent the majority of his career here. He has an impressive resume and list of accomplishments. We talk about all of the meetups Charles organizes as well as some of the past companies he has worked with.</p>\n<p>Charles is currently the CTO of Koho. Koho provides a no-\u00adfee, simple, modern, mobile alternative to a chequing account. They are not a bank, and that makes them pretty awesome for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>Charles also talks about some of his past jobs in the Vancouver area, including Hootsuite and EA Games. If you are interested in Machine Learning or Data Science, Charles is the organizer of multiple meetups for those subjects. He goes over some of the differences between the 2 data science meetups, as well as what to expect from the Machine Learning group.

AccessNow is a crowdsourced web app that allows users can skim through restaurants, cafes, and hotels in their city to find out if that place has the accessibility features they need, such as elevators, ramps, or braille menus. For places that aren&#8217;t already on the map, users can contribute their own information to the directory. Currently, AccessNow is concentrated in Toronto, but people in other Canadian cities like Edmonton, as well as cities in the US and Europe, have begun adding pins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I launched AccessNow out of the need to solve my own problem, as someone with a disability myself, I&#8217;ve also encountered that frustration whenever I&#8217;m trying to find an accessible place,&#8221; said Ziv. &#8220;I figured, why not be able to provide a platform that would allow anyone who shares the same kind of barrier in their life to exchange information?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Co-host Amber Kanwar said that while Google has the geolocation market down, startups like AccessNow are carving a niche in the market. &#8220;This is a great thing for all entrepreneurs to be able to do. It&#8217;s to borrow from somebody else&#8217;s playbook, but make it fit your needs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As Ziv is a member of <a href=\"https://www.thenext36.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">The Next 36</a>, co-host Bruce Croxon had the chance to meet with her in the past. &#8220;When you get an example of somebody that has lived their life a certain way, and then develops their app directly from a need they&#8217;ve experienced, it&#8217;s a recipe for success.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Watch the whole pitch below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=859185&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a production partner on <a href=\"http://betakit.com/category/the-disruptors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Disruptors</a>.

To date, NBIF has invested $500,000 in the company, which provides vision systems, sensors, and software that detect, learn, and correct defects in areas like raw material waste and inefficient energy use.

But is IoT one subject, one industry, or a blanket term for a myriad number of devices, technologies, products, and verticals? And how are Canadians adopting those products, in both the smart homes and businesses of the future?

In the first two videos released in the 10-video series, the BCIC talks to entrepreneurs on kickstarting sales and finding first customers. </p>\n<p>&#8220;You need to rely on those early customers as ambassadors, testimonials, and evangelists, and as people who will help you find the love language of your target audience,&#8221; said Keith Ippel, founder of <a href=\"http://spring.is/\" target=\"_blank\">Spring</a>, on the importance of first customers in shaping your product.</p>\n<p>Jeanette Jackson, executive in residence at the <a href=\"http://foresightcac.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Foresight cleantech accelerator</a>, outlined that kickstarting sales starts with an understanding of your company first. &#8220;The first thing you need to do is make sure you have clarity on your business.

Homeowners disclose details about their home on the site, while real estate professionals bid down their commission rate for your business. The company has processed 20,000 transactions since its launch in January 2015. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Real estate agents love feeDuck because we have all the home sellers in our system who are ready to buy now. Agents spend thousands of dollars blanket marketing neighbourhoods, looking for homeowners that are ready to sell. And we have them all right now,&#8221; said Sharn Kandola, co-founder of feeDuck. </p>\n<p>Co-host Bruce Croxon joked that his real estate agent friends were probably shedding a tear. &#8220;To me, it&#8217;s part of a growing trend that if you have broker in your name, you&#8217;re going the way of the dinosaur as consumers get more articulate and capable, through technology, of doing their own thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Co-host Amber Kanwar said that technology also makes these industries more transparent. &#8220;It democratizes things, so if I&#8217;m not a good negotiator, that doesn&#8217;t matter because then I just have to go on a platform and they bid for my business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch the whole pitch below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=859184&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a production partner on <a href=\"http://betakit.com/category/the-disruptors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Disruptors</a>.

Companies with gender-diverse boards tend to outperform those with no women on their boards and indices of companies with mixed-gender boards have outperformed benchmark indices,&#8221; said Kevin Gopaul, chief investment officer and senior vice-president of BMO Global Asset Management. </p>\n<p>The launch of the Women in Leadership Fund marks Canada&#8217;s first impact investing mutual fund by a Canadian bank, and invests in North American companies that promote gender-diverse leadership; the fund will invest in North American companies that have a female CEO or a board of directors with at least 25 percent female representation, referencing the Barclays Women in Leadership North America Index.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An increasing number of investors are seeking both financial and social returns from their investments,&#8221; said Joanna Rotenberg, head of personal wealth management, BMO Financial Group. &#8220;By providing them with the opportunity to invest in organizations with a higher representation of women, we are giving those investors the ability to promote change by rewarding gender-diverse companies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>BMO&#8217;s Fossil Fuel Free Fund will invest in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities that excludes companies primarily involved in the development and infrastructure of fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Canadians care about the environment and about the potential impact of fossil fuel extraction and dependence,&#8221; said Gopaul. &#8220;As a global fund that focuses on companies with strong businesses and significant growth potential, BMO Fossil Fuel Free Fund provides Canadian investors with the option to have a diversified portfolio while avoiding fossil fuel producers.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://betakit.com/wealthsimple-launches-responsible-investment-portfolio-to-attract-socially-conscious-millennials/\" target=\"_blank\">Related: Wealthsimple launches responsible investment portfolio to attract socially-conscious millennials</a>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/bmo-launches-women-in-leadership-and-fossil-fuel-free-funds/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>#TechVAN April: Millennials controlling the future, and how to do better beta testing</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/techvan-april-millennials-controlling-the-future-and-how-to-do-better-beta-testing/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/techvan-april-millennials-controlling-the-future-and-how-to-do-better-beta-testing/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2016 18:18:30 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Charis Whitbourne]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Event Recaps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[events]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64906</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Vancouver\u2019s tech community was in full force for the third #TechVAN event, hosted at the Rise HQ in downtown Vancouver.\u00a0Wisam Abdulla, CEO and co-founder...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Vancouver\u2019s tech community was in full force for the third #TechVAN event, hosted at the Rise HQ in downtown Vancouver.\u00a0Wisam Abdulla, CEO and co-founder of software startup <a href=\"http://rise.xyz/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Rise</a>, was the first to take the stage, where he discussed how millennials are changing the business landscape.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re seeing today, the shifting landscapes, the disruption of old school industry is being driven by something else, and I would say it is being driven by millennials,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cFirstly, millennials are driving who gets the best\u00a0people \u2014 so they are driving which companies are getting the best talent, and in order to win in any business you need the best talent. Secondly, millennials are controlling which companies get the dollars. By 2025, 75 percent of the workforce is going to be millennials, and with 75 percent of the workforce making 75 percent of the money that means the world is changing in their direction.\u201d</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_D3m2Ggggs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Millennials have\u00a0a different sense of purpose to their work than past generations, Abdulla notes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI always say the people who work at Rise are volunteers. They can go anywhere they want, and probably make more money. But the reason they are here is their purpose and their ability to change the world, and that gives meaning to their work.\u201d</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxLRLWaPOiU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Next up was Jack Newton from <a href=\"https://www.goclio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Clio</a>, a cloud-based law practice management software, who talked about\u00a0the best way to test out a new startup idea. He said that testing a product on as many people as possible, with the goal of getting more feedback, isn&#8217;t always the best approach.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You need culture because when the going gets tough, the tough gets going, and when the tough gets going you need a reason to go.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cUnless you are launching a product that has a bootstrapping aspect to it, like a social network or a marketplace, that is the exact wrong thing to do,&#8221; said Newton, who suggested that startups adopt &#8220;highly-curated&#8221; beta where they select customers instead of an open beta. &#8220;What you should be doing is trying to find a small handful, maybe even just one or two representative customers that you can really put your arms around and truly understand the needs of.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An agile process is important \u2014 but a successful venture also needs to integrate a sense of purpose into every aspect of its business, argued\u00a0John Bromley from <a href=\"https://chimp.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Chimp</a>, an online charitable marketplace.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I think of all the people who cope with all the difficulties and deal with the feedback and the constant failure in the entrepreneurial scene, it comes down to purpose. Whether you\u2019re an employee or running the show, if people have purpose, they are able to persevere because they are doing it for reasons that go well beyond just the task at hand,&#8221; said Bromley. &#8220;Know your purpose, link your personal purpose with your organizational purpose at the company that you work for, and ultimately get your paths aligned. And if there is no alignment, talk to someone and maybe you can find a better role. Even if you have to leave, it is better for you and much better for your company.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beyond purpose and processes lies the crossroads of company culture, an area that Tea Nicola from <a href=\"https://www.wealthbar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WealthBar</a> elaborated on from personal experience.\u00a0\u201cWhat makes a company culture, according to our employees, is a set of common values that drive your business, clients, and employees all together.\u201d</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cusbTwy3v50\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>For instance, transparency is\u00a0a very important value to WealthBar, and something they hold in high regard to maintain a strong culture. \u201cCurrently, everyone has complete transparency to everything in the company expect salaries, and I am actually working towards opening up salaries and equalizing things out so everybody will know where they can go,&#8221; said Nicola.</p>\n<p>Nicola succinctly described how culture is key to getting through the highs and lows of running a startup. &#8220;You need culture because when the going gets tough, the tough gets going, and when the tough gets going you need a reason to go. So when you have something other than the success of your company that drives your employees, you are able to keep going and pull through.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/techvan-april-millennials-controlling-the-future-and-how-to-do-better-beta-testing/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Seven reasons we&#8217;re excited for Startup Canada Day on the Hill</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/seven-reasons-were-excited-for-startup-canada-day-on-the-hill/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/seven-reasons-were-excited-for-startup-canada-day-on-the-hill/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2016 18:01:12 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[events]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[govt]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ottawa]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64903</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Startups are often so heads-down on product development and customer acquisition, they don&#8217;t have time to spare a thought about politics.

But as startups become a major source of employment for Canada&#8217;s growing tech sector, governments are thinking about them; from the federal government announcing an ambitious innovation agenda to scrapping the decision to tax stock options <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/startups/shopify-ceo-calls-on-ottawa-to-abandon-tax-plan-for-stock-options/article28801007/\" target=\"_blank\">due to entrepreneurial outcry</a>, it&#8217;s important that startups clearly, and uniformly, express what&#8217;s needed to build billion-dollar businesses in Canada. </p>\n<p>On May 5, Startup Canada is bringing 1,500 entrepreneurs, investors, and politicians together for <a href=\"http://www.startupday.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Canada Day on the Hill</a>. Throughout the jam-packed day, the events will help entrepreneurs gain insight into building their businesses \u2014 and will also help politicians learn what Canadian startups need to compete on a global scale. </p>\n<p>Here are seven reasons why we think you should be there:</p>\n<h4> 1. Members of Parliament want you to shape Canada&#8217;s innovation agenda </h4>\n<p>When the federal government revealed its budget, Navdeep Bains, the innovation, science, and economic development minister, said that <a href=\"http://betakit.com/innovation-minister-navdeep-bains-reveals-commitment-to-cleantech-and-holistic-approach-post-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">the government would continue</a> working with startups post-budget to outline the best way to support startups.  </p>\n<p>At Startup Canada Day on the Hill, startup founders and small business owners will get the chance to lay the foundation of Canada\u2019s innovation agenda through <a href=\"http://www.startupday.ca/#policy-hack-a-thon-agenda\" target=\"_blank\">policy hackathons</a>, <a href=\"http://www.startupday.ca/#canada-stage-agenda\" target=\"_blank\">growth talks</a>, <a href=\"http://www.startupday.ca/#cei-policy-hearings\" target=\"_blank\">policy hearings</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.startupday.ca/#canada-stage-agenda\" target=\"_blank\">panel discussions</a>. Members of Parliament will be on hand to hear your entrepreneurial approach to policy including Bill Morneau, Minister of Finance; Bardish Chagger, Minister of Small Business and Tourism; and the Patty Hajdu, Minister of Status of Women.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/25510694962_c07e56e1d9_k-2-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Small Business Minister Bardish Chagger\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-63019\" /></p>\n<h4>2. Startup heavyweights will share their thoughts on Canada&#8217;s next generation of startups</h4>\n<p>Canada\u2019s top entrepreneurs will be onsite to share their big-picture vision for Canada\u2019s future. Among Startup Canada Day on the Hill\u2019s keynote speakers are Tony Lacavera, founder of WIND Mobile and Globalive; Allen Lau, co-founder and CEO of WattPad; Waneek Horn-Miller, who received a gold medal at the 1999 Pan American Games and acts as a Manitobah Mukluks ambassador; and Robert Deluce, founder and CEO of Porter Airlines.</p>\n<h4>3. Global companies will be there to tell you how to build your startup</h4>\n<p>Top companies and disruptors like Uber, Facebook, Shopify, Intuit Quickbooks, UPS Canada, PayPal, and Microsoft Canada will be at Startup Canada Day on the Hill. You\u2019ll hear from them on-stage and have an opportunity to chat with them one-on-one during the Startup Soiree. </p>\n<h4>4. Get mentorship from Canada&#8217;s top entrepreneurs</h4>\n<p>At Startup Canada Day on the Hill, <a href=\"http://www.startupday.ca/#mentor-genius-lounge\" target=\"_blank\">hourly sessions with mentors</a> will be available to attendees in the Shaw Centre\u2019s Parliamentary Lounge. Receive mentorship on everything startup-related, from business modelling to marketing and sales to startup finance. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/photo_3-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Tony Lacavera\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-59376\" /></p>\n<h4>5. Low-key networking at the Startup Soiree and Marketplace </h4>\n<p>Featuring announcements, prizes, networking, startup exhibitors, food stations, and bars, Startup Canada Day on the Hill\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.startupday.ca/#startup-soiree-and-marketplace\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Soiree and Marketplace</a> is the opportunity to network with Canada&#8217;s Members of Parliament, ministers, and Canada\u2019s entrepreneurship community. </p>\n<h4>6. Connect with Canada\u2019s startup communities after the day is over </h4>\n<p>Every Startup Canada community from across the country will there\u2014from Startup Nanaimo to Startup Winnipeg to Startup Charlottetown.

And the market has gone from 0 percent internet connection to this year it will be 50 percent internet connected in terms of units sold. Most consumers look at it and say, why wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Croxon asked whether their decision to stay in Canada presented any challenges in scaling. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think Canada is a great place to build a business. When you go down to the Valley \u2014 and Canadian entrepreneurs should spend time there because it&#8217;s a different culture and there&#8217;s a lot of learning you can take out of there,&#8221; Lombard said. &#8220;But the market for talent in Silicon Valley is a lot more competitive. It costs a lot more to start a business. As a Canadian company, you should build your product here, and spend a lot of time and sales and marketing effort in the US because you really have to win in the US if you win at all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch the whole interview below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=859191&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a production partner on <a href=\"http://betakit.com/category/the-disruptors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Disruptors</a>.

Advertisers still rely on impressions \u2014 a metric that was adopted to digital advertising from print over twenty years ago \u2014 which measures who glances at a preview of content rather than their engagement. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When it comes to content where interaction happens post-click, impressions are irrelevant.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stackadapt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StackAdapt</a>, which recently raised <a href=\"http://betakit.com/stackadapt-raises-1-million-series-a-to-boost-native-advertising-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">a $1 million Series A</a> for its native advertising platform, announced that it&#8217;s moving away from the &#8220;outdated&#8221; impressions model. StackAdapt is moving on to cost-per-engagement pricing for its users, meaning that impressions are free, and advertisers are only required to pay when a user has engages with a piece of content for at least 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For brands that work with us, it&#8217;s all about relevant audiences engaging with their branded content. With attention-based pricing, we remove the risk of paying for what doesn&#8217;t move the needle for them,&#8221;<br />\nsaid StackAdapt co-founder Vitaly Pecherskiy. &#8220;While we assume the risk of users not spending time on content, we also price this attention-based bidding accordingly. Obviously, we make sure we don&#8217;t lose money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>StackAdapt\u2019s engagement-based pricing will allow advertisers to pay only for the users who read the content post-click, rather than paying based on who sees a sponsored post preview. According to Time, the average online attention span is <a href=\"http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/\" target=\"_blank\">eight to twelve seconds</a>; and StackAdapt defines engagement in 15-second increments. </p>\n<p>While brands are shifting away from interruptive forms of advertising in favour of content marketing, the majority of the paid distribution channels continue to adopt the same advertising pricing models \u2014 in the case of content marketing, impressions are irrelevant. &#8220;While impressions are certainly relevant for formats like video because the interaction with them happens on the impression level, when it comes to content where interaction happens post-click, impressions are irrelevant,&#8221; Pecherskiy said. &#8220;Why would you want to spend time producing great content just to be reduced to just a few sentence preview? If you create content, you want to have it read.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As StackAdapt is the first native advertising platform to move to this model, Pecherskiy said that other companies have been slower to move in this direction mostly due to a lack of awareness around engagement \u2014 eventually, he anticipates more brands expecting this model. &#8220;Many brands already buy media only on deeper engagement metrics like cost-per-click or based on user engagement, and we only anticipate that more will follow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are already some companies in our industry that think in this direction too. For example, there are clear indications that Facebook, with their Instant Article product, will soon offer something similar as well.&#8221; </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/stackadapt-adopts-cpe-model-as-advertising-struggles-to-keep-up-with-digital-content-consumption/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>#BKChats shows that culture wins in the fight for startup talent</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/bkchats-shows-that-culture-wins-in-the-fight-for-startup-talent/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/bkchats-shows-that-culture-wins-in-the-fight-for-startup-talent/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 21:30:10 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64868</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Last week, BetaKit teamed up with IPFS to address the burning question that every startup eventually has to face: how can we keep our...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Last week, BetaKit <a href=\"http://betakit.com/bkchats-how-can-startups-keep-great-talent/\" target=\"_blank\">teamed up</a> with <a href=\"http://ipfs.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">IPFS</a> to address the burning question that every startup eventually has to face: how can we keep our best and brightest talent as we scale and grow?</p>\n<p>Joined by Chris Gory, founder at Insurance Portfolio Financial Services, Liam Saunders, VP of Finance at Turnstyle Solutions, Kenny Goldman, Sales Operations Manager at Hired, and Jennifer Moss, co-founder at Plasticity Labs, #BKChats provides tips for startups to prepare for the <a href=\"http://betakit.com/cancon-podcast-ep-11-we-solve-canadas-startup-hiring-problem/\" target=\"_blank\">coming hiring crunch</a> in Canada.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the best of what they had to say.</p>\n<h3>Is compensation the biggest factor in retaining employees?</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetaKit\">@BetaKit</a> A2: False! 70% of our users don\u2019t take the highest offer they receive through Hired.

This information is separated by location and sector, which allows CCHIP to help planners, engineers, and decision makers account for future climate change impacts.</p>\n<blockquote><p> &#8220;Because of the fact that climate is increasingly non-static, it\u2019s important to be able to update and tailor analyses.\u201d\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>A few of the projects CCHIP has been involved in include work with municipalities to evaluate the capacity and management of stormwater drains to take runoff that flows off of lots and surfaces of cities; projections suggest increases the likelihood of extreme precipitation due to climate change. They\u2019ve also worked on evaluating whether buildings could withstand heavy loads of snow \u2014 and found many issues with it in Halifax. </p>\n<p>The tool can be invaluable to cash-strapped municipalities. \u201cOne of the big challenges especially for less well-resourced municipalities has been ensuring they or their consultants get access to the best climate information available and what this tool helps to do is to make it much more easily available and for certain levels of analyses to be done more easily,\u201d said Erik Sparling, director of climate risk decision support at Risk Sciences International. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do away with the need for them to have climatology or engineering expertise to look at this stuff once you have the answers, but it gets us further down the road in terms of access to critical data.\u201d</p>\n<p>The platform was designed around the needs of entities like National Model Building Code of Canada, the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, and design standards for overhead electricity transmission. With the platform, users can anticipate the impact of climate change on infrastructure and create resilient designs based on that information. The Ontario Centre for Climate Impacts and Adaptation Resources (OCCIAR) has already made an investment in CCHIP and will be applying the tool in its ongoing adaptation decision-support work.</p>\n<p>Sparling said that the current issue that CCHIP solves isn&#8217;t the fact that the data isn&#8217;t available; mostly, it&#8217;s the fact that the data can be difficult to interpret according to specific industries. He gives the example of Environment Canada&#8217;s national weather monitoring network. \u201cEnvironment Canada uses weather station data to develop climate statistics and is increasingly making available online a certain amount of climate change-related information, but for individual sectors, your climate change information needs are quite different across those different uses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because of the fact that climate is increasingly non-static, it\u2019s important to be able to update and tailor analyses that much more.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/ottawa-company-launches-platform-to-help-urban-planners-prepare-for-climate-change/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Women and Color launches to address underrepresentation of women and POC at tech events</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/women-and-color-launches-to-address-underrepresentation-of-women-and-poc-at-tech-events/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/women-and-color-launches-to-address-underrepresentation-of-women-and-poc-at-tech-events/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 15:14:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64715</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Thanks in large part to social media, the voices of women and people of colour calling out racism and sexism in many spheres of...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Thanks in large part to social media, the voices of women and people of colour calling out racism and sexism in many spheres of public life have been amplified. Between humorous resources like this Tumblr dedicated <a href=\"http://allmalepanels.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">to all male panel</a>s, to more in-depth pieces on the <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/black-woman-tech-industry/\" target=\"_blank\">repercussions of systemic racism and sexism</a> in daily life, it\u2019s almost impossible to be working in the tech space without being conscious of the fact that men are at a great advantage in every facet this space, including raising funding, representation, and even seemingly gender-blind issues like rates of <a href=\"https://peerj.com/preprints/1733/\" target=\"_blank\">acceptance rates of contributions</a> in open source projects. </p>\n<p>Mohammed Asaduallah, a product manager at <a href=\"https://format.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Format</a>, is one of many who have been affected by these conversations. \u201cI was becoming more aware of my privilege as a man, and part of it was working with many women who considered themselves feminists. And learning from them and being more educated and aware of issues that women come across especially in tech-related fields and jobs, day-to-day,\u201d Asaduallah said. \u201cThe other part of it was that I was starting to realize that I was underprivileged as a person of colour, so whether it was job opportunities or even <a href=\"http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/race-attraction-2009-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">dating</a>, I just found an overall lack of diversity in tech, especially in a multicultural city like Toronto, as a bit concerning and discomforting. These things led me to be more aware and be mindful of it but I wasn\u2019t sure how to go about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>These thoughts came to a head when Asaduallah looked at an event page that was in its early stages of being organized, led in part by someone he considered a feminist, figuring that the speakers would go beyond the usual white male roster that tends to dominate; while the speakers were half men and half women, there was only one POC. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a clear path to how Women and Color started, it was just a mixture of my environments and various touch points that triggered one thing after another.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI guess just in that moment it was like okay, this is it, I can\u2019t leave it someone else to advocate for diversity in tech especially in Toronto, and I can\u2019t have someone who will only advocate just for women\u2019s rights and not for women of colour,\u201d he said. The latter point seems to be an issue when discussing diversity in tech \u2014 often, organizers or hiring managers think the blanket goal of \u201chiring women\u201d is enough to address the issue of representation. However, white women are <a href=\"http://ideas.time.com/2013/06/17/affirmative-action-has-helped-white-women-more-than-anyone/\" target=\"_blank\">often the beneficiaries of these diversity initiatives</a>, leaving out other marginalized groups that intersect race and gender. </p>\n<p>Working with Format developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lauradegroot\" target=\"_blank\">Laura DeGroot</a> \u2014 whom Asaduallah describes as one of the many feminists he\u2019s learned from \u2014 the duo have launched <a href=\"http://womenandcolor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Women and Color</a>\u2019s online directory, which has launched as a small step towards alleviating the lack of representation in tech conferences. Speakers on the directory that identify as women and/or people of colour can sign up according to their area of expertise, and the directory is separated according to topic, such as brand strategy, product management, and development. </p>\n<p>Before the launch of the directory, he initially started out by tweeting the often dismal statistics around the demographics of tech conferences through his personal Twitter account, then realized that the stats he was tweeting about could apply to many others tech conferences \u2014 which he then dedicated to creating the <a href=\"http://www.womenandcolor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Women and Color</a> official <a href=\"https://twitter.com/womenandcolor\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter </a>account. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a clear path to how Women and Color started, it was just a mixture of my environments and various touch points that triggered one thing after another, and that event and speaker list was the final straw for me before I felt I needed to do something,\u201d Asaduallah said. </p>\n<p>Asaduallah said that one of the common excuses that he hears from event organizers is that they looked but just \u201ccouldn\u2019t find\u201d women or POC \u2014 often, the issue comes from organizers reaching out to their networks or circle, which is likely mostly white and/or male. \u201cThey\u2019re already going the convenience route, and once they\u2019ve reached out to their networks they realize that there aren\u2019t enough women or enough POC, and they need to fix this,\u201d he said, adding that \u2018fixing\u2019 the issue often just entails sending a few tweets or updating their event page without actively reaching out. \u201cThen they say \u2018Oh, we tried\u2019, but we didn\u2019t find women or POC because we couldn\u2019t find them. That\u2019s generally one of the issues or excuses that I hear.\u201d</p>\n<p>While this has only launched as an online resource for now \u2014 and only features speakers in the Toronto area \u2014 Asaduallah hopes that the work of Women and Color goes beyond the directory and turns into a community. He\u2019s launched a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/womenandcolor\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook group</a> to go with the resource. \u201cI would like to have Women and Color become a platform to provide support for women and POC because I don\u2019t want to limit this to a directory, I want to shape this and grow this further.\u201d</p>\n<p>A resource like this doesn\u2019t completely remove the systemic issues that create a community that lacks adequate representation of women and POC in tech in the first place. There are countless studies on the barriers facing women and people of colour in tech, including the fact that women often have to <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/10/hacking-techs-diversity-problem\" target=\"_blank\">provide more evidence of competence</a> than men and are seen as bossy where men are seen as assertive, and people of colour \u2014 especially women of colour \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-13/code-of-silicon-valley-minority-you-can-t-be-angry-\" target=\"_blank\">fear backlash for speaking out</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allison-scott/diversity-data-shows-need_b_5571685.html\" target=\"_blank\">lack diverse mentors or access to resources</a> due to negative stereotypes about their background. As many have pointed out, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mustefaJ/the-commoditization-of-diversity-60160205c05f\" target=\"_blank\">this issue of representation goes beyond</a> just having women and POC represented at events, with the ever-present risk of their tokenization. </p>\n<p>At the very least, though, it\u2019s a step to further ensuring that the phrase \u201cthere are no women and POC tech speakers&#8221; remains an outdated excuse.

Perhaps you\u2019ve got an appetite for learning how to forage for wild culinary delicacies in the hinterland of BC\u2019s Lower Mainland, or want to midline your way high above the treetops. A new Vancouver-based startup, <a href=\"https://guiides.com/\">Guiides.com</a>, helps adventurers find truly unique experiences that are a bit more intense than your usual tourist fare. Backed with $1 million in early funding, the support of Canadian outfitter Mountain Equipment Co-op, and some adrenaline-fueled enthusiasm, they aim to make their platform a gateway to incredible experiences across the globe. It\u2019s the latest outdoor-themed startup from <a href=\"https://shareshed.ca/\">Shareshed</a> founder Daniel Dubois.</p>\n<p>The platform is about making it easy to book real adventures with experienced adventure guides, Dubois says. \u201cFrom the point of view of someone searching for these kinds of experiences online, it can be really hard to find these kinds of guides, since they can just get lost in Google search,\u201d he says. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It\u2019s always a challenge to consolidate an archaic industry. It\u2019s highly fragmented. The challenge is connecting with all of these companies and providing value to them.&#8221; &#8211; Daniel Dubois\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many experienced guides, even ones that have been around for some time, may just want to focus on delivering the adventures, but not have the inclination or ability to promote themselves effectively in a saturated digital marketplace (\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for them to still be running old HTML websites,\u201d he notes). From the service provider side, the benefit is getting on a curated platform where they don\u2019t really have to handle online business development; adventurous folks can just book particular adventure promotions and Guiides.com takes a straight 15 percent cut off the top, including credit card payment fees).</p>\n<p>The startup seems a perfect fit for a tech hub ensconced in \u201c<a href=\"http://www.hellobc.com/\">Super, Natural British Columbia</a>\u201d but the youthful Dubois has big plans, inspired by trips abroad where he got to explore the great outdoors. \u201cA friend encouraged me to take a year off and go traveling, and we ended up in Australia. I moved into a garage, went surfing, and just enjoyed hanging out with neighbours and his family. It was truly a local experience where I could feel a sense of belonging.\u201d Later, while researching the sharing economy, he realized there was an opportunity to give more people access to these kinds of experiences with a platform that takes away the friction of getting outside, \u201cwhere you don\u2019t need to worry about gear or transportation and can just get to live like a local.\u201d That means going beyond usual tourist fare like bus tours and package trips that cater to the vast majority of tourists. \u201cSince we\u2019re launching in Vancouver, that means looking beyond a trip to Capilano Suspension Bridge and getting a bit more creative, with ideas like sunrise yoga or sunset paddle boarding.</p>\n<p>Scaling up the business to a global audience after the test case on the west coast will be the real challenge, Dubois notes. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-sided marketplace. We need to build supply and demand together. Each area we operate in is a silo in itself. There\u2019s no point in having a ton of demand if our only place we\u2019re serving is Vancouver. We want low customer acquisition cost but high customer value,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It\u2019s always a challenge to consolidate an archaic industry. It\u2019s highly fragmented. The challenge is connecting with all of these companies and providing value to them.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/guiides-connects-adventurous-travelers-with-experiences-off-the-beaten-path/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Hack to Start Ep. 94: Made By Many managing partner Leslie Bradshaw</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/hack-to-start-ep-94-made-by-many-managing-partner-leslie-bradshaw/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/hack-to-start-ep-94-made-by-many-managing-partner-leslie-bradshaw/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 18:51:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Franco Varriano]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[entrepreneur]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64799</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[This week\u2019s guest is Leslie Bradshaw, the managing partner at Made By Many, a product innovation studio.

From MIT engineers to smaller <a href=\"http://betakit.com/university-of-waterloo-team-one-of-only-22-testing-prototype-on-spacexs-hyperloop-track/\" target=\"_blank\">student engineering teams</a>, the global effort shows that anyone is fair game to create a transportation method that could have a profound effect on our ideas of transportation.</p>\n<p>Toronto-based <a href=\"http://www.transpod.ca/\">Transpod</a>, a startup dedicated entirely to creating a hyperloop, is one of these startups that are leading the charge. Transpod currently has a half-scale prototype, and intends to present a full-scale concept at the InnoTrans Rail Show in Berlin. Sebastien Gendron, the founder and CEO of Transpod, describes the company\u2019s ambitious timeline: Transpod plans to work for two years with industry partners before moving on to governments and municipalities, including entities like Transport Canada, to have approval to build a line between 2020-2025. With at notable experience working in the transportation industry under his belt \u2014 he&#8217;s held positions like flight operations manager at Airbus and project manager at Bombardier Aerospace \u2014 his confidence in the possibility of the hyperloop isn&#8217;t surprising.</p>\n<p>While he isn&#8217;t specifically looking to build in Canada first, he is interested in building a line between Toronto and Montreal if he were to build here. </p>\n<p>Gendron argues that building the Hyperloop isn&#8217;t as futuristic of a concept as people think it is, because the system is just a hybrid between an aircraft and a train. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so different that regular players like Bombardier and Boeing won\u2019t take the risk to start doing it, so there\u2019s room for a startup company to work on it.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really the way we put it together which can make it work. So a tube in a low pressure environment which can allow the vehicle to move in frictionless environment, that\u2019s one of the items needed to reach those speeds, and all of the technical components of that mode of transport already exist,\u201d he said. \u201cLike the cabin, the cabin will have to be pressurized like an aircraft. So all the systems are existing today, it\u2019s just a matter of putting them in a different vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Transpod has an academic collaboration with the University of Toronto\u2019s Institute of for Multidisciplinary Design and Innovation, as well as a corporate partnership with REC Canada.  He iterates that the biggest challenge is not simply building the thing \u2014 it\u2019s selling the benefits of the hyperloop to people who aren\u2019t familiar with its long-term benefits. </p>\n<p>\u201cEven today, people are looking for innovative transportation systems. So I expect those needs to help us overcome those challenges,\u201d he said, adding that it also should prove to have economic benefits for governments that are keen on creating jobs. \u201cWhat we would like people to understand is that tomorrow if you\u2019re capable of connecting two huge cities together that are 30 minutes away from each other, it\u2019s a huge economic advantage to shrink distance and time.\u201d</p>\n<p>The infrastructure industry in the past has been dominated by major transportation organizations that have the resources to undertake such large-scale projects. The hyperloop, with an almost sci-fi feeling to it, presents an opportunity for agile startups to change the way we think about transportation. \u201cIt\u2019s so different that regular players like Bombardier and Boeing won\u2019t take the risk to start doing it so there\u2019s room for a startup company to work on that,\u201d said Gendron. \u201cI took the challenge and decided to do it.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/transpod-wants-to-bring-its-canadian-made-hyperloop-to-the-world/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>MaRS adds Square to its roster of FinTech partners</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/mars-adds-square-to-its-roster-of-fintech-partners/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/mars-adds-square-to-its-roster-of-fintech-partners/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 14:00:51 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64739</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Last year, MaRS launched its FinTech cluster to address the need for FinTech startups and financial institutions to work together.

When you\u2019re a startup founder, these stressors are placed solely on your shoulders. Being the leader means receiving pats on the back when you succeed, but when you fail, the responsibility is yours and yours alone.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise then that <a href=\"https://foundrmag.com/mental-illness-and-entrepreneurship/\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneurs self-report on mental health conditions</a>, such as depression and substance abuse, more often than the general public does. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.startupgrind.com/blog/genius-in-madness-72-of-entrepreneurs-affected-by-mental-health-conditions/\" target=\"_blank\">72% of entrepreneurs report</a> being affected by mental health conditions, and a third of them claim to be affected by two or more issues. With awareness about mental illness becoming more prevalent in our personal and professional lives, a new level of understanding is going a long way in making a dent in these issues, and new programs are helping startup founders and their employees stay healthy, both mentally and physically.</p>\n<h3>The Founder Blues</h3>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s no surprise that entrepreneurs self-report on mental health conditions, such as depression and substance abuse, more often. A startup can feel like a pressure cooker.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A startup can feel like a pressure cooker, and those stressors are making \u201cstartup depression\u201d or \u201cfounder\u2019s blues\u201d all too common. The pressure of running a company, the personal nature of your business failures, and a constant state of uncertainty can lead to intense anxiety. A founder\u2019s once-passionate perspective can transform into an unstable frame of mind &#8211; obsessive thoughts, cycles of withdrawal and engagement, and low self-worth. All these factors, compounded by stress, isolation, long work hours, and lack of self-care <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/amymorin/2015/03/24/theres-a-hidden-dark-side-to-being-an-entrepreneur-it-wreaks-havoc-on-your-mental-health/#1b7ddb10404c\" target=\"_blank\">can lead to depression</a>. </p>\n<p>Stories of startup founders quietly suffering are more commonly leading to shocking suicides. Last year Austen Heinz, a biotech entrepreneur and founder of Cambrian Genomics, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/austen-heinzs-suicide-and-depression-in-startups-2015-7\" target=\"_blank\">took his own life</a> after struggling with depression. In 2013, two high-profile suicides rocked the community within weeks of each other: Aaron Swartz, co-founder of Reddit, and Jody Sherman, founder of Ecomom, both took their own lives &#8211; at the time of their deaths Swartz was under indictment for data theft, while Sherman\u2019s startup had recently failed. While these cases are devastating, they\u2019ve opened up the discussion on mental health issues and forced the startup ecosystem to examine the pressures founders face daily.</p>\n<h3>Self-care trends</h3>\n<p>To combat these worrying trends, we\u2019re seeing an emergence of programs that legitimize newer concepts such as fatigue management and preventative healthcare. The most progressive companies take care of their employees to remain competitive in attracting talent, but now even more traditional workplaces are exploring the link between an employee\u2019s physical and mental health and a company\u2019s bottom line. It\u2019s well-documented that having a team of healthy workers means <a href=\"http://www.benefitscanada.com/benefits/health-benefits/employers-tweaking-corporate-health-plans-to-appeal-to-millennial-workers-76870\" target=\"_blank\">increased productivity and decreased absenteeism</a>, as well as less costly drug and long-term disability claims down the road.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://betakit.com/has-your-startup-thought-about-employee-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\">rise of Millennial workers</a> is also driving the demand for more complete healthcare. These employees want options such as naturopathic medicine, mental health counselling, fitness subsidiaries, and innovative Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) to be brought into benefits packages, often via apps and on-demand services. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Start-Up-Desk-EventBrite.png\" alt=\"TranQool\" width=\"2160\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64647\" /></p>\n<h3>What\u2019s an EAP?</h3>\n<p>Employee Assistance Programs are on-demand counselling services available through a number of platforms. An EAP can be designed to assist in matters including marital and family issues, substance abuse and addiction, anxiety and depression, and extreme stress. </p>\n<p>They solve many of the traditional roadblocks faced when someone is searching for help with mental health. A there-when-you-need-it service, EAPs are low-commitment, time-saving, judgement-free and completely anonymous. They\u2019re also less costly than traditional insurance options, <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/30874\" target=\"_blank\">saving companies 20-30%</a> on their mental health claims, with many costing only a few dollars per month per employee. North American businesses have seen a 7% increase in the use of EAPs and corporate wellness services, and this trend is continuing to grow among companies both interested in preserving their bottom line, and keeping their offerings cutting-edge to attract talent in competitive fields. </p>\n<p>Interestingly, many of the companies that will lessen startup depression are startups themselves. <a href=\"https://tranqool.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TranQool</a>, a Toronto-based EAP that launched recently, allows users to connect with trained and licensed therapists via video chat.

But with the rise of cloud adoption, developers are creating new web applications faster while grappling new challenges in cybersecurity. Simply put, today&#8217;s agile development processes and complex technology architectures mean that addressing security issues and vulnerabilities can&#8217;t be done fast enough. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.immun.io/\" target=\"_blank\">IMMUNIO</a>, a Montreal-based cybersecurity startup, is hoping to change the way companies think about their security processes. The company develops a runtime application software protection (RASP), which can flag vulnerabilities within the app and immediately block attacks in real time, allowing both developers and IT operations teams to understand where the vulnerability was, how it was blocked and what the steps are to fix it. This morning, IMMUNIO raised a $5 million Series A in a round led by White Star Capital, a transatlantic venture fund operating between London, New York, and Montreal, and previous seed round investors.</p>\n<p>This round brings IMMUNIO&#8217;s total funding to date to $8.3 million. IMMUNIO says that its RASP offering provides the same vulnerability identification benefits as static and dynamic scanners on one hand, and the protection features of web application firewalls (WAF) on the other, while remaining simpler to deploy and operate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are bringing to market a solution that is redefining how we think about web application security and have already seen significant traction. This round of investment, along with strong additions to the management team, gives us the resources to accelerate our growth rapidly to meet the ongoing needs of today&#8217;s cloud environment,&#8221; said Zaid Al Hamami, CEO and co-founder of IMMUNIO. &#8220;Cloud has brought such incredible advancements in the speed at which we build applications, and with hundreds of millions of applications on the web today, a huge portion are vulnerable. RASP allows for real-time protection while uniting the development and IT operation teams in their efforts to ensure applications are running smoothly and securely.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the same time, the company announced new additions to their management team, including Goran Begic as vice president of Product and Richard April as chief marketing officer. Begic previously led product management at Veracode, while April boasts 20 years of experience at startups, early stage, and growth companies in the cloud, mobile, security, and SaaS/software industries.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/immunio-raises-5-million-series-a-to-disrupt-web-app-security/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Tony Lacavera says Canada can be a leader in quantum computing at Canadian Club Toronto panel</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/three-tech-leaders-on-the-benefits-of-scaling-in-canada/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/three-tech-leaders-on-the-benefits-of-scaling-in-canada/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2016 18:24:47 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64719</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Canadian founders aren\u2019t shy about expressing the fact that Canada is a great place to grow a business; with business support programs like the...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Canadian founders aren\u2019t shy about expressing the fact that <a href=\"http://betakit.com/venture-north-answers-age-old-question-why-invest-and-grow-in-canada/\" target=\"_blank\">Canada is a great place to grow a business</a>; with business support programs like the SR&#038;ED tax credit and cheaper operation costs in comparison to the US, Canada\u2019s startup community has grown immensely both in size and influence over just a few years.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIf you look at the here and now, network of funders and entrepreneurs, of first-time founders, of support infrastructure and teams, here and now is dramatic.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, there\u2019s no denying the issue of brain drain, as Canada\u2019s startup ecosystem competes with powerhouses like Silicon Valley, which has had decades to build itself up and provides <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/technology/trudeaus-troubled-vision-why-tech-wont-save-canadas-economy/\" target=\"_blank\">attractive opportunities for young grads</a> looking for higher pay in US dollars. At an event hosted by <a href=\"https://www.canadianclub.org/AboutUs.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Club Toronto</a>, three tech leaders \u2014 Wattpad CEO Allen Lau, Globalive CEO Tony Lacavera, and Nudge and Eloqua founder Steve Woods \u2014 sat with journalist Amber Mac to find out what it took for them to build companies in Canada.</p>\n<p>Woods said that, compared to 15 years ago, the climate for building businesses in Canada today is astonishing. \u201cIf you look at the here and now, the network of funders, entrepreneurs, and first-time founders, and support infrastructure and teams, here and now is dramatic,\u201d said Woods.  </p>\n<p>Lau, who just today announced <a href=\"http://betakit.com/wattpad-launches-multi-channel-network-to-co-produce-wattpad-stories-for-film/\" target=\"_blank\">the launch of Wattpad Studios</a>, talked about the benefits of scaling in a city like Toronto, and the reasons why Toronto&#8217;s talent pool is particularly unique. \u201cNumber one is diversity. Fifty-one percent of the population in Toronto is born outside Toronto,\u201d said Lau. \u201cIf you want to build a global business, I can\u2019t find a better place to do it. and the other thing that we have is that this is a great place to live. Consistently, we rank high among other cities around the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Continuing to speak on a more national level, Lacavera highlighted key areas where Canada is making gains. While Canadian cities may not have had as much time as the Valley to mature as startups ecosystems, up-and-coming technologies like virtual reality provide an opportunity for Canada to be leaders.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hugely excited about the quantum computer,\u201d Lacavera said, citing the Vancouver-based D-Wave Systems as an example of a Canadian company leading in this space. \u201cThis is a Canadian company that I think will change the world, and I think Canada is 10 years ahead in quantum computing. We have to now invest heavily and maintain that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lacavera continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one area where we\u2019re leaders, but I think it\u2019s useful to talk about what our strengths are. I think it can apply to a range of companies, and I don\u2019t think we need to be number one. But quantum computing would be nice.\u201d </p>\n<p>But to make that happen, the panel agreed that the government, incubators, and accelerators need to continue supporting the momentum that&#8217;s currently happening with startups.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the one way we can continue to build on the ecosystem is by allowing young entrepreneurs to really take a shot, and giving young entrepreneurs a platform,\u201d said Lacavera. \u201cWhen we started, there was no such environment or support system here. That doesn&#8217;t mean everyone will do something useful, there\u2019s still going to be just as many failures, but we have to invest in that ecosystem.&#8221;\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/three-tech-leaders-on-the-benefits-of-scaling-in-canada/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Wattpad launches multi-channel network to co-produce Wattpad stories for film</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/wattpad-launches-multi-channel-network-to-co-produce-wattpad-stories-for-film/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/wattpad-launches-multi-channel-network-to-co-produce-wattpad-stories-for-film/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2016 15:59:21 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Launches]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64705</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[With 45 million unique users and an average of 30 minutes of engagement within its mobile app, Wattpad has established itself as a strong...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>With 45 million unique users and an average of 30 minutes of engagement within its mobile app, <a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wattpad </a>has established itself as a strong force in print that&#8217;s weathered the storm of digital disruption. </p>\n<p>And the company has indicated that it&#8217;s ready to take this loyal community of writers and readers to the next frontier of content creation; Wattpad announced that it&#8217;s launching Wattpad Studios, which will operate as a multi-channel network (MCN) and will partner with the entertainment industry to co-produce Wattpad stories for print, film, television, and digital platforms. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We can easily spot the voices that resonate with audiences around the world and the stories that have an established fan base.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Aron Levitz, who acted as Wattpad&#8217;s head of business development in the past, will take the helm as head of Wattpad Studios.\u00a0In his role as head of business development, Levitz <a href=\"http://betakit.com/wattpad-is-your-brands-last-best-hope-for-native-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\">was instrumental to securing partnerships</a> like Sony Pictures, which used Wattpad to promote its Pride and Prejudice movie, and General Electric, which commissioned Wattpad writers to write stories on its 50s comic book covers. </p>\n<p>\u201cWattpad deals exclusively in the one thing that powers the billion-dollar entertainment industry &#8211; original and compelling stories,\u201d said Head of Wattpad Studios Aron Levitz. \u201cAs the largest and fastest-growing platform for stories, we can easily spot the voices that resonate with audiences around the world and the stories that have an established fan base. Wattpad Studios will help industry executives make smarter decisions, faster.\u201d</p>\n<p>In his role, Levitz will connect the entertainment and publishing industries with original content created by <a href=\"http://betakit.com/wattpad-introduces-wattpad-stars-accelerator-for-viral-writers/\" target=\"_blank\">Wattpad Stars</a>, the biggest influencers on the platform chosen by the global Wattpad community. </p>\n<p>Other initiatives under Wattpad Studios include Wattpad Words, which helps publishers connect with readers and test story ideas by gathering real-time reader feedback; Wattpad Presents, a partnership with networks and producers to adapt Wattpad stories for television; and Wattpad Insights, which allows executives to subscribe to trend reports that identify and analyze the types of content that are trending on the platform. Executives using the platform can also access IP reports that identify the top trending IP on Wattpad and hidden gems curated by Wattpad\u2019s team.</p>\n<p>Wattpad is already at work with Wattpad Presents, as it has partnered with TV5 Network in the Philippines. TV5 has produced 200 episodes representing 40 Wattpad stories.</p>\n<p>The company says that this will usher in a new method of monetization for writers&#8217; stories, as online writers now have the opportunity to receive commissioned work from major brands. \u201cEntertainment and Wattpad stories go hand-in-hand. It\u2019s why millions of people around the world spend 15 billion minutes a month on the platform,\u201d said Wattpad Co-Founder and CEO Allen Lau. \u201cThe launch of Wattpad Studios will not only extend the reach of Wattpad stories, but will also help shape the future of community and data-driven entertainment.\u201d </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/wattpad-launches-multi-channel-network-to-co-produce-wattpad-stories-for-film/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Startup Canada Podcast: Wattpad&#8217;s Allen Lau on the importance of perseverance</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/startup-canada-podcast-wattpads-allen-lau-on-the-importance-of-perseverance/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/startup-canada-podcast-wattpads-allen-lau-on-the-importance-of-perseverance/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2016 15:37:44 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Startup Canada]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64706</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[While serial entrepreneur Allen Lau knows first-hand how difficult it can be to build a startup, he also knows how rewarding the lessons brought...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>While serial entrepreneur Allen Lau knows first-hand how difficult it can be to build a startup, he also knows how rewarding the lessons brought with the highs \u2014 and the lows \u2014 can be. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe number-one thing that stops people from starting a business is hesitation,\u201d says Lau. \u201cIf you can overlook this, you can enjoy the journey. Many startups will fail, and it\u2019s only natural, and it\u2019s actually okay. The lessons that you learn through success and failure will be life-changing.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lau is the co-founder and CEO of Wattpad, a Toronto-based social story sharing app that connects readers and writers from around the world. Wattpad users can access multimedia stories from a variety of genres. If users can\u2019t find exactly what they\u2019re looking for, the app gives them the power to write and share that story themselves. </p>\n<p>In this episode of Startup Canada Podcast, host Rivers Corbett chats with Lau, who is also an angel investor, about the keys to startup success, why Canada is the best place to start a business, and the importance of perseverance in the face of startup hardships.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/260929692&#038;color=e21836\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.startupcan.ca/podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\">The Startup Canada Podcast Show</a> is a production of Startup Canada, a grassroots, entrepreneur-led movement to bring together, celebrate, and give a voice to Canada\u2019s entrepreneurship community.

He has been in BC area since the late 90s. Because of that, he has a rich history on a bunch of different cities and businesses.</p>\n<p>Before diving into Don&#8217;s impressive resum\u00e9, we chat briefly about education, the new era of boot camps, as well as the stigma coming from some of the traditional educational institutions.</p>\n<p>If there was a competition about who is the most passionate and hardest working instructor, Don would definitely be an outstanding choice. Just listening to his story of getting started with Lighthouse Labs, it really shows how dedicated Don is to teaching others and expanding the community.</p>\n<p>Due to the fact that Don has been in the BC area for so long, he has a great origin story.

But for large hardware companies that sell products like office printers, alternative methods of gaining revenue like charging a per-page fee instead of a one-time price is more viable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://teabot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TeaBot</a> co-founder Rehman Merali spoke at TechToronto a few weeks ago to share how his company found success with their self-serve tea kiosk by using the latter model. When Merali and his co-founder started out, they approached real estate agents and offered to install the bot for free and write a cheque to them based on the revenue. He says it&#8217;s not about selling the bot, he says, but it&#8217;s about selling a high quality tea. &#8220;The recurring revenue model is inherent. Like the razorblade model, we&#8217;re selling a consumable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merali said that with this model, companies can get their product to market faster, &#8220;Compared to the other companies that are constantly iterating before they put it in their customer&#8217;s hands, we put our early prototypes out before they were finished,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those early prototypes are now retired but we still sold our product because our product is tea, not the bot.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch the whole talk, including some of the cons of this model, below:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qVy208Tq2po\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/teabots-rehman-merali-says-hardware-companies-dont-sell-hardware/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>F&#124;T: The FinTech Times &#8211; VC appetites</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/ft-the-fintech-times-vc-appetites/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/ft-the-fintech-times-vc-appetites/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 23:14:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Douglas Soltys]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64666</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the FinTech Times, a weekly newsletter covering the biggest FinTech news from around the globe.

Today, the Department of Canadian Heritage has launched the first phase of consultations on Canadian content in a digital world.</p>\n<p>The first phase of these consultations involves answering an online questionnaire regarding the role of local content in Canadian life. The survey gives respondents the option to answer as either a consumer or a creator of Canadian media.</p>\n<p>According to the Honourable M\u00e9lanie Joly, Minister of Canadian Heritage, the future of Canada\u2019s growth and prosperity lies in the intersection of technology and innovation.</p>\n<p>In a statement sent to MobileSyrup, the Minister went on to say that \u201cCanadian consumers and content creators are at the core of the cultural sector, and this is why we strongly believe in the importance of consulting Canadians across the country to help us shape this process.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Department of Canadian Heritage went on to outline several reasons why it\u2019s in the government\u2019s best interest to promote Canadian content to new markets. The first of these is that the line between content creators and content consumers has blurred substantially.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, not only has an interconnected world made it easier for local content to get buried, but an unwavering access to free content has changed Canadians\u2019 expectations for local availability.</p>\n<p>According to the statement from Minister Joly, the government is hoping to use the questionnaire to examine the current policy toolkit for navigating the digital world and provide a foundation for the next phase of consultations, to begin in summer 2016.</p>\n<p>She goes on to say that the cultural sector of the Canadian economy is crucial to expanding Canada\u2019s role internationally.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis project is driven by our belief that the time is ripe to review the role of the federal government in helping Canada\u2019s creative sector navigate this transformation and chart a course to ensure that we are poised to position ourselves as global leaders.\u201d</p>\n<p>Those who wish to respond can take the quiz <a href=\"http://pch.sondages-surveys.ca/s/dwc/?l=en\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/25/canadian-government-launches-questionnaire-to-improve-local-content/\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/federal-government-shaping-strategy-to-promote-canadian-content-worldwide-as-digital-takes-over/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Cubbyspot removing the headache from daycare wait times on #TheDisruptors</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/cubbyspot-removing-the-headache-from-daycare-wait-times-on-thedisruptors/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/cubbyspot-removing-the-headache-from-daycare-wait-times-on-thedisruptors/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 20:05:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Disruptors]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[mobile]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64644</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[When it comes to finding daycare services in major cities like Toronto, many parents share the same complaints \u2014 finding a high-quality daycare is...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>When it comes to finding daycare services in major cities like Toronto, many parents share the same complaints \u2014 finding a high-quality daycare is <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/life/parent/2010/02/05/daycare_in_toronto_is_expensive_and_hard_to_find.html\" target=\"_blank\">both expensive and time-consuming</a>. </p>\n<p>One Toronto-based startup pitching on <em>The Disruptors</em> is hoping to solve at least one of these issues. <a href=\"http://www.cubbyspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cubbyspot</a>&#8216;s mobile platform connects parents and daycares to fill vacancies more efficiently. Parents have the ability to sign up through a preferred location and receive notifications about daycare availability through their phone, while daycares can more easily manage their waitlist through the platform. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Across Canada we have 12,000 listings, but we do have 30 daycare partners based in Toronto where you can use the app to sign up and find open spots,&#8221; said Regnard Raquedan, founder of CubbySpot. &#8220;Right now, finding a daycare spot is very hard for a parent. Three years ago when my wife and I were looking for daycare, it took us months to find an opening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While co-host Bruce Croxon said there are enough daycare listing services, he said CubbySpot&#8217;s ability to send notifications when spots are available are the most interesting aspect of the business. &#8220;It&#8217;s saving time from calling back and waiting desperately for that spot,&#8221; he said. </p>\n<p>Watch the whole pitch below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=854695&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a production partner on <a href=\"http://betakit.com/category/the-disruptors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Disruptors</a>.

The agreement, which is part of Waze&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.waze.com/ccp\" target=\"_blank\">Connected Citizens Program</a>, will call for two-way data sharing of publicly available traffic information within Ville-Marie borough using Waze.</p>\n<p>The news was announced by Aref Salem, member of the city&#8217;s executive committee in charge of transportation; Harout Chitilian, vice-chair of the city&#8217;s executive committee and member in charge of smart city initiatives; and Lionel Perez, who is in charge of infrastructures on the executive committee. </p>\n<p>&#8220;As part of this innovative partnership, the participatory information of Waze users will help to fuel the city&#8217;s Centre de gestion de la mobilit\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al (CGMU). By obtaining real-time data, the city wants to improve its reactivity to traffic jams, accidents or other incidents on the road and minimize the impact on drivers. Montr\u00e9al is the first city in Canada to use Waze data, and if the project is conclusive, we plan to extend its deployment across the city,&#8221; said Salem.</p>\n<p>The city will make its planned traffic obstruction data available to Waze, while Waze will provide the city with real-time, anonymous, Waze-generated incident and slow-down information generated from its platform. The <a href=\"http://www1.ville.montreal.qc.ca/banque311/content/centre-de-gestion-de-la-mobilit%C3%A9-urbaine-cgmu\" target=\"_blank\">CGMU</a>, a series of street surveillance cameras that help the city manage traffic in real time and encourage communication between its partner control centres, is supposed to be one of the city&#8217;s initiatives expected to receive the benefit. The city said that as unplanned incidents arise, instantaneous information sharing becomes crucial \u2014 the latter being Waze&#8217;s specialty, as it collects real-time traffic and road condition information through its community. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This year, there will be a number of major construction projects in Ville-Marie. This pilot project is a concrete illustration of initiatives to facilitate road travel for users when there are obstructions to traffic,&#8221; said Perez. In Montreal, Waze has 103,000 monthly active users in Montr\u00e9al who drive more than  19 million kilometres each month with the app. In December alone, they reported nearly 250,000 incidents. </p>\n<p>This project is one of 70 projects in the Montr\u00e9al Smart and Digital City 2015 Action Plan.

The fact is, in the last five years, there&#8217;s been more fragmentation than there has been in the last fifty years,&#8221; said Toering.</p>\n<p>Kanwar ended off wondering what Toering&#8217;s predictions were for the media landscape in the next five years. &#8220;The biggest thing now is that it&#8217;s not going to get any easier than it is now. Consumers are driving everything in the end. Millennials in Canada are $70 billion in consumer spending and close to 30 percent of the population, how do we reach them?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Traditionally, TV provided us this incredible platform to drive the broadest reach and control frequency.

Meng started off his career as a self-taught graphic designer who transitioned to digital work. </p>\n<p>Wanting to move to San Francisco to learn from some of the best designers in the world &#8211; designers who were passionate about solving problems &#8211;  Meng managed to stay for a year until his visa expired and he could no longer continue to work. His dreams were crushed. </p>\n<p>With nothing left to lose, and at a crossroad in his career, he set out to travel the world. He soon decided to launch a product while on his adventure. Having started to blog about a new app called Sketch, Meng quickly settled on teaching others how to design with it, and then how to bring those same designs to life through quick prototypes using xcode.

Users can search through rentals online, book, and pay rent through the Casalova platform. Casalova hires professionals photographers to take photos of each space, and syndicates the information both on Casalova and partner sites. </p>\n<p>For landlords, Casalova&#8217;s team of data scientists and machine learning specialists provide landlords with a tenant risk score, which lets landlords know if their tenants are high risk. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Casalova is a real estate platform that&#8217;s transforming the rental marketplace through technology,&#8221; said Ray Taeeb, co-founder of Casalova. </p>\n<p>Co-host Amber Kanwar said she felt cautious about the service, as she felt it creates a middleman rather than streamlining the rental process. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s still very engrained in people that they still go to realtors for this sort of thing, I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s really that much more convenient to actually search on the web for the place you&#8217;re going to live.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the flip side, co-host Bruce Croxon disagreed. &#8220;This particular industry is lagging behind, property managers had their fiefdoms that they were trying to hold on to, and technology was bad news for them,&#8221; Croxon said. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a market opportunity here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch the whole pitch below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=854694&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a production partner on <a href=\"http://betakit.com/category/the-disruptors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Disruptors</a>.

On the busiest days, making a to-do list is hailed as the best way to get things done. However, what this actually results in is an impossibly long list of chores that rewards the little tasks instead of the big ones.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, an app was released by developer Nick Burka to challenge the to-do list. He claims that <a href=\"http://www.onebigthing.co/\" target=\"_blank\">One Big Thing</a> is used to help users achieve the most important task of the day, and worry about the smaller things later.</p>\n<p>Nick Burka is the twin brother of Daniel Burka, the former creative director at Digg.com and currently a partner at Google Ventures. The brothers are originally from Prince Edward Island and co-founded the design agency <a href=\"http://www.silverorange.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Silverorange</a> in 1999.</p>\n<p>John Zeratsky, a design partner at Google Ventures and co-worker of Daniel Burka, inspired the concept for One Big Thing back in 2014. In a post in the Time advice blog, <a href=\"http://motto.time.com/4298916/plan-less-one-big-thing/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter\" target=\"_blank\">motto</a>, Zeratsky writes how he developed the idea when he came to realize the flaws with the to-do list.</p>\n<p>He drew out his concept on a sticky note every day, which featured one large box in the middle, where he listed his big task for the day, flanked by several smaller boxes for smaller tasks.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jazer/status/494510255326625792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">tweeting out a picture</a> of his sticky note one day in July, it spread quickly. One Big Thing improves upon this original system, he says.</p>\n<p>On the website built to promote the app, Nick Burka writes that there is no such thing as having multiple priorities, but that a person should have simply, one priority.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, with a little help, frustrated list-makers everywhere will be able to accomplish One Big Thing today.</p>\n<p>One Big Thing is currently <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1-big-thing/id999618902\" target=\"_blank\">free in the App Store</a> and is only available to iOS users.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/21/nick-burka-develops-app-that-helps-users-accomplish-one-important-goal-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a>.<br />\n</em>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/nick-burka-reimagining-idea-of-the-to-do-list-with-one-big-thing/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>#smallrooms podcast: Adam Epstein of Tab on being acquired</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/smallrooms-podcast-adam-epstein-of-tab-on-being-acquired/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/smallrooms-podcast-adam-epstein-of-tab-on-being-acquired/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 21:35:53 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Rob Kenedi]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64553</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Rob Kenedi once again has a coffee with Adam Epstein, founder of Tab, a restaurant payment and reservation system, recently acquired by Velocity.

While the government denied the report was ever meant to be released, the chair of the panel working on the report begged to differ.</p>\n<p>\u201cI understood it was going to be widely disseminated when I agreed to chair the panel,\u201d Margaret Dalziel, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo\u2019s Conrad Business, Entrepreneurship and Technology Centre, told the Post.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/ontarios-business-grants-read-the-full-report-on-where-the-billions-of-public-dollars-go\" target=\"_blank\">report itself</a> lists a total of 26 recommendations, which was summarized in five key areas. One of these include funding activities that generate spillover benefits to other companies, and by providing business support services that assist multiple companies simultaneously, as most of the support went to large and old companies. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Approximately 200 companies, or 0.1 percent of Ontario businesses, receive 30 percent of total Ontario business support, and this does not include the significant incentive packages provided to companies like Cisco and OpenText,&#8221; the report said, adding that business programs need to be reformed to provide more access to capital to younger companies. </p>\n<p>The recommendations also state that the Ontario government needs to support or create intermediary organizations that assist companies in adopting new business mindsets and methodologies, with the goal of delivering programs that provide companies with incentives, knowledge, and resources to compete globally. In January, the Canadian government announced a $50 million program to <a href=\"http://betakit.com/canadian-government-announces-50-million-program-to-help-smbs-with-global-export/\" target=\"_blank\">help small businesses with global expor</a>t. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, the report recommended the creation of a Business Support Programs Subcommittee of Treasury Board to be responsible for implementing the recommendations, as well as ongoing review and evaluation of Ontario\u2019s business support programs. More data needs to be collected on Ontario&#8217;s business support programs and its applicants to determine how best to approach business support programs in the future; for this reason, the report refrained from recommending which specific programs to cut. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Decisions about which programs to cancel and which to retain should wait until additional knowledge is obtained regarding which programs are effective and which are not,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;Programs delivered by intermediaries are particularly vulnerable because the government has the least access to information on recipient companies.&#8221;\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/report-says-most-of-ontario-business-support-goes-to-0-1-percent-of-provinces-businesses/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Spring University challenges the traditional &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; incubator model</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/spring-university-challenges-the-traditional-one-size-fits-all-incubator-model/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/spring-university-challenges-the-traditional-one-size-fits-all-incubator-model/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 19:08:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jonathon Narvey]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Launches]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[incubator]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64490</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The west coast is getting recognition for its increasing number of startups, incubators, and VC firms that make up its tech hub.

And now, one of the city\u2019s visionaries is giving back to the world. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://spring.is/\">Spring</a> startup school, based in Vancouver, finalized its <a href=\"http://spring.is/accelerating-global-impact-acquisition-kick-incubator/\" target=\"_blank\">acquisition of the Kick incubator</a> this April, and has rebranded its structured incubator program used in more than 30 cities as part of <a href=\"http://spring.is/spring-university/\" target=\"_blank\">Spring University</a>, which makes Spring&#8217;s resources available across the globe. The initial launch will include four primary courses to assist startups in varying degrees of development: Idea (Kick), Launch, Grow, and Funding.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The accelerator market has evolved, but the incubator market hasn\u2019t. This is what fills that gap.&#8221; &#8211; Keith Ippel, co-founder of Spring\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Can the startup model that has spread to an increasing number of hubs around North America be incubated in the same way everywhere? Not exactly. But there are definitely commonalities, suggests Spring co-founder Keith Ippel. He recently shared his vision with BetaKit of how SpringU will move forward, bringing its programs to a global network of incubators from here to Europe, South America, and Africa.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are universal truths,\u201d Ippel said. \u201cCustomer discovery, knowing the target audience, knowing someone will pay for your solution; those are universal across geography, whether you\u2019re a non-profit, co-op, brick and mortar, tech startup, and everything in between.\u201d</p>\n<p>The new program partners with local incubators that can provide the local context to round out budding entrepreneurs\u2019 training. \u201cIf we were to deliver the program exclusively online, all of the local nuances and characteristics of local development would be lost.\u201d Meanwhile, participating organizations can adapt the program according to local variables such as access to talent or capital, as well as the nature of technologies available.</p>\n<p>The decision to offer multiple programs instead of focusing on a single path came from Spring\u2019s hard-won experience. \u201cHistorically, incubators have had cookie cutter, one-size-fits-all programs that don\u2019t fit everyone,\u201d Ippel says. \u201cFor instance, other incubators might be talking about launch and funding, when the participants just want to know if their idea is any good. Meanwhile, some have already validated their idea and don\u2019t need to go through that process again. They need to focus on just launching well and being in the right place for it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\u201cAlternatively, when you\u2019ve launched, you may be running out of money and don&#8217;t have the tools to get to that B round, nor can you get the tools to get to revenue-positive. We ran Kick and have had 140 companies created, but post-launch a lot of entrepreneurs were left hanging unless they made it to an accelerator. Grow is really designed to fill that valley.\u201d</p>\n<p>A one-size-fits-all program was a good starting point, but the marketplace has evolved, he explains. \u201cFor instance, Y-Combinator made a lot of sense back then, but fast-forward to today, we have startup accelerators that are stage-specific, some that write a cheque, some that don\u2019t. The accelerator market has evolved, but the incubator market hasn\u2019t. This is what fills the gap.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/spring-university-challenges-the-traditional-one-size-fits-all-incubator-model/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>BCTIA announces Technology Impact Award finalists</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/bctia-announces-technology-impact-award-finalists/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/bctia-announces-technology-impact-award-finalists/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 17:56:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Event Recaps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[events]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64539</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Since 1994, the BCTIA has been celebrating the success of British Columbia companies with the Technology Impact Awards, which is dedicated to putting the...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Since 1994, the <a href=\"http://www.bctia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">BCTIA</a> has been celebrating the success of British Columbia companies with the Technology Impact Awards, which is dedicated to putting the spotlight on companies putting BC on the map.

On Thursday, April 21, #BotTO \u2014 organized by <a href=\"http://www.tinyhearts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tiny Hearts</a> \u2014 is hosting their second meetup at Toronto&#8217;s Shopify headquarters. The event will include speakers from Kik, which recently unveiled its <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/05/kik-opens-bot-shop-doors-with-16-chat-bots/\" target=\"_blank\">bot store</a>, and Shopify. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The bot and messaging space is still nascent and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what directions the developer and market forces will take it. We hope the attendees of #BotTO will be inspired to explore where these new platforms can be taken. More importantly, to connect and learn from each other\u2019s experiments,&#8221; said Robleh Jama, founder and CEO of Tiny Hearts. </p>\n<p>Tiny Hearts has been exploring the messaging space since 2014, when it developed the Next Keyboard. The Next keyboard was made possible thanks to a <a href=\"http://betakit.com/tiny-hearts-releases-next-keyboard-for-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter which managed to surpass the original $10,000 funding goal by $55,0000</a>, and a passionate community of 10,000 iOS developers. Since then, the team has learned the value of engaging communities when it comes to tech innovation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We knew from experience that a majority of our attention on mobile is going towards messaging apps. Bots are a more direct way to build products for messaging platforms. With the steady rise of Conversational Commerce over the last year, its clear that we are in a new shift in tech,&#8221; said Jama. &#8220;Every new technology platform needs to have a dedicated group of people interested and willing to share their experience with it. Instead of waiting for someone else to build a community around this topic, we just took it upon ourselves.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To join the #BotTO community and sign up for the event, check out <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Bot-TO/events/230021523/\" target=\"_blank\">the official meetup page</a>. </p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy Robleh Jama</em>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/botto-returns-to-predict-the-future-of-chat-bots-with-kik-and-shopify-keynotes/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Government and experts convene to talk driverless cars in Canada</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/planning-the-next-disruptive-technology-conference-looks-at-the-future-of-driverless-cars-in-canada/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/planning-the-next-disruptive-technology-conference-looks-at-the-future-of-driverless-cars-in-canada/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 13:00:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Vomiero]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[events]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64502</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[How do you convey the magnitude of something that sounds, to most people, like science fiction?

By referencing science fiction of course.</p>\n<p>The last time anyone saw a self-driving car was probably in the 2004 film iRobot. Will Smith\u2019s character Del Spooner, a gruff, anti-technology detective who doesn\u2019t trust anything with circuits, decides to drive manually at speeds that should only be attempted by a computer. His co-star Dr. Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan, scolds him for being so reckless. The film is set in the year 2035.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s striking about that scene is that even when making a movie about what almost becomes the robot apocalypse, the filmmakers couldn\u2019t fathom a driving scenario more advanced than one where human beings are still the primary vehicle operators. Keep in mind, the film was released over ten years ago. Today, what once seemed farfetched enough to be featured in a film that predicts how technology will take over the world, is about to become a reality in 2016.</p>\n<p>\u201cI look back at the 20th century on how vehicles changed the everyday lives of individuals. In this century, autonomous vehicles will have an impact of equal magnitude, on everything we do,\u201d argues Barrie Kirk at <a href=\"http://www.conferenceboard.ca/conf/16-0133/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Planning the Next Disruptive Technology</a> conference on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Kirk is the executive director of <a href=\"http://www.cavcoe.com/Team_Principals.htm\" target=\"_blank\">CAVCOE</a>, the Canadian Automated Vehicle Centre of Excellence. He\u2019s spoken at event after event on this subject, including a Future of Four Wheels Transportation panel at Ryerson University\u2019s Digital Media Zone in February. He\u2019s completely grey, and his accent reveals him as being from the U.K., where he received his designation as a Professional Engineer.</p>\n<p>Today, the self-driving car has many names including autonomous vehicle, automated vehicle technology, driverless car, and even just AV, as they\u2019ve become known to the regulars at these conferences.</p>\n<p>Kirk\u2019s basic argument echoes that of every other speaker on the panel today. Yeah, we could just open the door and let self-driving cars in, but why not use them to our advantage along the way? The question on everybody\u2019s lips is, how long should we wait to get started?</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s say that by 2030, the data is in and we know that computers are better drivers than silly, stupid humans. Is it really ethical to allow humans to cause all that carnage on the road?\u201d asks Kirk in response.</p>\n<p>He goes on to argue that when a full penetration of autonomous vehicles is achieved, societies may very well see an 80 percent drop in vehicle collisions. He adds that over half of citizen interaction with the police is traffic related, meaning that self-driving cars could free up law enforcement to deal with other issues more thoroughly.</p>\n<p>Self-driving cars pose a whole slew of benefits to the individual. In a lot of ways, self-driving cars mean a better world for you and for me. However, the changes won\u2019t stop there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/self-driving-car.jpg\" alt=\"self driving car\" width=\"889\" height=\"511\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64504\" /\n\nHis bottom line? There\u2019s no time like the present. Where it becomes controversial is that he suggests an Adam Smith-inspired strategy to make Canada a leader in this space is to let the private sector develop without government intervention; basically, keep the law out of it.\n\nAt this point, the energy in the room shifts and a panel discussion ensues. Government representatives from both the City of Toronto and the Province of Ontario straighten their ties and prepare to convince the now eager listeners to ignore that last point.\n\nThe brains of the operation at the City of Toronto is a man by the name of Stephen Buckley. A slight man who talks a mile a minute, he takes the podium and clears his throat.\n\n\u201cI think we have an opportunity here.\u201d He says. \u201cFrom a municipal standpoint, what really scared me was this.\u201d He throws a picture of Google\u2019s self-driving car up on the screen.\n\nHe goes on to say that they planned to build the product from top to bottom. From the hardware to the software, Google stood to control the technology and everyone else who wanted to use it. The price probably wouldn\u2019t be too outrageous because, in his words, \u201cThey have more money than God.\u201d\n\nAfter seeing in 2008 an image of an automated version of a Toyota Prius built by Google, Buckley went to work. Just this past February, he debuted the findings of his research team, based out of the University of Toronto, to a meeting of over 40 City of Toronto division heads.\n\nThe finding showed that one of three scenarios would likely come to pass. The first, is simply an extension of the private ownership model. Regular cars are simply replaced with autonomous vehicles and not much else changes.\n\nThe second scenario depicts a complete shift in the way Canadians think about mobility and vehicle ownership. He calls this model \u201cmobility as a service,\u201d which will see a conversion from private vehicle ownership to vehicle sharing companies like Uber and BlancRide. In this scenario, almost no one owns or feels the need to own their own car.\n\nIn addition, transportation as a service stands to add an extra <a href=\"http://www.cavcoe.com/articles/AV_rpt_2015-01.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">$65 billion</a> per year to the Canadian economy and save the average family $3,000 per year.</p>\n<p>The third scenario, which he stated was probably the most likely, is a mix of private ownership and mobility as a service.</p>\n<p>\u201cOvertime, this may transform mobility as we understand it. It may impact how we build, design and operate cities.\u201d</p>\n<p>He understands that new and disruptive technology will likely invoke a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d mentality among private companies. His argument is that the public sector needs to act soon, or other parties will act first. In an effort to do just that, the <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2015/10/15/ontario-first-in-canada-to-begin-testing-self-driving-vehicles-on-public-roads/\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Transportation</a> opened up Ontario streets for testing autonomous vehicles this past January.</p>\n<p>Buckley goes on to argue that self-driving cars will have a different impact depending on which location they\u2019re place in. \u201cThere will always be people who want to own their own vehicle, but urbanites might not be interested in owning as much,\u201d he said. Either way, he says, regulators need to inform themselves of this fast-approaching trend.</p>\n<p>Autonomous vehicles are coming, that part is clear.

The report proposes recommendations to address six specific barriers preventing businesses from growing, which include a lack of access to talent with scale up experience \u2014 an issue that Chris Arsenault from <a href=\"http://betakit.com/inovia-expands-its-waterloo-office-with-new-hire-to-take-a-chance-on-early-stage-entrepreneurs/\" target=\"_blank\">iNovia Capital recently raised</a> \u2014 gaps in the right kinds of financing, and lower incentives to growth.    </p>\n<p>\u201cThe release of Breaking Barriers coincides with initiatives currently underway by the governments of Canada and Ontario to help our most promising firms scale up,&#8221; said Allan O\u2019Dette, president and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. &#8220;We have an incredible opportunity to leverage this alignment across government and the business community to tackle this challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>To help scaling businesses, the report recommended re-aligning public programs and incentives to focus supports on high-growth firms, encouraging greater international trade activity by linking more business support programs to trade, improving access to public and private anchor customers by using procurement to strategically invest in growing businesses, and enabling accurate measurement and monitoring of the scale up challenge through collaboration between Statistics Canada and industry groups to collect and publicize relevant data.</p>\n<p>According to the survey, the cost of doing business was identified as a top issue by 69 percent of Ontario employers.</p>\n<div

Here&#8217;s the latest on who raised how much, and from whom. </p>\n<h3> Bridgit raises $2.2 million CAD to expand to the US</h3>\n<p>Since winning Google&#8217;s Demo Day <a href=\"http://betakit.com/bridgit-wins-google-demo-day-womens-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">back in December</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gobridgit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bridgit</a> has been building up its construction project management platform \u2014 including <a href=\"http://betakit.com/bridgit-brings-on-new-chief-technology-officer/\" target=\"_blank\">the hiring of a new CTO</a>. </p>\n<p>Today, the company announced that it raised $2.2 million CAD ($1.7 million USD) in a seed round led by Hyde Park Venture Partners with participation from Vanedge Capital. The funding will be used to hire new engineers and salespeople and acquire more customers in the United States.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe construction industry has been slow to adopt to new technology, but as we talk to residential and commercial builders, it\u2019s clear they are hungry for technology that lowers cost, simplifies processes and make it easier to get their jobs done,\u201d said Mallorie Brodie, CEO and co-founder of Bridgit. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Hyde Park and Vanedge so we can put Bridgit\u2019s solutions into the hands of more people who need them.\u201d</p>\n<p>To date, Bridgit has been used by more than 100 contractors and has consistently achieved double-digit month-over-month revenue growth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe that this type of innovation is sorely needed in the construction industry and that Bridgit has the ideal team to deliver it,\u201d said Greg Barnes, principal of Hyde Park Venture Partners. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see Mallorie, Lauren and their growing corps of experts build upon their solid foundation in the U.S. market.\u201d</p>\n<h3> PrecisionHawk raises $22 million CAD Series C</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.precisionhawk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PrecisionHawk</a>, which provides data collection and safety platforms for drones, raised $22 million CAD ($18 million USD) in Series C funding, according to a report from <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/20/precisionhawk-raises-18-million-to-bring-drones-safely-into-u-s-airspace/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a>.</p>\n<p>Existing investors Intel Capital, Millennium Technology Value Partners, and the Innovate Indiana Fund participated in the round. Verizon Ventures, insurance giants USAA, NTT Docomo Ventures, and Yamaha Motor Ventures also joined the round as new investors. The funding will be used to expand within the commercial agriculture business, as well as branch into different sectors including like oil and gas, mining and geology, and insurance.</p>\n<p>The company has an office in Toronto and was originally founded in Canada, with its headquarters now based in Raleigh, North Carolina. As drones gain more mainstream popularity, the company is hoping to stay ahead of eventual regulation by providing data and safety services services for commercial drones. The company is also known for developing the Lancaster, a data-collecting drone designed specifically for agriculture, energy and mining, and emergency response situations. </p>\n<p>\u201cBuilding and selling planes will arguably be the smallest part of our business,&#8221; PrecisionHawk CEO Bob Young told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our biggest opportunity and the faster growing part of our business is the platform we built for aerial data services.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some of the platforms that PrecisionHawk offers include <a href=\"https://www.datamapper.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DataMapper</a>, which allows drone users to upload data they&#8217;ve gathered to be stored and analyzed on the DataMapper platform, and LATAS, which allows drone operators basically get clearance to fly, track, and verify their own flight operations.  </p>\n<h3> Fiddlehead Technology raises $1.8 million in seed funding</h3>\n<p>Moncton-based <a href=\"http://fiddlehead.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Fiddlehead Technology</a>, a company dedicated to predictive forecasting for the food and beverage industry, announced $1.8 million in seed funding. The round was led by Build Ventures and the New Brunswick Innovation Foundation. </p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s flagship product, Forecast Guardian, mines data points per product to provide recommendations on improving forecast performance while also predicting the financial impact on the business. Its technology was developed in partnership with McCain Foods. </p>\n<p>\u201cForecasting has often been more art than science. But with our prescriptive analytics we can go beyond simply measuring forecast accuracy to offer data-driven recommendations to improve performance,\u201d said David Baxter, president and co-founder of Fiddlehead. \u201cThat leads directly to more accurate demand forecasts, allowing companies to lower inventory, improve service levels and boost margins.\u201c</p>\n<p>The company will use the funding to add data science and development staff, as well as increase its sales and marketing efforts throughout North America.</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/today-in-funding-bridgit-fiddlehead-technology-precisionhawk/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>CanCon Podcast Ep. 13: Should the Canadian government pick winners?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/cancon-podcast-ep-13-should-the-canadian-government-pick-winners/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/cancon-podcast-ep-13-should-the-canadian-government-pick-winners/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 18:57:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Douglas Soltys]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64461</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[When Apple stood up to the FBI a few weeks ago, we discussed the global implications of the tech leader&#8217;s fight for the security...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>When <a href=\"http://betakit.com/cancon-podcast-ep-5-startup-frat-bro-culture-and-the-pressure-to-scale/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple stood up to the FBI</a> a few weeks ago, we discussed the global implications of the tech leader&#8217;s fight for the security of its platform and the privacy of its users. Startling reporting in the past week, indicating BlackBerry&#8217;s cooperation in an RCMP criminal investigation, as well as the potential use of &#8216;Stingray&#8217; devices by Canada&#8217;s federal police force, has brought the debate far closer to home. Again, if forces us to ask: can Canadians have any expectation of digital privacy, and if so, who will enforce it?</p>\n<p>While Canadian tech companies are working with the federal government to pick conversations out of the air, the Ontario government is working on picking Canadian tech winners.

The value of BitGold is that gold is considered the most stable currency, so people that invest money in gold can protect their earnings. For example, a Canadian travelling to the US that wanted to convert their gold to US dollars wouldn&#8217;t be affected by the exchange rate, and could get more for their money. BitGold, which launched in May 2015, recently surpassed 850,000 users.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is another significant achievement for the Company and our shareholders. Graduation to the TSX less than one year after our initial listing on the TSX Venture Exchange reflects our rapid growth and maturation,&#8221; said Roy Sebag, president and CEO of GoldMoney. &#8220;It is a recognition of the strength and quality of our BitGold and GoldMoney products, as well as our commitment to a strong balance sheet, superior oversight and transparency, and a long-term approach to maximizing shareholder value by investing in our mission.\u201d</p>\n<p>As it moves into the TSX, the company also appointed Leslie D. Biddle to the board of directors. Biddle is currently a partner and president at New York-based value investment firm Serengeti Asset Management, and has spent 10 years in Goldman Sachs, where she acted as managing Director in 2004 and partner in 2006.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/less-than-a-year-after-launch-goldmoney-gets-listed-on-the-toronto-stock-exchange/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>BMO and DMZ partner to launch four-month Next Big Idea in FinTech program</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/bmo-and-dmz-partner-to-launch-four-month-next-big-idea-in-fintech-program/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/bmo-and-dmz-partner-to-launch-four-month-next-big-idea-in-fintech-program/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 10:00:30 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Launches]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64435</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[BMO and the DMZ have announced a partnership to identify \u2014 and support \u2014 the next big Canadian FinTech startup.

But after raising $800,000 in seed funding and partnering with one of Canada&#8217;s leading retail tech startups, the company has decided to take the wraps off and demonstrate how they&#8217;ve managed to attract hundreds of retailers to their platform after launching just a few months ago. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We were actually visible back in 2014 when we launched with an iBeacon-powered solution. We did a pivot during 2014 to better address the market needs and the reality of our retail customers, went stealth for about 18 months, built partnerships, signed up customers, raised our round, and this is really our first announcement since then,&#8221; said CTO and co-founder Antoine Azar. </p>\n<p>Thirdshelf&#8217;s investors include Otimo Ventures, iNovia Capital, Interaction Ventures, Karim Salabi, former EVP of Rona and co-founder of Ascends Commerce, and Marc Petit and Dominic Becotte, partners at XPND Capital. The company plans to use the funding to add thousands of retailers on its platform, continue developing its machine learning technology, and pursue further partnerships with retailers, according to <a href=\"https://www.thirdshelf.com/thirdshelf-raises-800k-retail-tech-pioneers\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bots can be an incredible marketing tool, and we&#8217;re just scratching the surface.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thirdshelf&#8217;s white-label platform targets independent retailers, allowing them to create branded loyalty programs that include spend and action-based rewards, percent or cash back, and punch cards. At the same time, retailers can use the PoS and ecommerce data gleaned from customers to figure out how to act on these insights.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are the only &#8216;dedicated; loyalty marketing solution for independent retailers, all the other options are &#8216;coalition programs&#8217;, like Belly and FiveStars,&#8221; said Rami Karam, CEO of Thirdshelf. &#8220;With Thirdshelf, the retailer retains a direct relationship with their customers. The shopper is signing up to the retailer&#8217;s branded loyalty program. The retailer is never presented alongside their competitors, and the retailer retains ownership of their customer list and data, whereas with a coalition program you are giving up ownership rights to the &#8220;coalition&#8221; and often the &#8220;coalition&#8221; is allowed to send 3rd party offers to your customers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The platform is currently tightly integrated with ecommerce solutions like <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedhq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lightspeed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vendhq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vend</a>, and <a href=\"http://springboardretail.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Springboard Retail</a>. &#8220;In order to make the customer experience at checkout completely seamless for the shopper and in order to make the checkout process as simple as possible for staff, this means Thirdshelf is easy to deploy and keeps the checkout process quick,&#8221; said Karam. &#8220;Because Thirdshelf is integrated to POS we are able to track the actual conversion to sales for the loyalty program and marketing offers and we can also calculate the related profitability. The result is that we make it easy for our retailers to understand if Thirdshelf is &#8220;working&#8221;, and which offers and incentives so they can do more of the good stuff.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One more way that Thirdshelf should prove ahead of the curve is by leveraging marketing bots, which are currently being considered &#8220;the next app&#8221;; companies are already looking to perfect their bot technology, as Shopify <a href=\"http://betakit.com/shopify-acquires-san-francisco-based-virtual-marketing-assistant-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">recently acquired San Francisco-based virtual marketing assistant Kit</a> and Payso decided to shut down its P2P offering <a href=\"http://betakit.com/payso-winding-down-p2p-product-to-focus-on-business-product/\" target=\"_blank\">to focus white labelling its app for banks and credit unions and using bots and AI for its conversational interface</a>. </p>\n<p>Thirdshelf&#8217;s marketing bot analyzes in-store and only activity in order to determine when to engage customers at the right time, and with personalized messaging. However, Azar makes the distinction that they are not building a &#8220;chat bot&#8221; \u2014 which he says are still &#8216;automated interactions&#8217; with no knowledge of the user&#8217;s preferences \u2014 and are focused on building a &#8220;relational bot&#8221;. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Bots can be an incredible marketing tool, and we&#8217;re just scratching the surface,&#8221; Azar said. &#8220;Instead of automating interactions, we&#8217;re automating relations. Our bot learns from every customer transaction and interaction.

Founders like Thalmic\u2019s Stephen Lake have spoken <a href=\"http://betakit.com/thalmics-stephen-lake-challenges-federal-government-to-better-define-canadas-innovation-agenda/\" target=\"_blank\">about the need to \u201cplace bets\u201d</a> on areas that have the most chance of success, and the new federal government has stepped in, showing some commitment to <a href=\"http://betakit.com/innovation-minister-navdeep-bains-reveals-commitment-to-cleantech-and-holistic-approach-post-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">making Canada a cleantech hub</a>. What many of these conversations have in common is the need to support those taking risks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://inovia.vc/\" target=\"_blank\">iNovia Capital</a> is one of those entities looking to support early stage entrepreneurs. The Montreal-based firm recently <a href=\"http://betakit.com/inovia-capital-raises-175-million-for-new-venture-capital-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">raised a $175 million fund</a>, overshooting its initial target of $150 million, and, as part of its strategy to support \u201cemerging category-defining platforms,\u201d has expanded its Waterloo office with the hire of Sarah Marion, formerly a senior researcher at the <a href=\"https://www.wlu.ca/media/news-releases/april-2015/mike-lazaridis-and-ontario-government-contribute-35m-to-create-world-class-management-institute-at-laurier.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lazaridis Institute for the Management of Technology Enterprises</a>. </p>\n<p>iNovia already has a presence in Waterloo, and is an investor in startups like <a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vidyard </a>and <a href=\"http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Clearpath Robotics</a>. However, Chris Arsenault, managing partner at iNovia, said that Marion is joining at just the right time. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow we have a critical mass of opportunities and building relationships with players from universities and large companies in the Waterloo tech community,\u201d said Arsenault. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to put feet on the ground to have a constant presence and be part of the flow, not just aware of the flow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marion is joining the team as an analyst. &#8220;I look for strong visionaries who are thought-leaders in their industry, with first-hand experience that allows them a distinctive insight into the problems they are solving,&#8221; Marion said. &#8220;I also look for companies that have a culture of working relentlessly to delight their customers, both creating and capturing value.&#8221; </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You\u2019re backing entrepreneurs who not only have a vision, but you have to feel that they can execute on that vision.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>While working as a founding team member of the Lazaridis Institute, Marion interviewed 125 Canadian technology thought leaders \u2014 including Arsenault \u2014 to analyze key barriers to growth facing Canadian startups. During her research, Marion discovered that one of the biggest barriers facing companies scaling in Canada was a lack of executive talent.</p>\n<p>\u201cCanada lacks senior managers who have experience leading a technology company through a phase of rapid, significant growth \u2014 which is critical to scaling from a startup to a billion-dollar company. This is largely due to the lack of existing and exited growth firms in our country\u2019s technology sector,\u201d said Marion. \u201cHowever, it is widely recognized that Waterloo is producing a phenomenal cadre of executive talent stemming from the region\u2019s emerging growth firms, and the Toronto-Waterloo ecosystem is growing the experienced senior managers that Canada needs to build billion-dollar companies.\u201d </p>\n<p>To combat the senior talent gap, Arsenault stressed how &#8220;critical&#8221; it is that over the next decade, communities in Waterloo Region and elsewhere support entrepreneurs as they transition from founders working out of a basement to building the next billion dollar company. At the same time, it will be critical for tech communities across Canada to address how they are building up their executives and attracting others from outside \u2014 Arsenault gave the example of BlackBerry, which set the stage for creating opportunities as it attracted outside top-tier talent. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wis-hero-tannery-1024x614.jpg\" alt=\"Waterloo Innovation Summit\" width=\"690\" height=\"414\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-52589\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;In building this base of thousands of early-stage tech companies across Canada, now is the time to scale them. When you talk about scale, Canada lacks overall talent that has been there, done that,&#8221; said Arsenault. &#8220;When you think about big infrastructure and software plays that grow from 0 to $5 million in revenue to $30 million, you have certain challenges. But when you have to convert that into $300 million, you can count on your two hands companies that have done that in the past few years. How are we building our own next generation of executives, and how will we be able to attract executives from the outside to join our own culture and move into our startups?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Part of the \u201cart\u201d of the venture business is understanding that early stage entrepreneurs only really control 50 percent of what happens to their business \u2014 such as attracting talent and building a product roadmap \u2014 while the people that back them support them for the things they can\u2019t control, like the time it takes to acquire customers and go through a full sales cycle.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not mature enough in terms of revenue or DNA, and half of them aren\u2019t even making any revenue, so everything is against them to succeed. You\u2019re backing entrepreneurs who not only have a vision, but you have to feel that they can execute on that vision,\u201d said Arsenault. \u201cYou have to not only understand their challenges, you have to accept the risk of failure for that company, and see how through our own network and relationships whether we can reduce that risk.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Overall we&#8217;re upping Canada&#8217;s game; we have to up our performance across the board \u2014 be it from a venture perspective from an entrepreneur perspective.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many founders say that it\u2019s easier today than five years ago to raise funding; as companies like <a href=\"http://www.allocadia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Allocadia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedhq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lightspeed</a> make headlines and the larger community buys the startup hype, venture capitalists today from smaller firms are feeling better about investing in the Canadian entrepreneurs that, despite lacking experience, make up for it in enthusiasm. iNovia already seems to be applying that viewpoint in its latest hire \u2014 Arsenault jokes that Marion, at only 23, made the team feel like she&#8217;d been working with them for five years already. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall we&#8217;re upping Canada&#8217;s game; we have to up our performance across the board, be it from a venture perspective from an entrepreneur perspective. There aren&#8217;t any frontiers, therefore you should have offices wherever your talent is, but at the same time we have to focus on where the pools of talent are across Canada, and Waterloo is one of them,&#8221; said Arsenault. </p>\n<p>\u201cSarah has the drive and DNA of what we consider to be a part of the iNovia DNA. The whole iNovia team has been founded and is managed by entrepreneurs and operators. Sarah being younger has all of these same attributes \u2014 maybe she doesn\u2019t have the number of years of experience in terms of operation, but she has the same drive.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/inovia-expands-its-waterloo-office-with-new-hire-to-take-a-chance-on-early-stage-entrepreneurs/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Peer-to-peer car rental marketplace Turo enters Canadian market in first international expansion</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/peer-to-peer-car-rental-marketplace-turo-enters-canadian-market-in-first-international-expansion/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/peer-to-peer-car-rental-marketplace-turo-enters-canadian-market-in-first-international-expansion/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 13:00:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Launches]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[p2p]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64336</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[When Turo, a car rental marketplace that allows drivers to rent their unused cars to renters, launched as RelayRides five years ago, CEO Andre...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>When <a href=\"https://turo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Turo</a>, a car rental marketplace that allows drivers to rent their unused cars to renters, launched as RelayRides five years ago, CEO Andre Haddad had difficulty selling people on the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s almost better to launch now than it was five years ago. When I was trying to sell people on this platform, they said, &#8216;Are you crazy? You\u2019re going to trust a stranger with the keys to your car?&#8217;\u201d Haddad joked. \u201cI think five years later with the growth of the sharing economy and all the attention that&#8217;s been focused on models that are similar to ours, I think we&#8217;re in a much more mature state of mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>That persistence is proving to pay off, as San Francisco-based Turo is officially launching across Canada. The service is now available in Ontario, Alberta, and Quebec, with a national launch planned in the coming months \u2014 making it Turo\u2019s first international launch. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve been working on our expansion in Canada for a bit over a year. It\u2019s been a thoughtful and methodical process,\u201d said Haddad. \u201cThat Canadian community on Turo that travels to the US and uses us is the most significant one that we have across any country. So we were delighted with the adoption of Turo by Canadian travellers visiting the US. Frankly, they have been incredible evangelists of the company and they&#8217;ve been lobbying us to launch in Canada for many years now. We felt it was right to respond to the community that&#8217;s most passionate about Turo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Haddad said that the Canadian market is also a significant one, with 23 million potential vehicles available. Turo\u2019s platform allows car owners to rent to pre-approved travellers, with owners being allowed to set minimum and maximum rent times for whatever they see fit \u2014 typically, the company sees car owners earning at least a extra $500 a month by renting out using Turo, and the company provides $2 million in liability insurance to every owner signed on to the platform, as well as 24-hour roadside assistance for drivers. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s not for everyone, some people prefer to do things the traditional way and thats okay,\u201d said Haddad. \u201cBut at least now, it&#8217;s an alternative that doesn&#8217;t sound so crazy anymore.&#8221;\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/peer-to-peer-car-rental-marketplace-turo-enters-canadian-market-in-first-international-expansion/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Miovision accelerating vision for smart cities with Swift Labs partnership</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/miovision-accelerating-vision-for-smart-cities-with-swift-labs-partnership/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/miovision-accelerating-vision-for-smart-cities-with-swift-labs-partnership/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 12:00:53 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Partnerships]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iot]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kitchener-Waterloo]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64364</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Since Miovision was founded by Kurtis McBride, the company has always tried to stay ahead of the curve in an industry slow to change;...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Since <a href=\"https://miovision.com\" target=\"_blank\">Miovision</a> was founded by Kurtis McBride, the company has always tried to stay ahead of the curve in an industry slow to change; the company got its start after McBride had experience counting cars at the side of the road for developers and municipalities seeking data for traffic optimization or building development.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have four core values which we use whenever we\u2019re hiring or designing products or picking investors, all of those things get filtered and evaluated through those four core values.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe built hardware and software that allows you to use a camera at an intersection to collect video, and then the software turns that video into traffic data. We did that for years, and then that product got introduced into the broader need for cities to manage flow of traffic,\u201d said McBride. \u201cWe started out just providing data, and then the city or engineers would figure out what that data meant. Then, we recently started branching off into the broader smart city and are building products to provide low-cost interconnectivity to intersections, basic alerting around power, all the way up to real-time control of traffic flow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since then, McBride says that Miovision has been dedicated to finding innovative solutions to ensure that the company is always ahead of the curve; he said that as far back as five years ago, they were trying to use cell networks to connect hardware to the internet before IoT was a thing. \u201cWe\u2019re always pushing the envelope on what\u2019s possible, whether that\u2019s new products or upgrades, or whether it\u2019s new hardware devices or new web capabilities, we try to stay up to date. We don\u2019t innovate just for the sake of it, but where it can make the customer experience better.\u201d</p>\n<p>That dedication seems to be paying off. The company recently celebrated its 10th birthday back in November, and has <a href=\"http://betakit.com/smart-cities-one-step-closer-with-miovision-ecopia-and-brisk-synergies-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">announced partnerships</a> to ensure that its innovation strategy is always up to par. Its latest partnership includes one with <a href=\"http://www.swiftlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Swift Labs</a>, a company dedicated to helping its clients identify critical issues with products as quickly as possible in order to keep development resources focused. Swift Labs will be helping Miovision in the development of new products.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a group inside Miovision called innovation labs, and one of the things that it does is that it maintains projects we\u2019d like to work on if we had more time in the day,\u201d said McBride. \u201cWe met Anthony Middleton from Swift and his team there, and we got know their capabilities and saw a natural fit between their skill set and our list of things, and I find that as you grow, you find that you have more people there and you think that you should do more things but that isn\u2019t always the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>McBride gave Middleton the list of projects that the company had been meaning to work on and gave their team an \u201cimpossible timeline\u201d. Swift Labs was given seven weeks to create a fully functional prototype of a patented design in response to a Miovision RFP.</p>\n<p>\u201cPart of it is being able to attract enough people to work on problems, and part of it is that there was some technical challenges we had to overcome that required very specific skill sets,\u201d said McBride, citing the fact that many Swift Labs engineers have extensive BlackBerry engineering experience. \u201cBetween them they have close to 100 years experiences doing intricate radio frequency design for some of BlackBerry\u2019s phone products. They had a very specialized skill set that made it easier and possible for them to work on this project, where other teams including mine might have had some challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Miovision continues to grow past its 10th birthday, maintaining a consistent and strong culture within the company is something that McBride stays dedicated to by being able to communicate core values internally. \u201cWe have four core values which we use whenever we\u2019re hiring or designing products or picking investors, all of those things get filtered and evaluated through those four core values,\u201d said McBride. \u201cSticking to them sometimes takes longer, or means you spend more money, but ultimately we find if you stick to those guiding principles, as long as you pick them right the first time, that allows you to maintain the culture,\u201d he said.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/miovision-accelerating-vision-for-smart-cities-with-swift-labs-partnership/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>VanHackathon connects Canadian companies to a world of talent</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/vanhackathon-connects-canadian-companies-to-a-world-of-talent/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/vanhackathon-connects-canadian-companies-to-a-world-of-talent/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2016 21:35:44 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jonathon Narvey]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Event Recaps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vanhackathon]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64305</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The ever-increasing need for tech talent is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, challenge for Vancouver\u2019s growing technology hub (and Canada\u2019s tech...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>The ever-increasing need for tech talent is one of the biggest, if not <em>the</em> biggest, challenge for Vancouver\u2019s growing technology hub (and Canada\u2019s tech scene more generally). But the <a href=\"https://www.vanhack.com/hackathon/\">VanHackathon</a> aims to helps solve the problem in a new way by virtually bringing in hundreds of developers and designers from all over the world from May 20 to 22. They\u2019ll be working on projects submitted by Canadian companies \u2013 getting a very welcome introduction to the local tech ecosystem (Despite the &#8216;Van&#8217; in the name, the hackathon is actually open to Canadian firms from coast to coast).</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <a href=\"http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/canada-needs-182000-people-to-fill-these-it-positions-by-2019/287535\">Information and Communication Technology Council</a> says there will be lack of over 182,000 tech workers in Canada by 2019,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.vanhack.com/\">VanHack</a> CEO Ilya Brotzky, who started the company in 2014 after coming back from Brazil to Canada. He realized there was a huge opportunity to match Brazil\u2019s tech talent with Canada\u2019s fast-growing startup scene. Their hiring partners already include big names like Amazon, Zenefits, Shopify, and Hootsuite, demonstrating real demand for the idea. Their talent pool includes thousands of developers, designers, and digital marketers with in-demand skills such as Ruby on Rails, PHP, Java, Python, Java Script, iOS, Android, .NET,  and Photoshop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_8037-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"vanhackathon\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-64329\" /></a></p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re facing a lack of talent and people are frustrated because companies can\u2019t grow without the right people,\u201d Brotzky says. \u201cThe immigration system right now makes it tough for acquiring talent, since there\u2019s high barriers for them to jump over.\u201d He notes that if it takes six months or a year to bring in someone, it\u2019s just going to take too long to make a difference. The company will either not hire someone, or may settle for a local hire that might not even be the best fit. Matching up tech talent with employers should be easier than that: \u201cOne of our values is that code has no accent. If you can speak Ruby (on Rails, a programming language), you can speak Ruby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hiring that talent is really just the beginning of a bigger opportunity for the host country, Brotzky adds. \u201cImmigrants are job creators. What I see happening is that companies will be able to grow faster, bring in more revenue, hopefully salaries, exits, investors, and the ecosystem will continue to grow. We\u2019re not just bringing in talent, but bringing in entrepreneurs who will increase revenue and wages across the board.\u201d</p>\n<p>Canadian companies can <a href=\"https://vanhack.typeform.com/to/FjgNQ7\">submit their project</a> directly to the Vanhackathon and get involved today.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/vanhackathon-connects-canadian-companies-to-a-world-of-talent/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>#BKchats: How can startups keep great talent?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/bkchats-how-can-startups-keep-great-talent/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/bkchats-how-can-startups-keep-great-talent/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2016 20:39:53 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Douglas Soltys]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64309</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Right now, the Canadian tech ecosystem is bracing for a coming talent gap.

When he found the Freshii app way more efficient, he wondered why more local businesses didn\u2019t have similar solutions.</p>\n<p>He found out why after he and his business partner Kelsey Regan decided to look into the potential for this idea, and discovered that employing a firm to make such an app costs $9,800 per platform including HST \u2014 so to have an Android, BlackBerry, and iOS app would mean dishing out at least $32,000, with a $65 monthly maintenance fee per location.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason that independents couldn\u2019t really afford their own mobile payment or loyalty solution, so that\u2019s where the idea came from. It became apparent that it was just too expensive. So what we decided to do at that point was to start working on this project,\u201d said Shahjahan.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Canadians want to pay with their mobile phones, and ReUp offers small businesses a simple way to build a sleek mobile app with payment capabilities that directly caters to this growing demand.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Almost two years later, Shahjahan is now the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.getreup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ReUp</a>, a customizable mobile app platform starting at just $89 per month (Regan is now head of mobile product and CTO). ReUp\u2019s platform allows local, independent businesses to create their own branded mobile payment app for iOS and Android. Businesses that use ReUp can accept mobile payments from customers, accept physical and digital gift cards, and the company also allows retailers to use plug-in integrations from their own third party choices, including loyalty services, reservations, and order-ahead services.</p>\n<p>Recently, ReUp has given retailers the option to accept PayPal as a payment option from customers, and Shahjahan expects that the offering will make ReUp more valuable, as PayPal is currently the most popular mobile payment platform with 65 percent of Canadians reporting they have used it in the past six months, according to a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.gfk.com/en-ca/insights/press-release/canadians-preference-for-non-cash-payment-methods-continues-to-grow-gfk-study/\" target=\"_blank\">GFK study</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Canadians want to pay with their mobile phones, and ReUp offers small businesses a simple way to build a sleek mobile app with payment capabilities that directly caters to this growing demand,&#8221; said Alexander Peh, head of mobile and market development at PayPal Canada. &#8220;At PayPal, we\u2019re always looking to collaborate with cool startups like ReUp that offer Canadians an innovative way to pay with their mobile phones and better positions Canadian small businesses to compete.&#8221;</p>\n<p>ReUp started working with Paypal last year after finding that a lot of merchants had no way to accept PayPal in store. \u201cWe found that a lot of merchants want to offer PayPal as an option because customers have it, but retailers didn\u2019t have any way in-store to accept PayPal. PayPal technology in Canada isn\u2019t as available as a brick-and-mortar solution, minus you sitting at a computer to receive money in exchange for goods,\u201d said Shahjahan.  &#8220;For most fast-moving restaurants or businesses, they don\u2019t have a lot of time for that workflow.\u201d </p>\n<p>With this offering, businesses can accept PayPal as a payment type at their counter. \u201cThe customer can pop open their ReUp app and show they have credit and the merchant can then scan their device.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shahjahan said that the value of ReUp comes from the fact that a personalized app means that competitors aren\u2019t potentially sharing a platform through marketplaces like eBay; in his words, more businesses will need services like ReUp because history repeats itself, especially in technology. </p>\n<p>\u201cRemember eBay stores. Everyone had their own store, and that\u2019s where ecommerce became accessible for everyone, but you didn\u2019t have many options. You could either hire a big consulting firm for $20,000 to $30,000, or you can go to an eBay store which was a shared platform for everyone,\u201d said Shahjahan. \u201cSo what happened in between then and now, Shopify popped up to provide a white label solution for independent and small businesses that didn\u2019t look like it was part of any platform, and gave merchants the ability to express their brand and sell their products.&#8221;\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/reup-helps-independent-businesses-catch-up-in-the-age-of-mobile-apps/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>UK-based Transferwise moves into Canada to challenge high money transfer fees</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/uk-based-transferwise-moves-into-canada-to-challenge-high-money-transfer-fees/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/uk-based-transferwise-moves-into-canada-to-challenge-high-money-transfer-fees/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2016 17:27:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Launches]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Disruptors]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64299</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[As banks often take &#8220;a pound of flesh&#8221; for moving money across countries, The Disruptors co-host Amber Kanwar sat down with UK-based Transferwise, which...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>As banks often take &#8220;a pound of flesh&#8221; for moving money across countries, <em>The Disruptors</em> co-host Amber Kanwar sat down with UK-based <a href=\"https://transferwise.com/ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Transferwise</a>, which recently entered Canada and has attracted the attention of investors like Peter Thiel and Richard Branson, to find out how they&#8217;re trying to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>Transferwise &#8220;Moving money across countries shouldn&#8217;t really cost that much, it&#8217;s just moving bits and bytes electronically. It&#8217;s a bit more difficult than sending emails across countries, but not by a huge amount,&#8221; said Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann, executive co-founder of Transferwise. &#8220;But somehow, banks get to take about $200 billion every year in hidden charges for international transfers. We see this not only as a local or European problem, it&#8217;s very much a global problem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the past, Transferwise has been accused of &#8220;skirting regulations&#8221; in the US to offer their services. &#8220;We&#8217;re licensed in most countries and the rules that apply to us are the same that apply to banks \u2014 like banks, we have to do anti-money laundering procedures, and to be honest I think it&#8217;s much harder to do something inappropriate via our platform than through a traditional banking system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In Canada, we&#8217;re licensed by FinTrac, the local FinTech regulator.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch the whole interview below: </p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=850016&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a production partner on <a href=\"http://betakit.com/category/the-disruptors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Disruptors</a>.

BlancRide&#8217;s platform, which is targeted to people who consistently go between locations like work and home, currently has 12,000 users in Toronto, and, interestingly, is available in Venezuela. &#8220;With a tap, you can see who are the people that are travelling along your route, and pick the person who potentially shares some interest with you and you can share the ride together,&#8221; said Hamid Akbari, CEO and founder of BlancRide. Money is automatically split between the driver and passenger to remove that friction. </p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on the highway and you look at the car on your left, and the car on your right, and you&#8217;re all going in the same direction. This potentially solves that problem,&#8221; said co-host Amber Kanwar.</p>\n<p>Co-host Bruce Croxon, for his part, wondered how big the market is as people often organize themselves. &#8220;You see them in the place you park before you get on the lane, you&#8217;ve got lanes that people can take advantage of, so I guess this app kind of takes it to the next level where it can organize and bring people together using technology,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Watch the whole pitch below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=850011&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a production partner on <a href=\"http://betakit.com/category/the-disruptors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Disruptors</a>.

Trudeau said during the announcement. &#8220;That includes core work into theoretical physics, innovative training programs, and outreach programs designed to get students, teachers, and all Canadians excited about science.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Trudeau pointed out that without work being done at places like the Perimeter Institute, we wouldn&#8217;t have breakthroughs like computers or wireless technology. &#8220;We promised that our government would value science, and would invest in innovation to grow our economy, and I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re delivering on that promise,&#8221; Trudeau said. </p>\n<p>During the question period for reporters, Prime Minister Trudeau addressed <a href=\"http://betakit.com/thalmics-stephen-lake-says-poor-transit-major-issue-for-ontario-startups/\" target=\"_blank\">the need for reliable transportation</a> between the Toronto-Waterloo Region, saying that he&#8217;s been working with &#8220;innovators&#8221; on the issue. &#8220;The fact is that it&#8217;s not up to the federal government to tell Kitchener-Waterloo or Toronto what&#8217;s right for all of you. The federal government will be a partner to the Region and Canadians that have plans to grow economy and respond to challenges.

Murphy has worked as a litigation lawyer for small businesses and franchises, and holds two law degrees from McGill University and a master\u2019s from the London School of Economics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lawyers like this system because it provides them with automation tools that makes their job easier and they&#8217;re happy to provide savings to their clients for using this efficient platform, and clients like it because it&#8217;s online, simple, and helps small businesses define the needs they have at each phase of growth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Co-host Bruce Croxon could relate to the &#8220;efficient matchmaking&#8221; service side of the platform, as the founder of Lavalife. &#8220;When I see verticals like that, and the legal one is obvious, it&#8217;s huge.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Co-host Amber Kanwar joked that it was karma for the lawyers. &#8220;They had it coming for all those fees!&#8221; </p>\n<p>Watch the whole pitch below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://bmplayer-a.akamaihd.net/shareable/embedssl.html?dc=bnn_web&#038;cid=850013&#038;col=766&#038;w=640&#038;h=360&#038;pl=0&#038;plh=0&#038;adSite=ctv.bnn&#038;adZone=shows/thedisruptors&#038;omniAcct=ctvgmtvebnndesktop,ctvgmglobal&#038;section=shows&#038;site=shows&#038;shareUrl=&#038;v7=the_disruptors&#038;v8=&#038;v9=&#038;v10=\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a production partner on <a href=\"http://betakit.com/category/the-disruptors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Disruptors</a>.

(Full Disclosure: I moderated a panel called American History in Binary Code focused on \u2018the next generation of human enterprise\u2019).</p>\n<p>That, as the jury-is-out crowd are wont to say, is a very good question. Either way, folks on stage and members of the audience asking questions performed a heroic service in connecting the dots between the various focal points: education sessions about tech for enterprise-class companies, panels exploring new paradigms of business like the sharing economy, and more openly political discussions involving panels on security and democratization through social media.</p>\n<p>It was fun, it was different \u2014 and it provoked a lot of follow-up discussions afterwards over cold beverages and a relaxed after-party atmosphere sponsored by IBM. Here are some of the highlights.</p>\n<h3> Managing chaos and the future of business</h3>\n<p>Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP, kicked off the conference by keynoting a presentation on Year Zero \u2013 about how today\u2019s business world is advancing so quickly that there is very little to compare between what we do now and what we did even at the beginning of the Internet age (much less the pre-digital era). \u201cBetween the social world and the enterprise world, there\u2019s convergence,\u201d he said. \u201cBusinesses today need to combine the pieces that are important to the people, like social, while integrating analytics, to make products useful.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The cleverness you will have to have as a leader who can hold culture and values together for 20 years will be difficult.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe customer is going to come at you through any number of channels \u2014 and that (mobile) device is going to be the gateway to any of those relationships,&#8221; McDermott said. &#8220;From the customer\u2019s perspective, they\u2019ll say, if you don\u2019t have a perspective on other things that are social, you\u2019re a loser \u2014 I\u2019m going to find someone who shares interests with me (before making a purchase).\u201d </p>\n<p>Looking at the other side of business, how companies are managing their own people, McDermott was enthused about the new choices and capabilities technology was giving us. \u201cWe have 77,000 employees at SAP, but we also have 2 million in our ecosystem that supports SAP. You couldn\u2019t possibly hire two million, so you need that support ecosystem \u2014 and once that\u2019s working, why not grow to five million?\u201d</p>\n<p>McDermott said that it\u2019s an opportunity, but also a challenge for leaders trying to sustain their company culture. \u201cIf you look at the sustenance of corporate cultures, making sure your purpose is going to be held together in the next 20 years, it\u2019s going to get harder \u2014 because people still need human contact,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe things that matter tend to happen when we\u2019re together. The cleverness you will have to have as a leader who can hold culture and values together for 20 years will be difficult, because with speed, comes mixed messages. How do you hold it all together, so people are focusing on the things that are most important? Your job as the leader is to keep enough edginess in the system \u2014 but what I see is chaos and confusion and overconsumption of the things that matter. People have difficulty distinguishing between the one or two things that matter and the 22 things that don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Disrupting industries and making our own rules</h3>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Does privacy impede progress? It does, if we\u2019re talking about optimizing efficiency and bells and whistles.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p> &#8211; Erin Kenneally, head of cyber security at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The next session addressed how technology and new questions around ethics are transforming centuries-old industries. \u201cTechnology is helping government to get comfortable with regulating a product, marijuana, that was outside the bounds \u2014 and now the questions are about tracking where it\u2019s distributed, how much it costs,\u201d said Jessica Billingsley, CEO of MJ Freeway. \u201cThe green rush community \u2013 we\u2019re talking about other scheduled substances. Do we draw the line where it has medical benefit? Or do we allow humans to make their own informed choices?\u201d With access to more data, governments, and the citizens who elect them. can make better decisions about how to deal with entirely new and sometimes controversial kinds of businesses.</p>\n<p>While technology is making those new business models possible, the savvy entrepreneur recognizes the need to connect with customers beyond the digital world, noted Lisa Skakun, chief legal officer at Mogo, which is presently disrupting the old banking industry by offering financial tools and loans online. \u201cHow do you respond to the importance of human interaction? As an example, we\u2019ve got a program, Adulting 101, which is effectively gamified financial literacy over wine tasting. It\u2019s about making it relevant to people, with a digital interaction but starting with a human touch point.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Privacy vs. security: sometimes, it\u2019s right to be paranoid</h3>\n<p>In another somewhat obscurely-named panel (Axioms of Silicon Valley Stuck on Repeat) the true focus of the panel was on privacy versus the \u201cbig business of big data\u201d. Erin Kenneally, head of cyber security at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, nailed the pertinent conundrum: \u201cDoes privacy impede progress? It does, if we\u2019re talking about optimizing efficiency and bells and whistles. There\u2019s no doubt this has exposed fractures between our conception of privacy and privacy laws.\u201d </p>\n<p>Complicating things further, private citizens, corporations, or government may not even know a violation of privacy has occurred until long after it happens \u2013 putting both law enforcement and the legislative process itself in a never-ending game of catch-up.</p>\n<p>Getting agreement on stage for her proposition, she was also optimistic about whether this was really a circle that could be squared. \u201cOf course we can solve this,\u201d Kenneally said. \u201cTechnology is not a self-executing, autonomous thing. It is designed and built by human beings. To the extent we want to protect our privacy, we absolutely can. But invariably, keeping mind I\u2019ve worked with a number of information sharing projects with government, the problem is about getting people to work together in ways that they agree.\u201d</p>\n<p>Technological change is spurring political reactions in some very dramatic and surprising ways \u2013 and there\u2019s no doubt that the conversations at Interzone will be the catalyst for much deeper discussions in the weeks and months to come.\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/interzone-examines-convergence-between-politics-and-privacy-in-a-digital-age/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>PwC Canada names winners of 2016 Vision to Reality Awards</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/pwc-canada-names-winners-of-2016-vision-to-reality-awards/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/pwc-canada-names-winners-of-2016-vision-to-reality-awards/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 15:47:50 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64228</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[After announcing the shortlist of its Vision to Reality Awards celebrating innovation across the business landscape \u2014 which included startups like Wealthsimple, Sensibill, and...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>After announcing the <a href=\"http://betakit.com/pwc-announces-finalists-for-its-2016-vision-to-reality-awards/\" target=\"_blank\">shortlist of its Vision to Reality Awards</a> celebrating innovation across the business landscape \u2014 which included startups like <a href=\"https://www.wealthsimple.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wealthsimple</a>, <a href=\"https://getsensibill.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sensibill</a>, and <a href=\"http://rubikloud.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rubikloud</a> \u2014 the final winners were chosen after a gala at the Arcadian Loft in Toronto. </p>\n<p>The awards named three companies as innovators of the year in three categories meant to recognize startups (the disruptor), mid-market businesses (the builder), and large enterprises (the visionary). </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.farmersedge.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Farmers Edge</a>, an agtech company that uses various technologies to determine the unique characteristics of a singular plot of land in order to manage it individually, took the award for The Disruptor. <a href=\"http://www.hydrogenics.com/about-the-company/news-updates/2016/04/15/hydrogenics-recognized-at-pwc-canada-s-2016-vision-to-reality-innovator-of-the-year-awards\" target=\"_blank\">Hydrogenics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.celestica.com/home\" target=\"_blank\">Celestica</a> took home the builder and the visionary awards respectively. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Congratulations to all winners and finalists for their unwavering commitment to innovation and creativity and their relentless pursuit to transform their vision to reality,&#8221; said Tahir Ayub, managing partner of markets and industries at PwC Canada. &#8220;This year&#8217;s award applicants personify the potential Canada has to become a global innovation leader.

Geared for companies of any size (but particularly hitting the streams that startup founders love), the event has grown from one day (last year) to two and the list of premier speakers is growing, including crowd pleasers from Y Combinator, Hotwire, Hootsuite, and more. After the successful sold-out event in 2015, the organizers went on to bring Traction down to San Francisco as well \u2013 and they\u2019ve learned from these past success stories how they want to change things up in 2016.</p>\n<p>We spoke to Traction co-founder Ray Walia (also CEO of Launch Academy and Victory Square Ventures) about what to expect from Traction in 2016.</p>\n<h5>What\u2019s different this time out?</h5>\n<p>\u201cAs they say, if it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it \u2014 so a lot is similar to last year,\u201d Walia said. \u201cThat said, we\u2019ve extended it to two days. There will be longer, in-depth talks the first day, while the second day is more about rapid-fire keynotes. But the overall theme of the conference is still about how to get traction of customer retention, monetization, et cetera,\u201d While they\u2019re spreading the learning out over more time, the conference will top out at 600 attendees, to \u201ckeep it intimate.\u201d</p>\n<p>He notes that because they approached large, unicorn companies to ask which speakers they would want to send and put an emphasis on \u2018traction\u2019, they\u2019re seeing more CMOs instead of CEOs on stage this time. Where the previous focus was on how to create a strategy and a business model, these talks will \u201cgo a bit deeper. Now, it\u2019s more about the execution.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since today\u2019s audience is finding it harder to raise money than a year ago, they\u2019re looking for more actionable ways to get competitive, Walia explains. \u201cThe people on stage are also still raising larger rounds, but they\u2019re understanding that times are tougher for them as well. To maintain that valuation, it falls back to customer monetization and acquisition \u2013 and that\u2019s what they can talk about.\u201d</p>\n<p>In some ways, it\u2019s about getting back to fundamentals, talking about building companies, not just startups. \u201cWe went through a big phase on building a business versus building a fundraising machine, as <a href=\"http://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/build-a-business-not-a-financial-machine/\">Gary Vanderchuk</a> has talked about. We need to remember that the most valuable investor your company can have is a paying customer. That\u2019s why we like to hear talks from speakers around the customer journey, customer success stories and how to leverage existing customer bases.\u201d</p>\n<h5> Disruption is a big buzzword at just about any tech event these days. What other ideas might get thrown into the mix?</h5>\n<p>\u201cNot a buzzword, but just looking at who the speakers are and what\u2019s been happening with their companies, you\u2019ll see more about what\u2019s been happening on an international stage, in Europe and Asia, not just North America,\u201d Walia says.</p>\n<p>While he agrees that Vancouver-based companies will often not start out with a big vision beyond taking on the local market, a bigger ambition is critical for success. \u201cIn order to build a viable business, you need to think globally. It\u2019s not just about what you\u2019re doing \u2013 it\u2019s about asking what your competitors are also doing in Asia and Europe.\u201d</p>\n<h5>There are a lot of events out there eating up our bandwidth. How is Traction different?</h5>\n<p>\u201cFor those who aren\u2019t familiar with Traction, it\u2019s another conference. But this is an opportunity to advance your business. The ideas and opportunity to learn is hard to replicate. The talks are focused on actionable results and actual use cases. You find that the educational aspect of the typical conference is underrated \u2013 where people say there\u2019s a lot of networking, but the stuff on stage is secondary. We want to make sure what\u2019s on stage is primary.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Enter to win a ticket to Traction in Vancouver \u2013 an exclusive BetaKit opportunity!</h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to enter the draw:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enter your information via this <a href=\"http://re.tc/oq67s99u\" target=\"_blank\">Google form</a>.

The platform allows retailers to integrate with social media channels like Twitter, Facebook, and Google \u2014\u00a0as well as media parties like MSN, Microsoft, and the Chicago Tribune \u2014 for greater distribution scale than print.  The company said that its platform reaches 50 million consumers, and represents 140,000 store fronts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Flipp is helping retailers transform their marketing strategy. It&#8217;s exciting to see how our technology is enabling retailers to achieve incremental store trips, increased consumer engagement, and a higher ROI with reduced costs,&#8221; said Wehuns Tan, CEO and co-founder of Flipp. &#8220;General Atlantic&#8217;s expertise in global expansion and significant capital base will enable us to grow our footprint, extend our partnerships, and further accelerate how we deliver innovation into the hands of consumers around the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Flipp boasts customers like Walmart, Macy&#8217;s, Dollar General, and Lowe&#8217;s, and it has over 250 employees worldwide. </p>\n<p>&#8220;As newspaper consumption continues to erode, we believe Flipp is uniquely positioned to disrupt one of the last remaining vestiges of the print advertising world, the weekly sales circular, by providing innovative digital content management technology to retailers,&#8221; said Zachary Kaplan, VP of General Atlantic&#8217;s Internet and Technology sector. He continued, &#8220;There is a significant opportunity in this market for Flipp to deepen its partnerships, broaden its consumer base, and expand its offerings globally. We look forward to working with Wehuns and his team as they continue to accelerate growth.&#8221;</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/flipp-receives-61-million-strategic-growth-investment-from-general-atlantic/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>TD releases financial management app to its 3.5 million active mobile users</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/td-releases-financial-management-app-to-its-3-5-million-mobile-active-users/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/td-releases-financial-management-app-to-its-3-5-million-mobile-active-users/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2016 18:48:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Rose Behar]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Launches]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64181</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Yesterday afternoon, TD Canada Trust began rolling out its brand new personal finance app MySpend to its approximately 3.5 million active mobile users.

The app is a companion to TD\u2019s existing banking app and will help customers track their monthly spending in real-time. It is the result of a year\u2019s work with partner Moven, a U.S. startup that built the technology behind the app.</p>\n<p>Rizwan Khalfan, Chief Digital Officer at TD Canada Trust, told MobileSyrup that the app is first of its kind amongst the big banks in Canada. He noted that even the big banks in the U.S. aren\u2019t currently offering an app with the same capabilities.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe started with the idea that most Canadians have a difficult time tracking their spending,\u201d Khalfan said, \u201cThe traditional way of doing that is creating a budget, then reconciling your transactions to that budget.\u201d</p>\n<p>He added that typically this means people are looking back at the month, rather than looking at the month in real-time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis mobile-first approach is unique,\u201d said Khalfan, \u201cBecause it gives you real-time notification.\u201d</p>\n<p>In fact, the personal finance manager is not just mobile-first, it\u2019s mobile-only. There is no online component of the tool because Khalfan believes the mobile aspect of this technology will be at the core of its efficacy.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the web, it\u2019s not instant. It\u2019s only when you\u2019re online. With mobile, the engagement with the customer is at a very different level because it\u2019s immediate.\u201d</p>\n<p>The app is now available to all Android users, and the bank states that the iOS version will be available soon. It can be launched through the side menu of a user\u2019s current TD app, and will auto-populate with all the user\u2019s accounts.</p>\n<p>The main screen of the app is a wheel that shows how much a user has spent in the current month compared to their typical average spending, which is calculated according to up to 12 months of past spending history with the bank.</p>\n<p>Each transaction made in an account automatically sends a push notification and digital receipt to the user, then is automatically filed in to a category, which can be reorganized if incorrect.</p>\n<p>Khalfan said that he believes the rest of the big North American banks will soon join TD in offering this kind of personal finance app.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re all working on it,\u201d he said, \u201cSooner or later, they\u2019ll catch up.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/14/td-new-financial-management-app-myspend/\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/td-releases-financial-management-app-to-its-3-5-million-mobile-active-users/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Today in video: Rumble ranks 47 on comScore top 100, BroadbandTV third largest video property in the world</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/today-in-video-rumble-ranks-47-on-comscore-top-100-broadbandtv-third-largest-video-property-in-the-world/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/today-in-video-rumble-ranks-47-on-comscore-top-100-broadbandtv-third-largest-video-property-in-the-world/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2016 17:19:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64153</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[comScore, a cross-platform measurement company that precisely measures audiences, brands, and consumer behaviour across digital, TV, and movie media, released a report for February...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>comScore, a cross-platform measurement company that precisely measures audiences, brands, and consumer behaviour across digital, TV, and movie media, released a report for February 2016 evaluating the top 100 worldwide media properties \u2014 and Canada-based companies managed to score high in unique views. </p>\n<h3> BroadbandTV named third largest global video property after Google and Facebook </h3>\n<p>Vancouver-based <a href=\"http://bbtv.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BroadbandTV</a>, the world&#8217;s largest multi-platform network, is the third largest video property in the world.

BBTV beat out VEVO, which had 306,878,000 unique views.</p>\n<p>BBTV distributes short-form content across its several media brands, including its gaming network TGN, and hip hop music network Opposition. The company also acquired of digital kids content producer, YoBoHo HooplaKidz, to launch its HooplaKidz network, and announced a partnership with The Huffington Post to establish Outspeak, a citizen journalism brand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re one of the largest creators and distributors of short form content globally, and the business continues to develop at an incredible rate, we\u2019re now poised for another period of significant growth,\u201d said Shahrzad Rafati, founder and CEO BroadbandTV. \u201cIn 2016, we expect to accelerate further as we continue to scale the business both domestically and internationally, expand our verticals, create and distribute compelling content across more platforms, and further diversify revenue streams.\u201d</p>\n<h3> Rumble ranks 47 on comScore\u2019s Top 100 content video ranking </h3>\n<p>Toronto-based <a href=\"https://rumble.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rumble</a>, a video licensing platform which <a href=\"http://betakit.com/toronto-based-rumble-announces-partnership-with-getty-images/\" target=\"_blank\">recently announced a partnership with Getty Images</a>, ranked 47 on comScore\u2019s top 100 content video ranking for February 2016. The platform reached more than 8 million unique views on mobile and desktop.</p>\n<p>\u201cRumble\u2019s growth has been exponential over the past year, so we\u2019re excited to see that recognized in comScore\u2019s rankings,\u201d said Chris Pavlovski, CEO, Rumble. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on building an incredible network using the power of video creators, and it\u2019s clear that the variety in our creators\u2019 content is resonating with a broad audience.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the United States, Rumble\u2019s platform generated 8,603,000 unique viewers in February 2016 \u2014 and surpassed BuzzFeed by 500,000 visitors.

Oftentimes, companies ask me to meet for coffee to discuss finding and hiring growth marketers, and as I thought back to these coffee meetings I\u2019ve enjoyed, I realized there are several questions to be discussed.</p>\n<p>The first question is <em>how to identify a good growth marketer.</em>  In my opinion, this is best achieved by identifying the skills and mindset that the best growth marketers have in common.</p>\n<p>The second question is <em>how to find and hire a good growth marketer.</em>  Since the demand for the position is strong (and the supply increasing steadily but much more slowly), it\u2019s a sellers market for a marketer who can prove their chops. Understanding where to find these growth marketers and how to attract them are important.</p>\n<p>The third question is <em>how to onboard and integrate your new growth marketer.</em>  With this position specifically, fit and trust are extremely important, and turnover is high when goals are misaligned or fit is poor.  I\u2019ll share some thoughts and examples on how to increase your chances of success.</p>\n<h3>What\u2019s a Growth Hacker?</h3>\n<p>A growth marketer (in my estimation) is a self-sufficient, digitally savvy marketer who combines creativity, data science and technology skill sets to create a predictable marketing engine whose efficiency results in profitable customer acquisition costs, high-profit margins, and rapid growth. </p>\n<p>What characteristics do Growth Hackers have in common? Obviously, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and no one ticks all the boxes of the perfect marketer.  But from my experience, the most successful growth marketers often have these traits in common:</p>\n<h4>1.     They&#8217;re data obsessed.</h4>\n<p>Now that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a full-on quant or that they study reams of data.  What it does mean is that they identify the KPIs that are most critical to fast growth, and they obsess over a small set of statistics.  They turn buyer journeys into funnels, because it allows them to develop micro-conversions and multiple impact points, that each can be optimized independently. </p>\n<h4>2.     They are focused.</h4>\n<p>This starts with a milestone.  Every mission to massively disrupt your industry starts with a single milestone, which if set strategically, will lead to the next phase of your company\u2019s growth.  By focusing solely on the next milestone, it becomes easier to determine which initiatives to focus on and which initiatives to shelve for later.</p>\n<h4>3.     They are creative and curious.</h4>\n<p>Curiosity is the number one thing I would look for.  The great marketers I\u2019ve met ask lots of good questions and challenge assumptions.  Just like the best poker players, they read the environment and then act accordingly, playing tight when the table is loose and loose when the table is tight.  It\u2019s relatively hard to fake curiosity because it is the fuel that drives your experimentation, even when the results are underwhelming.  Creativity is the table stakes for solving old problems in new ways, and gaining meaningful competitive advantages.</p>\n<h4>4.     They\u2019re not afraid to try and fail.</h4>\n<p>They evaluate risk-reward scenarios and take many shots on net, understanding that success rarely comes from where you expect it.  They try to attack every problem with an unbiased and open mind (easier blogged than done) and understand that only 2 out of 10 experiments on average yield a statistically significant improvement.</p>\n<h4>5.     They\u2019re tenacious.</h4>\n<p>I love tenacity. To be a good growth marketer, you are really committing to a system or a process.  The road is not always golden and it\u2019s possible to flip heads 6 times in a row.  When times are tough and results are scarce, it\u2019s this tenacity turbocharged with some creativity that keeps you charging forward. </p>\n<h4>6.     They\u2019re team players.</h4>\n<p>Growth is a team sport, and growth is the connective tissue between many very important departments.  Growth cannot be achieved by one tenacious marketer \u2013 it\u2019s the result of a wonderfully choreographed effort between strategy and technology and customer service and product management, marketing, data science and more.  This role will overlap with many key roles, and the candidate must be able to function within an intense team environment.</p>\n<p>Find a good combination of a few of these and you\u2019ll be on the path to identifying a growth marketer for your team.  A few other common questions I get include:</p>\n<p><strong>1.     Are You Experienced?</strong> How much experience should this role have?  The most successful growth marketers have significant, recent experience as the skill set comes more from doing than learning.  A less experienced candidate from a successful growth team is good.  So is a one person marketing show who has demonstratable experience with customer acquisition.</p>\n<p><strong>2.     Dash-Shaped, T-Shaped or I-Shaped?</strong>  Some recruiters look for a Dash-Shaped candidate, meaning they have some experience in a wide range of areas.  Others look for T-shaped candidates, meaning someone with a wide marketing skill set and deep experience in one area.  Others look for I-Shaped candidates, who solely have deep experience in one particular area. </p>\n<p>I think it depends on the specific needs of the business.  If the business is all-in on one specific channel, I-Shaped might make sense (an example being Search Engine Optimization).  If your venture is newly funded and is selecting from a wide range of channel options, someone T-Shaped might be the best.  I\u2019d lean away from Dash-Shaped, only because it\u2019s important to have gone deep into a channel to understand how it scales.</p>\n<p><strong>3.     They\u2019re Technically-Savvy.</strong>  I picked my words carefully because this is a sensitive topic.  Facebook requires product marketers to be coders, so they can get under the hood and fix problems.  They also get thousands of  applicants for every job, so they\u2019re allowed to.  A good growth marketer is self-sufficient and is able to leverage the tools available to make marketing automation and rapid testing easy.

Here&#8217;s the latest on who raised how much, and from whom. </p>\n<h3>Gymtrack and Clearwater Clinical receive investments from FedDev Ontario</h3>\n<p>Two Ottawa-based companies are receiving a combined total of $1.45 million in funding. <a href=\"http://www.home.gymtrack.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Gymtrack</a>, which provides a virtual coaching platform, will receive up to $804,800 to bring its fitness tracking system to market. <a href=\"https://www.clearwaterclinical.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Clearwater Clinical</a>, which uses mobile tech to create alternatives to &#8220;traditional technologies&#8221;, will receive up to $650,000 to improve its mobile endoscopy tool and increase its marketing and sales activities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Governments and companies that do not embrace a culture of innovation risk being left behind,&#8221; said Navdeep Bains, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. Bains is also responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement is another clear example of our commitment to support these innovative companies here in Ottawa and, indeed, across the country.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The funding is coming from FedDev Ontario&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.feddevontario.gc.ca/eic/site/723.nsf/eng/h_00324.html\" target=\"_blank\">Investing in Business Innovation</a> initiative, and FedDev will also leverage up to $2.95 million from BDC capital and angel investors.</p>\n<h3>Semios raises $8 million in private equity financing</h3>\n<p>Vancouver-based <a href=\"http://semios.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Semios</a>, a provider of real-time agricultural information and precision pest management tools, announced it has closed an $8 million financing with private equity individuals from the agtech community, with assistance from Haywood Securities.</p>\n<p>The company will use the funding to expand sales, services, and R&#038;D efforts. \u201cWe are at a pivotal point in the company\u2019s growth with more than 50,000 sensors deployed and over 10,000 acres under management,&#8221; said Michael Gilbert, founder and CEO of Semios. &#8220;Adoption of our platform is accelerating and our growers are asking for more features and services. With this new level of investor expertise and confidence, we\u2019ll be able to expand the platform and accelerate the growth of our business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Semios&#8217; precision pest management tools combine remote access to real-time field conditions and acre-by-acre metered delivery of inputs, and the company said its IoT products enable improved deployment of pheromones, frost prevention, and optimization of irrigation schedules.</p>\n<h3>Acuva Technologies raises $850,000</h3>\n<p>Vancouver-based cleantech company <a href=\"http://www.acuvatech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Acuva Technologies</a> has raised a seed round of $850,000 for its water purification solution from BDC Capital, Vancouver-based angel investors, and the entrepreneurship@UBC (&#8220;e@UBC&#8221;) Seed Fund.  </p>\n<p>The company is working on commercializing a new microbial water purification system called Arrow that is a low-power and low-maintenance design leveraging emergent UV-LED technology, which was developed at the University of British Columbia. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Acuva&#8217;s innovative UV-LED water purification system is designed to provide potable water in a compact, low-power, low-maintenance, cost-effective system for mobile and off-grid applications,&#8221; said Acuva CEO Manoj Singh. &#8220;Our initial target markets are North American recreational boats, vehicles and cottages where we already have early sales, but our ultimate goal is to reduce the cost of our technology in order to bring it to developing country households by 2020.&#8221;</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/today-in-funding-gymtrack-clearwater-clinical-semios-acuva-technology/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Hack To Start Ep. 92: Union Square Ventures&#8217; Brittany Gorevic</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/hack-to-start-ep-92-union-square-ventures-brittany-gorevic/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/hack-to-start-ep-92-union-square-ventures-brittany-gorevic/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 21:27:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Franco Varriano]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vc]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64125</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[This week\u2019s guest is Brittany Gorevic, the General Manager at Union Square Ventures, a venture capital firm based in New York City.

The company had operated illegally in the city since 2014. In a statement to the Ottawa Citizen, Uber has said it will continue to offer its service in the city until the new bylaw comes in to effect.</p>\n<p>In legalizing Uber and other ride-sharing services, Ottawa has jumped ahead of Toronto, which only last week started to hear <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/07/over-100-recommendations-proposed-for-regulating-uber-in-toronto/\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a> on how to regulate the popular San Francisco-based startup.</p>\n<p>The new bylaw is set to create a significant new stream of revenue for the city. Under the new bylaw, the City of Ottawa will create a new \u201cprivate transportation company\u201d license category. Uber, and any other future ride-sharing companies that wish to operate in Ottawa will be classified under this category and will be required to pay a licensing fee to the city. For Uber, that fee is expected to cost $7,253. In addition, Uber will be required to pay a 11 cents per ride commission to the city.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ottawa City hall right now after legalizing Uber. Uber has to pay 11 cents per each ride. <a href=\"https://t.co/0ZhtANz1T9\">pic.twitter.com/0ZhtANz1T9</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Patrick O&#39;Rourke (@Patrick_ORourke) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Patrick_ORourke/status/720317522633998337\">April 13, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The company will also be expected to have a minimum of $2 million in insurance coverage for its drivers.</p>\n<p>While much of the bylaw focuses its attention on regulating Uber, Ottawa City Council also took steps to modernize how it governs taxi drivers and brokerages. Once the city begins enforcing the bylaw later this year, the cost of taxi licenses will decrease from $170 to $96. Moreover, taxi passengers will also no longer be required to pay a $1.50 fee for using a credit or debit card to settle their taxi fare.</p>\n<p>Despite the steps the city took to help make their business more competitive, most taxi drivers were not happy with the new bylaw. One taxi plate owner present at the session, Tony Hajjar, yelled at councillors, \u201cDo you know what the hell you are doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>The City of Ottawa will review the bylaw in one year.</p>\n<p><em>This story was originally published on <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/13/the-city-of-ottawa-has-voted-to-legalize-uber/\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/ottawa-city-council-votes-in-favour-of-legalizing-uber/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Payso winding down P2P payments to focus on business product</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/payso-winding-down-p2p-product-to-focus-on-business-product/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/payso-winding-down-p2p-product-to-focus-on-business-product/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 17:45:02 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ian Hardy]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64091</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Vancouver-based Payso, one of Canada\u2019s first peer-to-peer payment services, has decided to shut down its consumer operations and focus attention on business clientele.

The iOS and Android app launched last year and attempted to make it easy for Canadians to send and request money.</p>\n<p>FinTech, which is described as technology to make financial services more efficient, is a tough game in Canada and is still considered to be in early days.</p>\n<p>The space is dominated by Interac and PayPal, and Payso stated on its site, \u201ca year ago we set out to bring Canadians an easier, more fun and free way to share small amounts of money with friends. We had great success coast to coast and helped Canadians share nearly a million dollars in small payments between friends. It\u2019s with a heavy heart that we have decided to wind down our peer-to-peer product to focus on our <a href=\"http://www.payso.biz/\" target=\"_blank\">business product</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>For those who still have cash in their Payso wallet, Payso says it will connect with you to \u201ccash it out through the App before 24 April 2016.\u201d</p>\n<p>As for Payso\u2019s next steps, the company will be taking a conversational banking approach and white labelling its app for banks or credit unions. &#8220;Bots, AI, and conversational interfaces will have a profound impact on the way we access services on the Internet. Platforms like Messenger, Kik, Telegram, Slack, WeChat, and others are the new browsers and bots are the new websites and apps,&#8221; said Jake Tyler, founder and CEO at Payso. &#8220;As this happens we have an opportunity to re-think how banking services are delivered.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BankBot_ALL-1024x501.png\" alt=\"payso\" width=\"690\" height=\"338\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-64112\" /></a></p>\n<p>Payso has been participating in the <a href=\"http://plugandplayaccelerator.com/fintech\" target=\"_blank\">Plug and Play FinTech cohort</a> in Silicon Valley, and Tyler said that in meetings with banks from all over the world, there has been an interest in a white-labelled product like Payso. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Our view is that the biggest players in FinTech in the next three to five years will be WeChat, Facebook, Google, Apple, Kik and other major consumer tech companies,&#8221; said Tyler. &#8220;These players start by offering payments products (they already do in the US), then extend to offer basic savings, lending and other services. WeChat already does this at scale in China. We\u2019re following an opportunity with banks and credit unions, helping them to leverage their installed user base, great infrastructure and established brand to take advantage of the opportunities in mobile.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tyler confirmed that bots are a major part of the product roadmap, and pointed to his <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jaketyler/conversational-banking-from-branches-to-bots-a2e0092f957a#.nyzwlvbwn\" target=\"_blank\">Medium post</a> hinting at what the product might look like, which includes receiving and paying credit card statements, a &#8216;savings bot&#8217; to remove friction in savings accounts, and being able to send messages to a bank while travelling.</p>\n<p> &#8220;We had great success coast to coast, helping Canadians to share nearly a million dollars in small payments with friends.  We\u2019ve seen more uptake in addressing the problem in a different way so we are stopping the peer to peer product to focus on our enterprise offering.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/13/payso-shutters-its-peer-to-peer-payment-services-app/\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/payso-winding-down-p2p-product-to-focus-on-business-product/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Shopify acquires San Francisco-based virtual marketing assistant Kit</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/shopify-acquires-san-francisco-based-virtual-marketing-assistant-kit/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/shopify-acquires-san-francisco-based-virtual-marketing-assistant-kit/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 15:36:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Acquisitions]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[acquisitions]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ottawa]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64074</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[San Francisco-based Kit, which manages social marketing via SMS, has been acquired by Shopify.

I am grateful for the amount of support I\u2019ve received that allows me to do so, and I will continue to dedicate my life to this,&#8221; said Perry, who has been working in family businesses and the small business ecosystem for over 20 years. &#8220;I am ready for the next chapter and the opportunity to grow Kit at Shopify.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaking on the phone with BetaKit, Perry was still &#8220;on top of the world&#8221; following the announcement.<br />\n&#8220;We were invited to join Shopify in New York City last year for their retail tour, and I was absolutely blown away by their level of commitment to help entrepreneurs find success,&#8221; said Perry. &#8220;It inspired us as a business to work closer with them and to further push the envelope in terms of innovation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Perry said that Kit has been working with Shopify for well over a year. &#8220;In that short period of time, just through their app store, we helped thousands of businesses across 30 different countries,&#8221; said Perry. &#8220;It\u2019s been our laser focus to help small business owners across the world to be successful and now with this acquisition and partnership with Shopify, we&#8217;re not expecting to help just thousands, but tens of thousands.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kit will continue to run as an independent company under Shopify, with the entire Kit team remaining at its San Francisco office. As the service is also available through ecommerce giants like Etsy, Big Cartel, Tictail, and Bigcommerce, Perry couldn&#8217;t confirm as of yet whether Kit would become exclusive to Shopify and said those details would likely be ironed out in the near future. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Kit is still available in the app store, and over time obviously we&#8217;re looking for deeper integrations and working on other aspects of the business, things like conversational commerce, and bringing that intimacy back to the merchant-seller relationship,&#8221; said Perry. &#8220;We believe this is going to be a big piece of the pie in the future. We\u2019ll continue to build Kit and other messaging bots and products directly related to that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kit was founded in 2013, and, using SMS, users can carry out their marketing tasks. Through Kit, users can run Facebook ads and carry out sponsored content on Instagram, update fans with Facebook posts and email marketing campaigns, and send personalized thank you emails to customers \u2014 all based on the commands given through SMS. </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/shopify-acquires-san-francisco-based-virtual-marketing-assistant-kit/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Mobeewave officially opens beta of PayMeTap to kickstart the future of contactless payments</title>\n\t\t<link>http://betakit.com/mobeewave-officially-opens-beta-of-paymetap-to-kickstart-the-future-of-contactless-payments/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://betakit.com/mobeewave-officially-opens-beta-of-paymetap-to-kickstart-the-future-of-contactless-payments/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 14:55:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Launches]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Montreal]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://betakit.com/?p=64054</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Montreal-based FinTech company Mobeewave, which is dedicated to creating mobile, contactless payment solutions, is officially one step closer to realizing its vision of helping...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Montreal-based FinTech company <a href=\"http://mobeewave.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeewave</a>, which is dedicated to creating mobile, contactless payment solutions, is officially one step closer to realizing its vision of helping mobile drive the next generation of commerce \u2014 its <a href=\"http://paymetap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PayMeTap</a> application, which allows users to securely accept a payment by tapping their phone with a credit card, has officially opened out of its closed beta. </p>\n<p>Unlike offerings like Square, which target small business owners looking to accept payments more seamlessly, PayMeTap targets the everyday users looking for an easier way to process payments. Using NFC, users can tap the card they want to charge to their phone, and money is deposited to their account within 48 hours, after which they can even send a receipt. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe flexibility offered by mobile contactless payment is great, it doesn\u2019t meet all of a user\u2019s needs. People also need contactless payment services that enable them to get paid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8211; Benjamin du Ha\u00ffs\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cPeople are using it to easily pay friends and family members back; fundraisers are using it to collect donations; and service providers \u2013 like tutors, babysitters, landscapers \u2013 are using it to get paid what they\u2019re owed,\u201d said Maxime de Nanclas, COO and co-founder of Mobeewave. \u201cIt can also be an excellent way for accepting payment from people you don\u2019t know. For example, imagine you\u2019re having a garage sale. PayMeTap gives you the flexibility to accept payment by credit card for the items you\u2019re selling. And the person buying from you isn\u2019t forced to give you his personal information, his email address or sign up to the same service.   </p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, the person making the payment doesn\u2019t need to be signed up for the service, and PayMeTap doesn\u2019t store credit card information to the cloud, nor does it allow encrypted personal information to be stored on the phone. de Nanclas said that in particular, markets like Australia, Canada, and the UK \u2014 coupled with Apple and Samsung\u2019s activity in the contactless payments area \u2014 show that it will only continue to become the norm, and Mobeewave is looking to establish itself in the space early.  \u201cWhile the flexibility offered by mobile contactless payment is great, it doesn\u2019t meet all of a user\u2019s needs. Just as they have the option to make payments, people also need contactless payment services that enable them to get paid,\u201d said Benjamin du Ha\u00ffs, CEO and co-founder</p>\n<p>The app, which is available on Android, will initially launch across Canada as the company said that this is a market with high contactless payment usage \u2014 though Mobeewave which was recently selected as a finalist in the Payment and FinTech category of the eighth annual 2016 SXSW Accelerator Competition, doesn&#8217;t show signs of slowing down. It raised a <a href=\"http://betakit.com/montreals-mobeewave-raises-6-5-million-to-bolster-its-mobile-payment-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">$6.5 million series A last year</a>, and was recognized as the Best Mobile Security Solution at the 2015 SESAMES Awards organized by <a href=\"http://www.cartes-america.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CARTES SECURE CONNEXIONS.</a></p>\n<p>\u201cThe flexibility offered by mobile contactless payment is great, it doesn\u2019t meet all of a user\u2019s needs. Just as they have the option to make payments, people also need contactless payment services that enable them to get paid,\u201d said de Nanclas.  \u201cWe wanted to create a pilot campaign that offered users across Canada the chance to get paid using their mobile devices. By doing so, we hope to get a clear understanding of the kinds of people who use mobile P2P payment and how we can best meet their needs.\u201d\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://betakit.com/mobeewave-officially-opens-beta-of-paymetap-to-kickstart-the-future-of-contactless-payments/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
