We break down which team holds the edge at each position.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>For the past several years, the Western Conference Final has been considered by many to be the series that actually decides the Stanley Cup. However, this season <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/lightning-vs-penguins-advantage-position/\" target=\"_blank\">the East seems stronger than normal</a>, and none of the past four champions made it to Round 3.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Eastern Conference where one team had an easier road, neither the Sharks nor Blues had it easy. St. Louis had to slay their demons in the first round against the defending Stanley Cup champions, and while the Chicago Blackhawks weren\u2019t the team we\u2019re used to seeing, they put up a strong fight. The very next round, the Blues had to take down the Western Conference regular season champion Dallas Stars, and while their porous goaltending and an injury to <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/tyler-seguin/550752\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"550752\">Tyler Seguin</a> hurt, Dallas was still a strong team.</p>\n<p>The San Jose Sharks had to exorcise demons of their own in Round 1, taking on the Los Angeles Kings who roared back to erase a 3-0 series lead against the Sharks the last time they met. The Kings were the NHL\u2019s top possession team, but the Sharks consistently found ways to exploit <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/jonathan-quick/380901\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"380901\">Jonathan Quick</a>, leading to a shorter series than anyone would have imagined. In the second round, the Sharks took on the underrated Nashville Predators team, which was also one of the league\u2019s top possession teams with a weakness in goal the Sharks exploited. </p>\n<p>So how do the Blues and Sharks compare? Looking at playoff numbers only, let\u2019s break it down by position.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bluessharksforwards.jpg\" alt=\"bluessharksforwards\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2822061\" /></p>\n<p>The Blues have the benefit of playing teams with a more loose style than the two the Sharks faced, but across the board the Blues\u2019 forwards have been able to create higher quality chances than the Sharks have. The differences are small in almost every area, but when one team is ahead everywhere, it\u2019s more signal than noise.</p>\n<p>The big advantage the Blues have at forward is how well they carry the puck into the offensive zone and attack off the rush, moving the puck East-West more often and more successfully than the Sharks have. The Sharks are also the only team remaining that dump the puck in more often than they carry it in, which leads me to conclude that the Blues have the advantage at forward.</p>\n<p><strong>THE EDGE AT FORWARD GOES TO: ST. LOUIS</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bluessharksdef.jpg\" alt=\"bluessharksdef\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2822063\" /></p>\n<p>On defence, the Blues remain strong, exiting their own zone with control at a higher rate, blocking more passes in their own zone, keeping the pressure on by blocking clearing attempts at the opposing blueline more often, and are more involved in creating scoring chances. </p>\n<p>The Sharks defenders win more battles, but they dump the puck out much more often, giving away possession too easily. This looks like yet another advantage for the Blues.</p>\n<p><strong>THE EDGE ON DEFENCE GOES TO: ST. LOUIS</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bluessharksgoalies.jpg\" alt=\"bluessharksgoalies\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2822067\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/brian-elliott/379958\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"379958\">Brian Elliott</a> is above league average in an impressive six of eight zones in the playoffs, while <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/martin-jones/479871\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"479871\">Martin Jones</a> is above average in just three zones. This isn\u2019t enough on its own to give Elliott the nod over Jones, but the gap in Inner Slot save percentage is huge, with Jones stopping just 73.2 per cent of shots from that area, and Elliott at 78.9 per cent. </p>\n<p>Factor in that Elliott faced two teams with a high-octane offence, and Jones faced two teams that choke out defensively, and it\u2019s conclusive that Elliott has the stronger case before we get into comparing them by each zone, where Elliott is ahead of Jones in six of eight zones.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the Blues have held a fairly strong edge at every position, leading me to believe they\u2019re strong favourites to come out of the West. The big X-factor in this series though, is the Sharks\u2019 insanely effective power play, but the Blues dealt with a similar problem already in Round 1.</p>\n<p><strong>THE EDGE IN GOAL GOES TO: ST.

Here is a breakdown of the series.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Well, one of these teams will finally get the monkey off its back.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/st-louis-blues/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"st-louis-blues\" data-league=\"nhl\">St. Louis Blues</a> and San Jose Sharks are often compared to each other in terms of playoff failures. Year in and year out, these two enter the playoffs with all sorts of depth and plenty of reasons why they should be Stanley Cup contenders, but every time they&#8217;ve failed in some miserable way.</p>\n<p>This year really was different.</p>\n<p>Neither franchise has won a Stanley Cup in its history and the Blues were last in the Cup final in 1970, when they were swept by the Bruins. In fact, they made the final in each those first three years after 1967 expansion, but didn&#8217;t win a game in any.</p>\n<p>Here is a breakdown of this year&#8217;s Western Conference Final.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-13-at-12.03.00-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-05-13 at 12.03.00 AM\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2822039\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stlouisstats.jpg\" alt=\"stlouisstats\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2821839\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sjstats.jpg\" alt=\"sjstats\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2822013\" /></p>\n<p><strong>CONN SMYTHE CANDIDATE</strong><br />\n<em>St. Louis &#8212; <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/david-backes/321868\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"321868\">David Backes</a>:</em> The Blues have more than a few good candidates to pick for Conn Smythe talk. <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/brian-elliott/379958\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"379958\">Brian Elliott</a> has been a rock in net. <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/robby-fabbri/831086\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"831086\">Robby Fabbri</a> has come out of nowhere to tie for the team lead in scoring. <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/vladimir-tarasenko/550766\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"550766\">Vladimir Tarasenko</a> is equal with Fabbri at 13 points and proving one of the biggest differences between this year&#8217;s Blues and those from seasons past. But captain David Backes takes the cake here. He draws the toughest matchups, seeing major time against Jonathan Toews and Jamie Benn through the first two rounds. He&#8217;s the biggest hitter on the team and he&#8217;s third in scoring with 12 points in 14 games. He also leads all playoff scorers with three game-winning goals.</p>\n<p><em>San Jose &#8212; <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/brent-burns/229384\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229384\">Brent Burns</a>:</em> The Norris Trophy candidate has picked up in the post-season right where he left off in the regular season. In fact, he&#8217;s probably been better in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Burns is your playoff scoring leader, which is a tremendous achievement as a as a defenceman. Just a little less than half of his points have come on San Jose&#8217;s incredibly dangerous power play. Burns is such a unique player and would make for a great picture if he accepts the Conn Smythe in June.</p>\n<p><strong>Head-to-Head</strong><br />\nSt. Louis: 1-2-0<br />\nSan Jose: 2-1-0</p>\n<p><strong>LAST GAME PLAYED HEAD-TO-HEAD</strong><br />\nTheir last meeting came late in the season on March 22 and it was the first time the Blues beat the Sharks this season. The Sharks outshot the Blues 37-24 in the game, but Brian Elliott earned the shutout and Robby Fabbri scored a goal mid-way through the third period to give St. Louis the 1-0 win.<br />\n<iframe style=\"visibility: hidden;\" class=\"brightcove-iframe1629707607\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/brightcove-video-cloud/bc-iframe.php?vidid=4813420908001&#038;ap=false&#038;dataplayer=HJLhXYvZ&#038;dataaccount=1704050871&#038;uniqueid=&#038;skinclass=vjs-sportsnet&#038;autostart=false&#038;cmsid=384&#038;adserverurlparam=Video&#038;section=sportsnet%3Afeed&#038;playrollads=true\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" seamless allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\"> var SN = window.SN || {}; if (!window.SN.BrightcoveMethods) { document.write('<script src=\"/wp-content/plugins/video-js/js/brightcove-methods.js\"><\\/script>')}; </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">SN.BrightcoveMethods.register($(\".brightcove-iframe1629707607\"));</script></p>\n<p><strong>ADVANCED STATS (regular season):</strong><br />\nBlues: 5on5CF% \u2013 52.0; 5on5Sv% \u2013 .933; 5on5Sh% \u2013 7.804; PDO = 100.2<br />\nSharks: 5on5CF% \u2013 51.7; 5on5Sv% \u2013 .923; 5on5Sh% \u2013 7.79; PDO = 100.1<br />\n(via <a href=\"http://stats.hockeyanalysis.com/teamstats.php?db=201516&#038;sit=5v5&#038;disp=1&#038;sortdir=DESC&#038;sort=GFPCT\" target=\"_blank\">stats.hockeyanalysis.com</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>LAST TIME THEY MET IN THE PLAYOFFS</strong><br />\nIn 2012, the San Jose Sharks were coming off back-to-back appearances in the Western Conference Final, but went into the playoffs as the No. 7 seed. There, they met the Blues, who were back in the playoffs for just the second time in seven seasons. This was Ken Hitchcock&#8217;s first year behind the bench in St. Louis. The Sharks won Game 1 in double overtime on a Martin Havlat goal against Jaroslav Halak. But when Halak left Game 2 with an injury in came, you guessed it, Brian Elliott. The Blues shutout the Sharks in Game 2 and Elliott allowed only five goals against in the final three games as the Blues eliminated the Sharks in five games.</p>\n<p><strong>ST. LOUIS&#8217; HIGHLIGHT OF ROUND 2</strong><br />\nAfter the Stars won Game 1 they could have put the Blues in a very bad situation by taking Game 2 as well. And it nearly happened. Dallas scored two goals in the third period of Game 2, including a late marker by Jamie Benn, to force OT. The Stars outshot the Blues 13-2 in that third period, so they appeared to have all the momentum. But a little more than halfway through the first extra period, Backes put in this winner to even up the series.<br />\n<iframe style=\"visibility: hidden;\" class=\"brightcove-iframe562386810\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/brightcove-video-cloud/bc-iframe.php?vidid=4873338540001&#038;ap=false&#038;dataplayer=HJLhXYvZ&#038;dataaccount=1704050871&#038;uniqueid=&#038;skinclass=vjs-sportsnet&#038;autostart=false&#038;cmsid=384&#038;adserverurlparam=Video&#038;section=sportsnet%3Afeed&#038;playrollads=true\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" seamless allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\"> var SN = window.SN || {}; if (!window.SN.BrightcoveMethods) { document.write('<script src=\"/wp-content/plugins/video-js/js/brightcove-methods.js\"><\\/script>')}; </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">SN.BrightcoveMethods.register($(\".brightcove-iframe562386810\"));</script></p>\n<p><strong>SAN JOSE&#8217;S HIGHLIGHT OF ROUND 2</strong><br />\nWe&#8217;ll go with a beauty goal early in the series.

He also followed Kyle Lowry around screen after screen, part of Lowry\u2019s shooting swoon late in the game. Lowry eventually made the two biggest shots of the game over Richardson\u2014 a deep three-pointer and a fall-away 12-footer, makes that conspired to secure Game 5 for the Raptors. Even those shots were well contested.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a heck of a find for their team,\u201d Raptors coach Dwane Casey said on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s an excellent shooter. I don\u2019t know really what position he is. He\u2019s a basketball player.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luckily for Casey, the need to define players by their positions has been lessening for years now. (Hello, Draymond Green.) Point guard? Small forward? Power forward? Positional designations, in the age of LeBron James and the Golden State Warriors, hardly matter. Instead, players seem more like meat sacks of varied skills, with body types being only one of many important aspects. The goal, in general, is to get a nice blend of those skills on the floor at the same time, or overload on a few specific skills in the hopes of overwhelming your opponents.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"visibility: hidden;\" class=\"brightcove-iframe570676348\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/brightcove-video-cloud/bc-iframe.php?vidid=4891589006001&#038;ap=false&#038;dataplayer=HJLhXYvZ&#038;dataaccount=1704050871&#038;uniqueid=&#038;skinclass=vjs-sportsnet&#038;autostart=false&#038;cmsid=384&#038;adserverurlparam=Video&#038;section=sportsnet%3Afeed&#038;playrollads=true\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" seamless allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\"> var SN = window.SN || {}; if (!window.SN.BrightcoveMethods) { document.write('<script src=\"/wp-content/plugins/video-js/js/brightcove-methods.js\"><\\/script>')}; </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">SN.BrightcoveMethods.register($(\".brightcove-iframe570676348\"));</script></p>\n<p>That brings us to Patrick Patterson, the Toronto Raptors\u2019 starting \u2026 well, starting basketball player.</p>\n<p>Patterson came out of the University of Kentucky as the definition of a power forward. His shooting range extended to the elbows and not beyond. He would post up occasionally, breaking out the odd hook shot when he did get the ball in the post. He set screens, and generally guarded similarly skilled players.</p>\n<p>As he continued further into the duration of his rookie contract, Patterson developed his three-point shot (the basketball world quickly developed a term for that, <em>stretch four</em>, because labels are nice and easy and avoid all of this stammering). Patterson still did the things that a power forward traditionally did, and operated in the same defensive space that a power forward traditionally has, but he also shot from long distance. Simple.</p>\n<p>This year, and particularly in this series, Patterson is proving too complex for even that label. With DeMarre Carroll failing to consistently deal with Joe Johnson\u2019s width and strength, Patterson returned to the starting lineup for Game 2, with Carroll shifting down to guard Dwyane Wade.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"visibility: hidden;\" class=\"brightcove-iframe234174477\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/brightcove-video-cloud/bc-iframe.php?vidid=4890766069001&#038;ap=false&#038;dataplayer=HJLhXYvZ&#038;dataaccount=1704050871&#038;uniqueid=&#038;skinclass=vjs-sportsnet&#038;autostart=false&#038;cmsid=384&#038;adserverurlparam=Video&#038;section=sportsnet%3Afeed&#038;playrollads=true\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" seamless allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\"> var SN = window.SN || {}; if (!window.SN.BrightcoveMethods) { document.write('<script src=\"/wp-content/plugins/video-js/js/brightcove-methods.js\"><\\/script>')}; </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">SN.BrightcoveMethods.register($(\".brightcove-iframe234174477\"));</script><br />\n\u201cHe&#8217;s done a good job. He&#8217;s got the athletic ability, the speed and quickness, the power, the strength to guard a guy, an excellent one-on-one player like Joe Johnson,\u201d Casey said of Patterson. \u201cThat&#8217;s why he&#8217;s out there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s not confuse this version of Johnson to the one that tormented the Raptors two years ago as a Brooklyn Net. Johnson turns 35 next month, and is on the last legs of his career. Still, early in the series, he proved to be a matchup problem, as he was last round against the Hornets, too.</p>\n<p>Through five games, his numbers show him to be just another guy, not some sort of Raptors destroyer. He is shooting just 37 per cent from the field, and has gone only 1-for-17 from three-point range. In the first half of his career, Johnson was known as a player that could beat his man off of the dribble or lose his man coming off a screen; in the fourth quarter of Game 5, as Patterson wore down in the final of his season-high (for a game in regulation) 40 minutes, he blew by Patterson twice.</p>\n<p>The process of putting Patterson out on the perimeter to guard has been gradual. Patterson got a brief shot against Johnson in 2014, but the Raptors put that experiment into motion much more seriously this year. With Carroll\u2019s knee surgery and James Johnson\u2019s continuing James Johnsonness, Casey was looking for anybody go guard the league\u2019s thicker perimeter scorers in the league. Patterson did a particularly good job on Carmelo Anthony, and also had notable cameos against LeBron James.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s proven the fact that he can guard those guys,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThroughout the season he&#8217;s done it in certain situations, probably not for as long of a period of time as he&#8217;s done with Joe Johnson. He&#8217;s been very effective. But there are going to be different people on [Johnson]. It&#8217;s not going to just be Patrick. It&#8217;s going to be different bodies, different sizes when he backs us down into the post.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a nice bonus, Patterson and his frontcourt partner, Bismack Biyombo, both have the necessary speed and height to switch defensive options with each other. Biyombo even had to guard Wade in certain situations in Game 5, and no disasters occurred.</p>\n<p>The irony is that NBA executives are in Chicago this week for the NBA&#8217;s Draft Combine, measuring players to try to determine what they might be able to do and what their limitations could be when they get to the league. However, just think of what has happened to the Raptors on defence this post-season. Norman Powell \u2014 another player who fell through the cracks in last year\u2019s draft because his skill set did not match his body type in the traditional NBA manner \u2014 passably defended Paul George last round despite giving up five inches in height because of his foot speed, smarts and wingspan. Patterson has leveraged his size and lateral quickness to defend Johnson well.</p>\n<p>It is not one skill or measurement that matters most. It is all of them.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Basketball</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NBA</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>TOR</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11583205.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11583205.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Sharks dominate from start in Game 7 win vs. Predators</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/sharks-dominate-start-game-7-win-vs-predators/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/sharks-dominate-start-game-7-win-vs-predators//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 23:53:06 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:09:11 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2821975&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Captain Joe Pavelski got San Jose off to a fast start in Game 7 with his franchise record-tying ninth goal of the playoffs to send the Sharks to their first Western Conference final in five years with a 5-0 victory over the Nashville Predators,</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>SAN JOSE, Calif. &#8212; Captain <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/joe-pavelski/329570\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"329570\">Joe Pavelski</a> and the rest of San Jose&#8217;s big guns took little time to answer the questions about how this version of the Sharks would respond after a lackluster loss in a potential series clincher.</p>\n<p>    Pavelski got San Jose off to a fast start in Game 7 with his franchise record-tying ninth goal of the playoffs to send the Sharks to their first Western Conference final in five years with a 5-0 victory over the Nashville Predators on Thursday night.</p>\n<p>    <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/joel-ward/339914\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"339914\">Joel Ward</a>, <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/logan-couture/392950\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"392950\">Logan Couture</a>, <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/joe-thornton/170656\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"170656\">Joe Thornton</a> and <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/patrick-marleau/170699\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"170699\">Patrick Marleau</a> also scored as San Jose shook off an overtime loss in Game 6 to reach the conference final for the fourth time in franchise history.</p>\n<p>    &#34;As soon as the puck dropped tonight, the guys were going,&#34; Thornton said. &#34;It was nice to see. It was a huge game for us. I&#8217;m just glad we came on the good side tonight.&#34;</p>\n<p>    <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/martin-jones/479871\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"479871\">Martin Jones</a> made 20 saves for San Jose&#8217;s first playoff shutout in six years. The home team won all seven games in this series.</p>\n<p>    After blowing a 3-0 series lead to Los Angeles in 2014 in their most noteworthy in a long list of playoff collapses and missing the postseason entirely last year, the Sharks are now one round away from advancing to the Stanley Cup final for the first time in franchise history.</p>\n<p>    San Jose will open the conference final on the road Sunday against the St. Louis Blues.</p>\n<p>    &#34;It never gets easier,&#34; Pavelski said. &#34;These teams are all good right now, good goalies. It feels good, but we understand this was a second step. It feels good, but we have to keep going.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The Predators&#8217; most successful season ended in bitter disappointment as they were unable to repeat their Game 7 road win in the first round against Anaheim to make the conference final for the first time.</p>\n<p>    Defensive miscues by Nashville&#8217;s two top defensemen, captain <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/shea-weber/231127\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"231127\">Shea Weber</a> and Roman Josi, led to early San Jose goals as <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/pekka-rinne/297473\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"297473\">Pekka Rinne</a> got little help from his teammates.</p>\n<p>    The Predators had just eight shots on goal in the first two periods and Rinne left after allowing goals to Thornton and Marleau early in the third period. The frustration boiled over as he slammed his stick against the post and tossed it aside after Marleau&#8217;s goal made it 5-0. Carter Hutton replaced Rinne in goal and made one save.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"visibility: hidden;\" class=\"brightcove-iframe36816213\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/brightcove-video-cloud/bc-iframe.php?vidid=4891369591001&#038;ap=false&#038;dataplayer=HJLhXYvZ&#038;dataaccount=1704050871&#038;uniqueid=&#038;skinclass=vjs-sportsnet&#038;autostart=false&#038;cmsid=384&#038;adserverurlparam=Video&#038;section=sportsnet%3Afeed&#038;playrollads=true\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" seamless allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\"> var SN = window.SN || {}; if (!window.SN.BrightcoveMethods) { document.write('<script src=\"/wp-content/plugins/video-js/js/brightcove-methods.js\"><\\/script>')}; </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">SN.BrightcoveMethods.register($(\".brightcove-iframe36816213\"));</script><br />\n    &#34;That was childish and not the way you want to end the season,&#34; Rinne said. &#34;I wish I hadn&#8217;t have done that. Yeah, it was frustration. That&#8217;s the end of that stick.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Nashville remains one of three franchises, along with Columbus and the current Winnipeg franchise, to never make it to a conference final.</p>\n<p>    The Sharks got there in 2004, 2010 and 2011 &#8212; only to lose each time as a long run of regular-season success behind stars such as Thornton and Marleau has not yet led to the ultimate postseason goal.</p>\n<p>    The 2014 collapse set the franchise back and led to Thornton losing his captaincy amid several other changes the past two years. But with only 10 players remaining from that disappointment and a new coach in Peter DeBoer, the Sharks believed this team was different and are showing that through two rounds of the playoffs.</p>\n<p>    &#34;The core guys are still the same, but the core guys here are great,&#34; DeBoer said. &#34;They have great habits, they&#8217;ve been well coached for a decade by the previous staff that was here. They&#8217;re not the problem. It was filling in behind them. We&#8217;ve got those type of people here now, and I think the guys at the top feel that and are feeding off it.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The Sharks came out fast from the drop and completely dominated the opening period, outshooting Nashville 17-3 to take a 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>    San Jose&#8217;s potent top power-play unit made Nashville pay for a delay of game penalty on Game 6 overtime hero Viktor Arvidsson when Marleau set up Pavelski with a pass from behind the net for a one-timer to open the scoring. It was Pavelski&#8217;s ninth goal this postseason, tying the franchise record he and Marleau already held.</p>\n<p>    The Predators came close to scoring on one flurry in front of Jones&#8217; net, but the Sharks ended up adding to the lead when Josi misplayed a puck at the blue line, sending Ward in on a breakaway that made it 2-0.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"visibility: hidden;\" class=\"brightcove-iframe1390786355\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/brightcove-video-cloud/bc-iframe.php?vidid=4891247922001&#038;ap=false&#038;dataplayer=HJLhXYvZ&#038;dataaccount=1704050871&#038;uniqueid=&#038;skinclass=vjs-sportsnet&#038;autostart=false&#038;cmsid=384&#038;adserverurlparam=Video&#038;section=sportsnet%3Afeed&#038;playrollads=true\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" seamless allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\"> var SN = window.SN || {}; if (!window.SN.BrightcoveMethods) { document.write('<script src=\"/wp-content/plugins/video-js/js/brightcove-methods.js\"><\\/script>')}; </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">SN.BrightcoveMethods.register($(\".brightcove-iframe1390786355\"));</script><br />\n    The break between periods did little to slow the Sharks as they scored in the opening minute of the second period when Weber turned a puck over right to Couture in the defensive zone.

They deserved it.&#34;</p>\n<p>    <B>NOTES:</B> Josi and Weber were on the ice for all five San Jose goals. &#8230; Couture&#8217;s 11 points in the series breaks the franchise record of 10 set by Igor Larionov in San Jose&#8217;s first series ever in 1994 against Detroit.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Hockey</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NHL</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/kanter_enes.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/kanter_enes.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Thunder roll over Spurs in Game 6 to reach Conference Finals</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/thunder-roll-spurs-game-6-reach-conference-finals/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/thunder-roll-spurs-game-6-reach-conference-finals//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 23:10:44 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:51:39 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2821947&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Kevin Durant scored 37 points, Russell Westbrook added 28, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the San Antonio Spurs 113-99 on Thursday night to win the Western Conference semifinal series 4-2.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>OKLAHOMA CITY &#8212; The Thunder flipped the script, and now they&#8217;re heading to the Western Conference finals.</p>\n<p>    Tim Duncan doesn&#8217;t know yet where he&#8217;s headed as the <a href=\"/basketball/nba/teams/san-antonio-spurs/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"san-antonio-spurs\" data-league=\"nba\">San Antonio Spurs</a> face an uncertain future.</p>\n<p>    Kevin Durant scored 37 points, Russell Westbrook added 28, and Oklahoma City beat San Antonio 113-99 on Thursday night to win the Western Conference semifinal series 4-2.</p>\n<p>    Oklahoma City lost 124-92 in Game 1, but first-year coach Billy Donovan led the Thunder to victory in four of the next five. Oklahoma City controlled Game 6, leading by as many as 28 points.</p>\n<p>    Westbrook said the Thunder never lost confidence.</p>\n<p>    &#34;We had that game, and we left it behind us,&#34; he said. &#34;We came out after that and had a different mindset. We knew what we had to do to win the series. They&#8217;re a great team. They&#8217;ve been winning for 10-plus years, same pace. I&#8217;m just proud of our guys.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Steven Adams had 15 points and 11 rebounds, and Andre Roberson added 14 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City now will face defending NBA champion Golden State, starting Monday in Oakland, California.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Golden State&#8217;s a great team,&#34; Donovan said. &#34;It will be a great challenge. We&#8217;ve got a little bit of time to prepare before we play, but right now, for us, it&#8217;s just to enjoy the opportunity to move on, get a chance to continue to play and get as prepared as we can going into Game 1.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The Spurs were trying to extend the winningest season in franchise history after going 67-15. The 40-year-old Duncan struggled for much of the series before scoring 19 points as San Antonio tried to fight back in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>    Duncan didn&#8217;t clear anything up about his future after the game. He has a player option for next season.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I&#8217;ll get to that after I get out of here and figure life out,&#34; he said.</p>\n<p>    Kawhi Leonard scored 22 points and LaMarcus Aldridge added 18 for the Spurs. San Antonio lost just once at home during the regular season, but the Thunder beat the Spurs twice in San Antonio during the series.</p>\n<p>    In Game 6, Oklahoma City opened up a 47-29 lead late in the second quarter after a 3-pointer by Westbrook that brought a roar from the crowd. Durant&#8217;s 3-pointer with 2.3 seconds left in the half pushed the lead to 55-31 at the break. Durant scored 18 points in the first half and Westbrook added 13.</p>\n<p>    The Thunder looked like the Spurs often do in the first half, running an efficient offense while committing just three turnovers.</p>\n<p>    It was a season-low point total for the Spurs in a first half. San Antonio shot 31.1 percent from the field before the break and missed all nine of its 3-pointers.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I thought they did a great job of coming out and punching us in the stomach,&#34; Leonard said. &#34;But we got some open looks that didn&#8217;t go down, turned over the ball a couple of times, and that&#8217;s all on me.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Oklahoma City kept the pressure on and led 91-65 at the end of the third quarter.</p>\n<p>    The veteran Spurs had one last surge left and got as close as 11, but a 3-pointer by Westbrook, then a driving layup by Westbrook, killed San Antonio&#8217;s momentum for good.</p>\n<p>    &#34;We always give credit to our opponents, and obviously, OKC turned it up there and turned our execution into forced bad shots, and then we kind of trickled down from there and it snowballed,&#34; Duncan said. &#34;We put ourselves in the hole. We actually played somewhat solid for the second half but it was too little, too late.&#34;</p>\n<p>    &#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p>    STAT LINES</p>\n<p>    The Thunder dominated the boards in the series, winning the rebounding battle in five of the six games.

He has rounded into form nicely since his return and has averaged 9.7 points, 4.1 rebounds and 31.5 minutes a game in the post-season.</p>\n<p>    Speaking to reporters Thursday at the team&#8217;s practice facility, Carroll said he initially thought he broke a bone when he landed awkwardly on the court after getting tangled up with a Miami player in Toronto&#8217;s 99-91 victory in Game 5 on Wednesday night. X-rays were negative and the injury is officially described as a contusion.</p>\n<p>    &#34;If it ain&#8217;t broke, with me, I&#8217;m ready to play,&#34; said Carroll, who had a support on his injured wrist.</p>\n<p>    Carroll added that his wrist went numb for a few minutes after the fall and now he&#8217;s just battling soreness. Regular treatment is planned for Thursday and Friday.</p>\n<p>    &#34;It&#8217;s all about how I can tolerate my pain,&#34; he said. &#34;But I&#8217;m not a junkyard dog for nothing, right? So we&#8217;ll see what happens.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Toronto also had a 3-2 lead in its first-round series against Indiana. The Raptors lost Game 6 on the road before closing out the seven-game series at home.</p>\n<p>    Toronto has a 2-5 all-time record in possible series-clinching games.</p>\n<p>    &#34;This is that time of year,&#34; said Raptors coach Dwane Casey. &#34;You better come out with your guns loaded and ready to go.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The first five games of the series have been quite physical and several players are banged up on both sides. Toronto has already lost centre Jonas Valanciunas (ankle) for the series and can ill afford the loss of another key player.</p>\n<p>    Carroll, who injured the wrist on his non-shooting hand, has been a key factor at both ends of the floor. His defensive play on Miami star Dwyane Wade has been impressive.</p>\n<p>    &#34;You can&#8217;t make excuses,&#34; Carroll said. &#34;You&#8217;re in the NBA for a reason. We get paid a lot of money for a reason. So we&#8217;ve just got to go out there and perform.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Carroll said he has been working closely with team sport science director Alex McKechnie, who told him to take a day-by-day approach to the injury.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Me being who I am, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m going to fight him and play tomorrow,&#34; Carroll said.</p>\n<p>    Casey said that if the team&#8217;s medical staff feels Carroll is ready to return, that he will be used as a starter in Game 6.</p>\n<p>    Game 7, if necessary, would be played Sunday afternoon at Air Canada Centre. The series winner will face the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers for a berth in the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>    <b>Notes:</b> Casey said there was no update on DeMar DeRozan&#8217;s sore thumb but added he&#8217;d be &#34;ready to go&#34; on Friday. DeRozan tied his playoff high with 34 points in Game 5. &#8230; Toronto was 11-3 in regular-season games when both Carroll and Valanciunas weren&#8217;t in the lineup. &#8230; The Raptors are one of four active NBA teams that have never reached a conference final. The others are Charlotte, New Orleans and the Los Angeles Clippers.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Basketball</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NBA</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>MIA</team>\n\t\t\t<team>TOR</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/darryl_sutter.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/darryl_sutter.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Report: Darryl Sutter agrees to new contract with Kings</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/darryl-sutter-contract-well-get-worked/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/darryl-sutter-contract-well-get-worked//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:03:01 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:54:15 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Ryan McKenna</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2821369&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Darryl Sutter has reportedly agreed to a new contract to remain head coach of the Los Angeles Kings.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Darryl Sutter has agreed to a new contract with the <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/los-angeles-kings/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"los-angeles-kings\" data-league=\"nhl\">Los Angeles Kings</a>, according to a report from Lisa Dillman of the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.</p>\n<p><a class=\"embedly-card\" href=\"https://twitter.com/reallisa/status/730860016262074369\">lisa dillman on Twitter</a><br />\n<script async src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script></p>\n<p><a class=\"embedly-card\" href=\"https://twitter.com/reallisa/status/730860166317412352\">lisa dillman on Twitter</a><br />\n<script async src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script></p>\n<p><a class=\"embedly-card\" href=\"https://twitter.com/reallisa/status/730860528273231872\">lisa dillman on Twitter</a><br />\n<script async src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/los-angeles-kings/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"los-angeles-kings\" data-league=\"nhl\">Kings</a> head coach <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/kings/la-sp-sn-kings-darryl-sutter-20160512-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> earlier Thursday</a> that he planned to remain with the organization next season.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m under contract until July 1,\u201d Sutter said. \u201cI have no desire to go anywhere else or do any of that.

So with two chances to close out the Heat the Raptors are now pegged as the <a href=\"http://www.oddsshark.com/nba/2016-nba-playoffs-series-prices\">-350 favourites on the series odds</a> \u2013 with Miami at +275.</p>\n<p>The Heat, however, are listed <a href=\"http://www.oddsshark.com/nba/odds\">as 4-point favourites at home</a> for Game 6 of the set on Friday.</p>\n<p>The Raptors took a 3-2 lead in the series on Wednesday thanks to strong efforts from their two all-star guards, with DeMar DeRozan scoring a team-high 34 points on the night and Lowry adding 25 points and 10 rebounds in the contest. Filling in for the injured Jonas Valanciunas as the starting centre, Bismack Biyombo scored 10 points in the Game 5 victory.</p>\n<p>Dwyane Wade scored 20 points for the Heat in Game 5, and Goran Dragic added 13 points.</p>\n<p>Toronto covered the posted spread at the sportsbooks for the second time in three games on Wednesday night after they&#8217;d been tagged with six straight losses against the spread dating back to its first-round series against the <a class=\"sn-team-post-link\" href=\"/basketball/nba/teams/indiana-pacers/\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"indiana-pacers\" data-league=\"nba\"><a href=\"/basketball/nba/teams/indiana-pacers/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"indiana-pacers\" data-league=\"nba\">Indiana Pacers</a></a>. Miami, though, still holds a 3-2 ATS edge in the series, with the OVER/UNDER having gone 2-2-1 through the first five games.</p>\n<p>Valanciunas has already been ruled out for the remainder of the series with the Heat due to an\u00a0ankle injury, while Miami counterpart Hassan Whiteside has been ruled out for Game 6 with a knee injury. Heat forward Luol Deng suffered a bruised wrist in Game 5 and is considered questionable for Friday, while Raptors forward DeMarre Carroll also suffered a wrist injury in Game 5 but is fully expected to play in <a href=\"http://www.oddsshark.com/nba/toronto-miami-odds-may-13-2016-729691\">Game 6 at American Airlines Arena</a>.</p>\n<p>If Toronto can close out Miami on Friday night it&#8217;ll move on to face LeBron James and the <a class=\"sn-team-post-link\" href=\"/basketball/nba/teams/cleveland-cavaliers/\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"cleveland-cavaliers\" data-league=\"nba\"><a href=\"/basketball/nba/teams/cleveland-cavaliers/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"cleveland-cavaliers\" data-league=\"nba\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a></a> in the Eastern Conference finals. The Raptors and Cavaliers met three times during the regular season, with Toronto going 2-1 both straight up and against the spread in those contests according to the <a

We break down which team holds the edge at each position.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>As we gear up for the conference finals, the road gets tougher for almost everyone. However, it\u2019s an odd situation in the East. The <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/tampa-bay-lightning/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"tampa-bay-lightning\" data-league=\"nhl\">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> were the first team to qualify for the final four, even without two key players: their top scorer and captain, and their second-best defenceman. </p>\n<p>Tampa had a simpler road to this point than most teams in recent memory, completely overmatching the Detroit Red Wings and New York Islanders.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/pittsburgh-penguins/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"pittsburgh-penguins\" data-league=\"nhl\">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>, meanwhile, had a similarly simple series in the first round, then took out the Presidents\u2019 Trophy winners in six games in the second round, despite an injury to Olli Maatta and a suspension to <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/kris-letang/339745\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"339745\">Kris Letang</a>. </p>\n<p>The Penguins have undoubtedly faced a tougher route to get to this point, but a big factor here is how each team is playing heading into this series. Looking at playoff numbers only, we can see how the Penguins and Lightning compare to each other, broken down by position.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EFforwards.jpg\" alt=\"EFforwards\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2821737\" /></p>\n<p>Both teams are producing fewer scoring chances than they were in the regular season, which is probably to be expected in the playoffs since teams play much tighter on defence.</p>\n<p>The Lightning are producing more chances than the Penguins so far, but they\u2019re getting the same amount on net, and they\u2019ve also played weaker defensive teams. The Lightning are making more passes to the slot and moving the puck East-West a bit more, however the Penguins have a significant advantage in controlled entries, suggesting that with equal strength of opponents, Pittsburgh might be a bit more dangerous off the rush. </p>\n<p>With the luxury of splitting <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/sidney-crosby/296786\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"296786\">Sidney Crosby</a>, <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/evgeni-malkin/268144\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"268144\">Evgeni Malkin</a>, and <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/phil-kessel/329565\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"329565\">Phil Kessel</a> up into three attacking lines, and scoring chances being mostly a wash despite tougher competition, the Penguins have a significant advantage at forward unless <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/steven-stamkos/456624\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"456624\">Steven Stamkos</a> suddenly comes back 100 per cent healthy.</p>\n<p><strong>THE EDGE AT FORWARD GOES TO: PITTSBURGH<br />\n</strong><br />\n<img src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EFdefencemen.jpg\" alt=\"EFdefencemen\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2821739\" /></p>\n<p>The defensive breakdown between the two teams is almost a battle of two different styles of play. The Lightning defencemen move the puck more efficiently, breaking out of their own zone with possession more often, boasting a lower turnover rate (not shown on the graph), and they are more involved in creating scoring chances. </p>\n<p>The Penguins, meanwhile, are more disruptive of the opponents\u2019 attack, blocking more passes, and recovering more loose pucks by winning more battles in their own zone. They also dump the puck out almost twice as often, which is inefficient, but can also relieve pressure.</p>\n<p>Considering a smooth transition game that keeps the puck in your team\u2019s control usually leads to better offence and defence, and that <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/anton-stralman/383710\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"383710\">Anton Stralman</a> is likely to return early in this series, I think the Lightning have a strong advantage on defence. </p>\n<p><strong>THE EDGE ON DEFENCE GOES TO: TAMPA BAY</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EFgoalies.jpg\" alt=\"EFgoalies\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2821741\" /></p>\n<p>Before we dig in on the goalies, note that the y-axis is set to start at 70 per cent. This is to accentuate the differences, as going from 0-100 per cent can make it a bit more difficult, and there aren\u2019t many goaltenders you expect to be below 70 per cent save percentage in any zone.</p>\n<p>Goaltending in this series is experience versus youth, with two very solid, very large goalies who have been stellar in the playoffs. Bishop has been in this position before, but <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/matt-murray/680827\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"680827\">Matt Murray</a> has been the star of the playoffs. </p>\n<p>Both Murray and Bishop are above league average in five of eight zones, with Murray holding the slight edge in the Inner Slot area. Murray bests Bishop in five of the eight zones, including two of three slot zones and the Center Point, which are the four-highest shooting percentage areas. </p>\n<p>This matchup is probably the closest of all three positional battles, but Murray has simply been better, so the advantage goes to the Penguins. Consider them the favourite to win this series.</p>\n<p><strong>THE EDGE IN GOAL GOES TO: PITTSBURGH</strong></p>\n<p><script>\n  (function(d, s, id){\n    var js,\n        fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\n        p = (('https:' == d.location.protocol) ?

High performance, the mental side, strength and conditioning, sports science, what can we learn about these players that we feel will not only be indicative of future success, but help them transition into our organization better should we take them.\u201d</p>\n<p>How successfully the old and new meld may very well dictate whether or not the Blue Jays are successful in the <span data-term=\"goog_1727555853\">June 9</span>&#8211;<span data-term=\"goog_1727555854\">11\u00a0</span>draft. Every draft is important, but this year is particularly significant given the way Anthopoulos thinned out the system during last summer\u2019s trade deadline spree.</p>\n<p>With the 21st, 57<sup>th</sup> (as compensation for not signing Brady Singer) and 66<sup>th</sup> picks, there\u2019s an opportunity to replenish the organization and a signing bonus pool of $6,603,300 gives the Blue Jays the option of shifting the money around should someone unexpectedly drop.</p>\n<p>Both assistant GM Andrew Tinnish, when he was scouting director, and Parker have employed such a strategy in the past, although an argument can be made that spreading the wealth may be the wiser play given all the lost inventory.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf there are opportunities to maximize every single dollar you have, no question that we will be looking to do that,\u201d says Atkins. \u201cThe bulk of our time will be spent on learning what makes a player, what motivates a player, what drives a player, ultimately how important baseball is to them, and how well they\u2019re going to fit into our culture and environment. Where there are opportunities to create more of that for our system, we\u2019ll always look to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another thing to watch for is whether the Blue Jays move off their prioritization of starting pitching and premium position players early in the draft. In the six drafts under Anthopoulos, the Blue Jays used their eight first-round picks to select six pitchers, a centre-fielder and a catcher. Pitchers were the overwhelming preference in the subsequent rounds, as well, since Anthopoulos viewed them as the toughest commodity to obtain at the big-league level and coveted assets for potential trades.</p>\n<p>Asked about his general philosophies, Atkins says, \u201cReally, we try to value what history tells us, and try to connect the dots backwards to determine what has worked in the past, what has been indicative of future success and how do we create the most value in this draft. So it\u2019s not position specific, it\u2019s not need specific, it\u2019s value and based on history.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atkins is coy about what history says, but it\u2019s likely that the Blue Jays, like most other clubs, will do some sort of draft modelling to track what type of players from which developmental streams most typically succeed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to learn where there are opportunities and where our collective experiences tell us things are going to be indicative of future success about certain players,\u201d is how Atkins explains it. \u201cMuch less driven by stats, and more driven by insight, people\u2019s experiences, past occurrences and things that have occurred in the draft previously.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Blue Jays have also taken more risks in the draft, often leaning toward high school players with big upside. A factor to consider this year is that the club\u2019s prospect base is in the lower-levels of the farm system and with a gap at the upper levels, drafting some college players, who tend to advance quicker, might make some sense as a way to balance the organization.</p>\n<p>Still, Atkins is adamant that urgency won\u2019t be a factor in the draft, and that decisions will be made based on who the team feels is the best player available, regardless of other factors.</p>\n<p>That may also lead\u00a0the Blue Jays to\u00a0lock in on players at premium positions.</p>\n<p>\u201cOverall that\u2019s generally a good philosophy because middle of the diamond typically signifies athleticism and it\u2019s easier to move off the middle than it is to the middle,\u201d says Atkins. \u201cBut there are so many pieces to the equation. It could be a college right-fielder who is an incredible bat, Kyle Schwarber (of the Cubs) would be a great example, that I don\u2019t think the entire industry was confident that he was going to be a catcher, but people were buying on the bat. So there are exceptions to every philosophy, and the most important thing to do is not paint yourself into a box and make sure you\u2019re getting everything out of the best resources available to understand more about players.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Blue Jays\u2019 period of learning will soon be over, with a test that can significantly impact the organization looming.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Baseball</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>MLB</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11497008.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11497008.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Raptors Notebook: Toronto just one win away from the unthinkable</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/raptors-notebook-toronto-just-one-win-away-unthinkable/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/raptors-notebook-toronto-just-one-win-away-unthinkable//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:07:21 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 23:04:08 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Sportsnet Staff</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2821263&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Bismack Biyombo, Demarre Carroll, and Dwane Casey met with the media before flying off to Miami Thursday and talked about what the Raptors need to do to finish the job. </p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>What started out as a blowout/statement performance turned into a stress-inducing nail-biter as the Raptors narrowly edged the Miami Heat 99-91 in a game that was closer than the final score suggests.</p>\n<p>But despite the lapse in the second half (and, really, given how this series had gone did you really expect other than for this game to be decided in the final minute?), it was perhaps the most encouraging win against the Heat thus far.</p>\n<p>Bismack Biyombo put his stamp on the game with four blocks and his signature relentlessness, making a Valanciunas-less world seem a little more acceptable. And, more importantly, the Raps got major contributions from <em>both</em> Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, replicating the formula that earned Toronto a franchise-best second-seed and 56 regular season wins. Couple that with the Miami Heat\u2019s struggles (read: every player who\u2019s not Dwyane Wade) and there is reason for optimism.</p>\n<p>On Thursday the team travelled to Miami, where they\u2019ll have an opportunity to stamp their ticket to the Eastern Conference Finals, a sentence that long-time Raptors fans may have never thought they\u2019d never read. But before they embarked to South Beach, some players met with the media. Here\u2019s what they had to say.</p>\n<p><strong>Carroll injury fallout</strong></p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t look good when DeMarre Carroll exited Wednesday night\u2019s game after falling squarely on his left wrist during the third quarter. Carroll was clearly in pain and made a beeline for the locker room where an MRI determined there was no bone breaks. Which came as a surprise to Carroll, who says he assumed it was broken when his entire wrist immediately went numb upon impact.</p>\n<p>Carroll, perhaps the most likely on the Raps roster to play through an injury, was quite optimistic about the injury and voiced more concern over the fact that while he was nursing his wrist during the 4th quarter, the Raptors let the Heat back into the game:</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"visibility: hidden;\" class=\"brightcove-iframe1874481004\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/brightcove-video-cloud/bc-iframe.php?vidid=4890766069001&#038;ap=false&#038;dataplayer=HJLhXYvZ&#038;dataaccount=1704050871&#038;uniqueid=&#038;skinclass=vjs-sportsnet&#038;autostart=false&#038;cmsid=384&#038;adserverurlparam=Video&#038;section=sportsnet%3Afeed&#038;playrollads=true\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" seamless allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\"> var SN = window.SN || {}; if (!window.SN.BrightcoveMethods) { document.write('<script src=\"/wp-content/plugins/video-js/js/brightcove-methods.js\"><\\/script>')}; </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">SN.BrightcoveMethods.register($(\".brightcove-iframe1874481004\"));</script>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Calming Casey</strong></p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s dealing with his own teams\u2019 injuries or figuring out how to matchup with atypical lineups (ie. Miami playing Joe Johnson at centre and Justise Winslow at power forward for long stretches on Wednesday), Raptors coach Dwane Casey has certainly been put to the test throughout the playoffs\u2014and is putting up some strong grades in the process.</p>\n<p>But on Thursday the coach, who has won a championship as an assistant in Dallas, stressed how important it is to remain even keeled after both wins and losses. That same sense of calm, he said, applies to the injury bug that has befallen his team, noting that the Raptors have already showed they are capable of playing without both Valanciunas and Carroll, who missed a combined 77 games during the regular season. It places an even greater workload on the likes of DeRozan and Lowry, but also leaves the door open for the \u201cnext man up\u201d, something that Biyombo, Terrence Ross, and Cory Joseph have all embraced so far in the Heat series.</p>\n<p>Casey also mentioned that he has no real update on DeRozan\u2019s thumb injury\u2014 because his star player doesn\u2019t like to talk about it\u2014but acknowledged that a slumping scorer just needs to watch the ball go through the hoop a few times (as was the case early in Game 5), and that DeRozan\u2019s defense had been solid when his shot wasn\u2019t falling. Still, the coach saw some things he knows his team needs to correct heading into Friday\u2019s Game 6, perhaps none more critical than their transition defense, which resulted in a number of wide-open three-point attempts for Miami down the stretch. </p>\n<p><strong>Open for Bizness</strong><br />\nBismack Biyombo has been a revelation all season long, the kind of player the Charlotte Hornets were hoping he\u2019d develop into when they acquired him at the 2011 draft. It never quite happened in Charlotte, but Biyombo has found a home in Toronto where he\u2019s been given a role that suits him perfectly. Too bad there\u2019s a chance that home could be temporary. Biyombo is due for a hefty raise this summer and should the Raptors re-sign DeMar DeRozan they almost surely won\u2019t have near enough to bring Biyombo back, too.</p>\n<p>Which is too bad, because Biyombo not only plays the right way but when you put a mic in front of his face he says all the right things, too. Here he is talking about what the Raptors need to do to finish the job vs. Miami:</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"visibility: hidden;\" class=\"brightcove-iframe1455664539\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/brightcove-video-cloud/bc-iframe.php?vidid=4890819800001&#038;ap=false&#038;dataplayer=HJLhXYvZ&#038;dataaccount=1704050871&#038;uniqueid=&#038;skinclass=vjs-sportsnet&#038;autostart=false&#038;cmsid=384&#038;adserverurlparam=Video&#038;section=sportsnet%3Afeed&#038;playrollads=true\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" seamless allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\"> var SN = window.SN || {}; if (!window.SN.BrightcoveMethods) { document.write('<script src=\"/wp-content/plugins/video-js/js/brightcove-methods.js\"><\\/script>')}; </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">SN.BrightcoveMethods.register($(\".brightcove-iframe1455664539\"));</script></p>\n<p><strong>BONUS!</strong><br />\nHey look, it&#8217;s a non-story story!

Yet some of the most important notes had nothing to do with the play on the field, but were instead reminders to make the most of his chance to call a major league game from Tiger Stadium.</p>\n<p>The reminders must have worked. Howarth still calls every Blue Jays game today.</p>\n<p>Hover over the annotations below to hear some of Jerry&#8217;s calls from the game (plus, a bonus call from Tom Cheek) and explanations of how he uses his scoresheet to document the game in such vivid detail.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/787332567559831552/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-787332567559831552;1043138249'\" class=\"alwaysThinglink\"/><script async charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js\"></script></p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Baseball</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>MLB</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/alex-ovechkin-jimmy-fallon.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/alex-ovechkin-jimmy-fallon.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Jimmy Fallon pokes fun at NHL stars with Tonight Show superlatives</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/jimmy-fallon-pokes-fun-nhl-stars-tonight-show-superlatives/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/jimmy-fallon-pokes-fun-nhl-stars-tonight-show-superlatives//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:11:27 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:11:27 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Mike Johnston</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2821009&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Jimmy Fallon unleashed his latest batch of NHL superlatives.

When the <a class=\"sn-team-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/nashville-predators/\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"nashville-predators\" data-league=\"nhl\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/nashville-predators/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"nashville-predators\" data-league=\"nhl\">Nashville Predators</a></a> knocked off the <a class=\"sn-team-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/anaheim-ducks/\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"anaheim-ducks\" data-league=\"nhl\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/anaheim-ducks/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"anaheim-ducks\" data-league=\"nhl\">Anaheim Ducks</a></a> in seven, that set San Jose up with an unexpected home ice advantage, and they used it to jump out to a 2-0 series lead. After years of playoff disappointment, it looked like everything was falling into place for the Sharks to finally exceed expectations, and maybe even win the franchise&#8217;s first Stanley Cup.</p>\n<p>Things change quickly in the post-season. After failing to close out the series in Nashville on Monday, the Sharks now face a Game 7 tonight \u2014 one that most didn&#8217;t think they&#8217;d need against the wildcard Predators.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2818561\" src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SCP_TWITTER_MULTI_-ROUND2_MAY12_TON.jpg\" alt=\"SCP_TWITTER_MULTI_-ROUND2_MAY12_TON\" width=\"100%\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<p>The Sharks still head into tonight as the favourite; they&#8217;ve got home ice, and have won all three games played at the SAP Center in the series. They&#8217;re the better team on paper. And a win would send them to a Conference Final matchup against the <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/st-louis-blues/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"st-louis-blues\" data-league=\"nhl\">St. Louis Blues</a> that they&#8217;d have a good chance to win.</p>\n<p>But a loss\u2026 a loss, and we&#8217;re right back to where we always seems to be with this team. So today, let&#8217;s take a look back over the Sharks&#8217; history of playoff disappointment.</p>\n<p><strong>1991 \u2013 1999: THE EARLY YEARS</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> We&#8217;ll lump the first eight years of franchise history into one entry, since they really didn&#8217;t have anything to do with the Sharks&#8217; current reputation. After two years of record-breaking expansion futility, the Sharks broke through with their first decent season in 1993-94, making the playoffs and then shocking the <a class=\"sn-team-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/detroit-red-wings/\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"detroit-red-wings\" data-league=\"nhl\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/detroit-red-wings/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"detroit-red-wings\" data-league=\"nhl\">Detroit Red Wings</a></a> in the opening round.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;d win another round in 1995, this time against the <a class=\"sn-team-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/calgary-flames/\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"calgary-flames\" data-league=\"nhl\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/calgary-flames/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"calgary-flames\" data-league=\"nhl\">Calgary Flames</a></a> in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT4mFuLcLQM\" target=\"_blank\">Game 7 OT</a>, before suffering through two more miserable years followed by two years of first round exits.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> Any playoff loss hurts, but it would be hard to call any of these post-season performances a disappointment. The Sharks were never favoured, and in fact were never even a .500 team. And looking back, only their second round matchup against the <a class=\"sn-team-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/toronto-maple-leafs/\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"toronto-maple-leafs\" data-league=\"nhl\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/toronto-maple-leafs/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"toronto-maple-leafs\" data-league=\"nhl\">Toronto Maple Leafs</a></a> in 1994, in which they were one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHeS3VppOko\" target=\"_blank\">Johan Garpenlov crossbar</a> away from advancing, feels like a series that got away.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 2/10. Sure, the first few years of incompetence were rough. But those upsets against the Red Wings and Flames were fun, and the rest of it pretty much played out according to script.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2000</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> The Sharks crack the .500 mark for the first time in franchise history. That&#8217;s enough to sneak them into the playoffs as an eight seed, where they draw the Presidents&#8217; Trophy-winning Blues. Nobody gives them much of a chance, but they jump out to a 3-1 series lead before pulling off a Game 7 upset that&#8217;s punctuated with Owen Nolan&#8217;s long-distance dagger.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2r3eHGIk88\" width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> Coming off the high of that win, the Sharks sputter out of the gate against the Dallas Stars in Round 2. They&#8217;re shut out in each of the first two games and lose the series in five.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 1/10. Maybe it didn&#8217;t end up being a Cinderella run, but that Blues upset was one of the highlights of franchise history.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2001</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> The Sharks record a franchise-best 95 points, and finish second in the Pacific. This version of the team was led by Nolan and a 21-year-old <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/patrick-marleau/170699\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"170699\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/patrick-marleau/170699\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"170699\">Patrick Marleau</a></a>, supported by a cast of &#8220;Wait, that guy played for the Sharks?&#8221; veterans like Gary Suter, Mike Ricci and Vincent Damphousse. Teemu Selanne arrives late in the season, and Evgeni Nabokov earns the Calder Trophy for his work in goal.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> In a Round 1 rematch with the Blues, the Sharks drop a six-game series that could have gone either way. The turning point comes in Game 5, in which the Sharks take a 2-1 lead into the third but end up dropping a 3-2 decision on overtime on Bryce Salvador&#8217;s winner.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 3/10. Expectations are slowly but surely increasing, and simply making an appearance in the post-season no longer feels like mission accomplished. Still, if you have to lose to someone, it was kind of nice to see it be the Blues. Those guys are stuck with a reputation for never winning anything in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2002</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> The Sharks record 99 points to lead their division for the first time. It&#8217;s a veteran group \u2013 Adam Graves even makes an appearance \u2013 and it leans heavily on its goaltending duo of Nabokov and rookie Miikka Kiprusoff. They make it out of the First Round, beating the then-Phoenix Coyotes in six games and setting up a Second Round meeting with the Colorado Avalanche.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> The Sharks lead the series three separate times, but can&#8217;t close. They hold a 3-2 series lead heading into Game 6 at home, but lose in overtime on a Peter Forsberg goal in a game marked by a <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup02/games/2002-05-13-col-sj.htm\" target=\"_blank\">third period earthquake</a>. Then they drop a 1-0 decision in the seventh game, with Selanne <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVmTknaX0Z8#t=21\" target=\"_blank\">missing an open net early</a> on that could have changed the course of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 5/10. The loss to the Avalanche may not have been an upset, but the way it played out left a mark.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2003</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> After what seemed like a breakout season, the Sharks unravel in 2002-03 and miss the playoffs. They <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Sharks-fire-Darryl-Sutter-Help-wanted-The-top-5-2748849.php\" target=\"_blank\">fire coach Darryl Sutter</a> in December, and GM Dean Lombardi follows a <a href=\"http://napavalleyregister.com/sports/sharks-fire-gm-lombardi-after-seven-seasons/article_7c75e337-1e83-51a3-bc86-dd9e511dea94.html\" target=\"_blank\">few months later</a>. Spoiler alert: Those two guys show up again later.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> The Sharks don&#8217;t even come close to the post-season, finishing 19 points back. They do wind up with two first round picks in the ridiculously stacked 2003 draft, but can only turn them into <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/milan-michalek/228966\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"228966\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/milan-michalek/228966\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"228966\">Milan Michalek</a></a> and <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/steve-bernier/229380\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229380\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/steve-bernier/229380\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229380\">Steve Bernier</a></a>. The two players taken right after the Sharks&#8217; picks: <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/ryan-suter/229371\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229371\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/ryan-suter/229371\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229371\">Ryan Suter</a></a> and <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/zach-parise/229381\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229381\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/zach-parise/229381\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229381\">Zach Parise</a></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 2/10. Disappointment? Definitely. Frustration? Sure. But this can&#8217;t really qualify as heartbreak.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2004</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> The Sharks roar back into the playoff picture with a 104-point season. They&#8217;re not exactly stacked \u2013 Nils Ekman is their second leading scorer \u2013 but they&#8217;re well-balanced and tough to score on. They beat the Blues and the Avalanche in the opening two rounds to advance to the Conference Final for the first time in franchise history. (That Avs series gets a little dicey \u2013 the Sharks take a 3-0 series lead, then lose back-to-back overtime games before winning game six \u2013 but otherwise it&#8217;s a fairly smooth ride.)</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> They end up facing the Flames, who are led by a couple of familiar faces: Sutter behind the bench and Kiprusoff in goal. The Sharks are the favorites, and a trip to the Cup final seems in sight. But they drop the first two games of the series at home, and end up losing in six.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 4/10. On the one hand, the franchise is headed in the right direction again. On the other, they let a golden chance at a Final appearance slip through their fingers. They probably can&#8217;t wait to get back out there. Sure hope the league doesn&#8217;t cancel the next season.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2006</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> Early in the year, they pull off the biggest trade in team history by acquiring <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/joe-thornton/170656\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"170656\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/joe-thornton/170656\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"170656\">Joe Thornton</a></a> from the <a class=\"sn-team-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/boston-bruins/\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"boston-bruins\" data-league=\"nhl\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/boston-bruins/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"boston-bruins\" data-league=\"nhl\">Boston Bruins</a></a>. He goes on to win the Art Ross and Hart Trophy, and somehow turns Jonathan Cheechoo into a 56-goal scorer. Nobody can believe the Bruins soured on Thornton just because he had a few bad playoff years and\u2026 wait, where&#8217;s that ominous music coming from?</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> After knocking off the Predators in the opening round, the Sharks blow a 2-0 series lead and drop their Second Round matchup with the Edmonton Oilers in six.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 5/10. In an upset-heavy Western Conference, the path to the Cup final was once again looking clear. The Sharks&#8217; reputation isn&#8217;t fully in bloom yet, but the seeds have been planted.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2007</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> Thornton and Marleau form a deadly one-two punch at centre, and a young blue-line features <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/christian-ehrhoff/172864\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"172864\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/christian-ehrhoff/172864\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"172864\">Christian Ehrhoff</a></a>, <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/matt-carle/230687\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"230687\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/matt-carle/230687\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"230687\">Matt Carle</a></a> and a 19-year-old <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/marc-edouard-vlasic/302865\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"302865\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/marc-edouard-vlasic/302865\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"302865\">Marc-Edouard Vlasic</a></a>. They post a franchise-best 107 points and roll over the Predators in the opening round for the second straight year. That sets up a heavyweight matchup with the 113-point Red Wings in Round 2.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> The Sharks take a 2-1 series lead and hold a one-goal lead in the final minute of Game 4, but once again they can&#8217;t close. The Wings get the tying goal from Robert Lang with 30 seconds left and the winner from Matthieu Schneider in overtime. They don&#8217;t look back, allowing only one Sharks goal while winning the next two games to end the series.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIpjhlh9As0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 6/10. The Red Wings were a great team, but the Sharks had them on the ropes and let them escape. This is becoming a pattern.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2008</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> Another franchise record for points \u2014 this time with 108 \u2014 and another First Round win, this time over Calgary. They need seven games for that one, though, so nerves are already frayed when they head to their Second Round matchup against the Stars.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> The Stars series is a disaster from the opener, as Dallas wins each of the first three games, including two in overtime. To their credit, the Sharks push back, winning the next two and forcing overtime in Game 6. It turns out to be the longest game in Sharks history, dragging into a fourth overtime period before Brenden Morrow ends the Sharks&#8217; season.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 7/10. The &#8220;playoff underachievers&#8221; reputation has been firmly affixed at this point. But hey, at least they didn&#8217;t fold up when they were down 3-0 in the series, even though everyone knows that teams never blow that lead in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2009</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> Welcome to the Todd McLellan era, as the Sharks <a href=\"http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/15982-San-Jose-Sharks-fire-head-coach-Ron-Wilson-after-secondround-exit.html\" target=\"_blank\">make Ron Wilson the fall guy</a> for all that playoff disappointment. McLellan leads them to their best regular season ever, a Presidents&#8217; Trophy-winning 117-point campaign.</p>\n<p>Thornton and Marleau have been joined by <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/joe-pavelski/329570\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"329570\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/joe-pavelski/329570\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"329570\">Joe Pavelski</a></a> and Devin Setoguchi by this point, and Rob Blake arrives as a free agent. The Sharks head into the playoffs as a massive favourite over the eight-seed Ducks. They&#8217;d better not lose in the second round again, am I right?</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> The Ducks walk into San Jose and take the first two games, and never look back. Thornton tries to rally the troops by fighting <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/ryan-getzlaf/229383\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229383\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/ryan-getzlaf/229383\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229383\">Ryan Getzlaf</a></a> off the opening draw in Game 6, but it doesn&#8217;t work \u2013 the Ducks win the game 4-1 and take the series.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8BMUaec1XkQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 9/10. The Sharks outshot the Ducks in every game, but managed only ten goals and were shutout twice. At this point, they&#8217;re the go-to &#8220;choker&#8221; punchline for NHL fans. And with Wilson gone, the blame has firmly shifted to Marleau and Thornton; Marleau will be <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Marleau-stripped-of-captaincy-by-the-Sharks?urn=nhl,183427\" target=\"_blank\">stripped of the captaincy over the summer</a>.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2010</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> After the previous year&#8217;s disaster, the Sharks posted another strong regular season that nobody cared about because by this point it was all about the playoffs. They posted the best record in the Western Conference, setting up another battle with an eight seed \u2013 this time, the Avalanche. Things got off to a rocky start, with the Avs taking a 2-1 series lead with a Game 3 overtime win in which the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjqM_GSdD04\" target=\"_blank\">Sharks score into their own net</a>. But San Jose fought back, winning the series in six and then knocking out the Red Wings in five to return to the Conference Final for the first time since 2004. Things were finally turning around!</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> They faced the Blackhawks, and were swept in four straight.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 5/10. After the debacle of 2009, this almost felt like a relief. The loss was disappointing, sure, but at least it was over quickly, and at least they won a few rounds first. So\u2026 progress?</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2011</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> Blake and Nabokov are gone, and Thornton is the new captain. Another 100+ point season, another division title, blah blah blah, get to the playoffs.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> After eliminating the Kings in six and the Wings in seven, the Sharks faced the Canucks in the Conference Final. For once, San Jose was the underdog \u2013 Vancouver had run away with the Presidents&#8217; Trophy \u2013 and they dropped the first two games before returning home to win Game 3. The turning point came in Game 4, which the Sharks dominated. But they take four minor penalties in less than three minutes midway through the second, and the Canucks convert those into three power-play goals to seal the win. The series would end back in Vancouver in Game 5, thanks to one of the strangest overtime goals in recent memory:</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"visibility: hidden;\" class=\"brightcove-iframe1941056427\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/brightcove-video-cloud/bc-iframe.php?vidid=959277630001&#038;ap=false&#038;dataplayer=HJLhXYvZ&#038;dataaccount=1704050871&#038;uniqueid=&#038;skinclass=vjs-sportsnet&#038;autostart=false&#038;cmsid=384&#038;adserverurlparam=Video&#038;section=sportsnet%3Afeed&#038;playrollads=true\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" seamless allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\"> var SN = window.SN || {}; if (!window.SN.BrightcoveMethods) { document.write('<script src=\"/wp-content/plugins/video-js/js/brightcove-methods.js\"><\\/script>')}; </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">SN.BrightcoveMethods.register($(\".brightcove-iframe1941056427\"));</script></p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 6/10. Sharks fans had to be getting just a little bit numb by this point. The stanchion goal was a nice touch, though.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2012</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> Early in the off-season, the Sharks sent Setoguchi to the <a class=\"sn-team-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/minnesota-wild/\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"minnesota-wild\" data-league=\"nhl\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/minnesota-wild/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"minnesota-wild\" data-league=\"nhl\">Minnesota Wild</a></a> for <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/brent-burns/229384\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229384\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/brent-burns/229384\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"229384\">Brent Burns</a></a>, a robbery of a deal that would pay off down the line. But the early impact was minimal; with 96 points, the Sharks posted their worst regular season since cratering back in 2003, and went into the First Round as underdogs against the Blues. Hey, maybe taking some of the pressure off would get them over the hump.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> Nope. After winning Game 1 in overtime, the Sharks dropped four straight.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 4/10. The Sharks should just mark the opening of the playoffs by replacing the national anthem with the first verse of <em>The Sound of Silence</em>.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2013</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> In the lockout-shortened season, the Sharks made the playoffs as a sixth seed and draw a tough matchup with the Canucks. But they won relatively easily, sweeping the series in four straight to signal that, finally, a change had come to\u2014 oh wait, here come the Kings.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> By this point, Lombardi and Sutter are running the show in L.A. The two rivals go toe-to-toe in a classic seven-game series, with the home team winning each of the first six to set up a deciding Game 7 showdown in Los Angeles. A pair of <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/justin-williams/171290\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"171290\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/justin-williams/171290\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"171290\">Justin Williams</a></a> goals gave the defending champs a 2-0 lead in the second, but the Sharks got one back early in the third. That set up a dramatic finish, one in which Joe Pavelski finds himself with an open net with five minutes left.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1Dj3j38gAY\" width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 6/10. At least that&#8217;s the worst thing that could ever happen to us against the Kings, said Sharks fans, not even pretending to believe it.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2014</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> Do we have to? This just seems cruel.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> You know how this one goes. A 111-point season, a First Round rematch with the Kings, two blowout wins at home, and an overtime road win to take a 3-0 series lead.</p>\n<p>And then, the collapse.</p>\n<p>Over the final four games of the series, the Sharks weren&#8217;t just swept \u2014 they were decimated, outscored by a total of 18-5 and losing each game by three or more.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> 10/10. This is it. Rock bottom. The nadir of sports fandom. This is what it&#8217;s like to see all your worst fears played out in front of the world, for a full week, and be unable to look away even though you know exactly how it&#8217;s going to end. Nothing can hurt you anymore after this, because you&#8217;re already dead inside.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>2015</strong><br />\n<strong>The team:</strong> GM Doug Wilson promises to strip the team down and start over, but doesn&#8217;t. Thornton is stripped of the captaincy, then tells Wilson to <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/joe-thornton-doug-wilson-shut-mouth-captaincy-san-jose-sharks-season-ticket-holders/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;stop lying&#8221; and &#8220;shut his mouth.&#8221;</a> The team misses the playoffs, and McLellan is fired and banished to spend the rest of his days wasting away in a penal colony.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2161805 aligncenter\" src=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/McLellan_Chiarelli.jpg\" alt=\"Todd McLellan, left, and Peter Chiarelli, President of Hockey Operations and General Manager of the Edmonton Oilers, hold up a jersey during a press conference after the Oilers announced McLellan as their new head coach in Edmonton, Alta., on Tuesday May 19, 2015.

Fun fact: A shark&#8217;s heart is a <a href=\"https://sharks101.wordpress.com/circulatory-and-respiratory-system/\" target=\"_blank\">two-chambered S-shaped tube</a> located near its head.

With Wilson&#8217;s promised rebuild never materializing, we end up getting what could be the last shot for the Marleau/Thornton-era version of the Sharks. They put up a respectable 98 points, good for third in the Pacific, and then raise eyebrows around the hockey world by stomping the Kings in the opening round.</p>\n<p>That leaves them well-rested and with home-ice advantage against the wildcard Predators in a series that everyone agrees they should win. The home team wins each of the first six games, sending it back to San Jose for a decisive Game 7.</p>\n<p><strong>The disappointment:</strong> To be determined.</p>\n<p><strong>Heartbreak rating:</strong> Good luck and Godspeed, Sharks fans. After 15 seasons of misery, you&#8217;ve earned some happiness. The rest of will be rooting for you. We&#8217;ll just, uh, be doing it from as far away as possible. You know, just in case something terrible happens.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Hockey</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NHL</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>ANH</team>\n\t\t\t<team>BOS</team>\n\t\t\t<team>CGY</team>\n\t\t\t<team>DET</team>\n\t\t\t<team>LA</team>\n\t\t\t<team>MIN</team>\n\t\t\t<team>NSH</team>\n\t\t\t<team>SJ</team>\n\t\t\t<team>STL</team>\n\t\t\t<team>TOR</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"343\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lindy_ruff.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lindy_ruff.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Dallas Stars face a big off-season dilemma</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/dallas-stars-off-season-free-agents-kari-lehtonen-antti-niemi-goaltending-jason-demers-kris-russell-alex-gologoski/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/dallas-stars-off-season-free-agents-kari-lehtonen-antti-niemi-goaltending-jason-demers-kris-russell-alex-gologoski//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:52:26 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:34:14 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Luke Fox</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2820479&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>After a Game 7 disaster that exposed the Dallas Stars&#8217;

They&#8217;d been sharing the pain and glory all season. That was Nill&#8217;s unconventional plan from the outset, and it <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/dallas-stars-antti-niemi-kari-lehtonen-tandem-first-place-back-to-back-travel-jim-nill/\" target=\"_blank\">worked like a charm</a> over 82 games.</p>\n<p>It worked because the 32-year-old Finns didn&#8217;t bicker, but mostly it worked because the Stars&#8217; league-best offence was a 265-goal juggernaut that lit the lamp 17 more times than the next most lethal team. Coach Lindy Ruff&#8217;s guidance of a top-four power play and top-10 penalty-killing scheme helped, too.</p>\n<p>Neither Lehtonen nor Niemi \u2014 whom the <a class=\"sn-team-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/san-jose-sharks/\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"san-jose-sharks\" data-league=\"nhl\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/san-jose-sharks/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"san-jose-sharks\" data-league=\"nhl\">San Jose Sharks</a></a> didn&#8217;t even try to keep in teal \u2014 mustered a save percentage above .899 in these playoffs, and Ruff&#8217;s biggest decision often became, &#8220;Do I yank him now or after he lets in the next one?&#8221;</p>\n<p>So, how does Nill mop up the blood spatter in the blue paint?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll take great luck and/or convincing ownership to spend more money. A buyout is an easy but expensive and embarrassing way out. Maybe 1A or 1B can be traded in a salary-dump deal if packaged with an attractive forward prospect (say, an impeding RFA like <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/valeri-nichushkin/741413\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"741413\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/valeri-nichushkin/741413\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"741413\">Valeri Nichushkin</a></a> or <a class=\"sn-player-post-link\" href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/brett-ritchie/607592\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"607592\"><a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/brett-ritchie/607592\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"607592\">Brett Ritchie</a></a>).

U.S. television networks\u2019 Saturday mornings were still the domain of animated kids\u2019 series, and the turnover rate was high. What if a cartoon featured the three biggest names in pro sports? Thus was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xXiShTDcr1I?t=11\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pro Stars</em> born</a>, a series that featured Michael Jordan, Bo Jackson and Wayne Gretzky. </p>\n<p>The format was not a typical one: Every episode opened with live-action sequences featuring the principals displaying their greatness in game action and then answering questions from kids about the challenges of growing up and playing sports.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, the animated characters arrived on the scene: a taller, more lithe version of MJ, a Hulk-ified Bo and a Spicoli-ish 99. </p>\n<p>\u201cWayne was the goofball,\u201d says Townsend Coleman, the actor who voiced Gretzky. \u201cHe was the one making the one-liners. Gretzky rode in the back seat of the Pro Stars\u2019 rocket car, driven by Jordan. For whatever reason, he was always hungry\u2014it\u2019s not explained in the show. He provided the comic relief for the other two hard-charging, go-get-\u2019em guys.\u201d</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/117RK2ebjak?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Coleman never met Gretzky, but he was a fan of the game, going to see the Barons play when he was growing up in Cleveland. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to play hockey with my friends, but my mother pushed me to be the figure-skating partner of my sister,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I finally got my way and played with my friends, she refused to buy me hockey skates, so I had to play in figure skates. And the one goal I scored that season, I skated the length of the ice and put it in the net\u2014my own net.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Pro Stars</em> wasn\u2019t much more successful\u2014it was cancelled after 13 episodes. Still, Coleman, who also voiced Michelangelo in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, mourns the brevity of its run. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe show had a good heart\u2014a great heart. \u2018Stars are here to help kids\u2019\u2014I liked that, as corny as that sounds. I liked that idea of helping kids through tough times in their lives.\u201d</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-bGB-Q7zG2w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>This article appears in the June issue of Sportsnet magazine.</em></p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Hockey</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NHL</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/power_will.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/power_will.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Expect podium for Penske at Grand Prix of Indianapolis</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/auto-racing/expect-podium-penske-grand-prix-indianapolis/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/auto-racing/expect-podium-penske-grand-prix-indianapolis//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:47:26 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:47:26 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Todd Lewis</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-blog-entry&#038;p=2821341&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>What should we expect at the third annual Grand Prix of Indianapolis? Based on previous races and early-season results, look for first lap carnage and Penske cars on the podium.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>What should we expect as IndyCar opens its May schedule this weekend with the third annual Grand Prix of Indianapolis? Based on what we\u2019ve seen in previous races on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and events so far this season: first lap carnage and Penske cars on the podium.</p>\n<p>After a huge crash from a standing start mishap in Year 1, IndyCar switched to a rolling start in Year 2. Another pile up occurred in Corner 1 as the track funnels down from four lanes wide into a much narrower racing line. During the race, it\u2019s the best overtaking zone on the fast and flowing 14-turn track. The key is getting through it the first time. There are several part-time runners for this event and 25 cars will be heading for the same piece of real estate.</p>\n<p>Penske driver Will Power started on pole and won the race last year. After missing out on the season opener in St. Petersburg, Power has finished no worse than seventh in three races and has climbed all the way up the championship standings to seventh spot. He\u2019s doing what is necessary to climb back into the title fight and snapping a year-long winless skid will go a long way to making a serious challenge.</p>\n<p>Teammate Simon Pagenaud is doing his best to run away from the rest of the field. After back-to-back runner-up results, Pagenaud has claimed victory in the last two events and was the winner of this race in 2014. If that wasn\u2019t enough to worry the competition, Pagenaud loves this track saying: \u201cIt really suits my driving style. In fact, this track probably suits my style the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>The other two Penske drivers, Helio Castroneves and Juan Pablo Montoya, have also scored podium finishes at the Grand Prix of Indianapolis.</p>\n<p>Another driver to watch for this weekend is Scott Dixon. The Ganassi driver is the defending series champion and sits second this year. Graham Rahal, who gave Pagenaud all he could handle in the fight for the win at the last race, was runner-up at this race a year ago after fighting his way to the front from a 17th place starting spot.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s some extra Canadian content for the next couple of races as well. James Hinchcliffe returns to compete at Indy for the first time since his crash a year ago.  Hinchcliffe has also posted top-10 results in the last two events, giving the Schmidt Peterson team some good karma heading into May.</p>\n<p>Coming back to the series for the two Indianapolis races is Lachenaie, Que., native Alex Tagliani. Though he\u2019s still racing in a variety of disciplines, including the Indy 500 the last few years, Tagliani hasn\u2019t driven an IndyCar road course in nearly three years. A tall order to overcome, yes, but Tagliani is one of the best at sorting out the set up on racecars. He\u2019ll get the most out of what the equipment gives him.  </p>\n<p>There was skepticism about the viability of this race leading up to the first event. It has proven to be a successful venture and a great way to kick off the month of May.  No driver has been able to sweep both the road course race and the Indy 500 yet, but all feel that a good run this weekend will help build momentum for the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 in two weeks time.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Auto Racing</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>IndyCar</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/biyombo_bismack.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/biyombo_bismack.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Raptors&#8217; Biyombo takes frustration out on Heat in Game 5</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/raptors-biyombo-takes-frustration-heat-game-5/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/raptors-biyombo-takes-frustration-heat-game-5//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 02:07:49 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 02:10:31 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Arden Zwelling</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2820273&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>After a frustrating night in Game 4, Bismack Biyombo was a dominant force in the paint all night for the Toronto Raptors in their Game 5 win against the Miami Heat. </p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>TORONTO \u2014 On Monday night in Miami, as the Raptors&#8217; Game 4 loss to the Heat was winding down, Bismack Biyombo sat nailed to the bench, watching a small Miami lineup attack the paint with great success against an equally small Toronto rotation. He was fuming with frustration.</p>\n<p>His head coach, Dwane Casey, was concerned about a lack of offence after Kyle Lowry fouled out of the game, and insisted on matching Miami\u2019s small lineup. So, Biyombo watched the last two minutes of regulation, as Heat star Dwyane Wade tied the game with seconds left on a layup from two feet out, cutting right into the heart of Biyombo\u2019s normal station.</p>\n<p>And the Raptors centre watched the first four minutes of overtime, too, as Patrick Patterson \u2014 playing in Biyombo\u2019s place \u2014 tipped a contested rebound into his own basket, and then Joe Johnson found room to sink a jumper in the paint, opening a four-point lead the Heat would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>On the replay of Johnson\u2019s shot you can see Biyombo sitting on the bench in the background, elbows on his knees, slumping his head forward as another basket was made that he thought he could have prevented.</p>\n<p>Reminded of this about 45 minutes after Wednesday night\u2019s Game 5\u00a0victory, while he stood all alone in an empty, well-heated Raptors locker room, wearing a trim grey suit with a white shirt and black tie, Biyombo wiped the sweat from his forehead and admitted that Game 4\u00a0moment was, in a word, frustrating.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was. It was. Honestly speaking, man, it really was,&#8221; Biyombo said, repeatedly. &#8220;But at the same time this is a learning process for us, for the coaches, for everybody. We all have to learn from this and get better from it as we move forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And move forward we do, to that Wednesday night win, when Biyombo was on the floor for almost the entire final 10 minutes as the Heat went with an uber small lineup yet again and attempted a comeback. Biyombo drew two fouls down that stretch and kept the Heat from earning easy baskets or fouls of their own under the Raptors rim, forcing Miami to take contested jump shots from well outside the paint.</p>\n<p>He finished the night having played nearly 38 minutes, by far the most he\u2019s seen in any game of these playoffs. And although his stat line won\u2019t jump off the page at you \u2014 he finished with 10 points, six rebounds and four blocked shots \u2014 his mere presence under both baskets and on screens was absolutely crucial to the Raptors&#8217; 99-91 victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought he was solid from a physicality standpoint; setting solid screens. He set the tone that way,&#8221; Casey said. &#8220;He did an excellent job in the paint. Joe Johnson\u2019s a handful and when Dwyane Wade gets going he\u2019s a handful, too. I thought Bismack\u2019s presence at the pick-and-roll was huge for us. That was very important.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Like Biyombo said, it appears the learning process took place. While Casey had plenty of reason to experiment with matching the Heat\u2019s small lineup of wings and guards during Game 4 \u2014 especially with Lowry out of the game \u2014 it was clear from Game 5 that the Raptors best counter to that Heat rotation is one that includes Biyombo\u2019s big body protecting the rim.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Last game, when they went small and we went small, they were stronger than us. Most of the points that they scored were in the paint,&#8221; Biyombo says. &#8220;And tonight most of the shots that they were trying to take were jump shots. Which is great for us. They tried to stay away from the paint. We stayed big so we forced them to play our way instead of us trying to play their way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can guard smalls. I can get out there and still be a defensive presence in the paint,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;They\u2019ll have to shoot a lot of jump shots. We can\u2019t let them just lay the ball in. Because, man, everybody was trying to dunk the ball in the last game when they went small. We know we have bigs that can guard smalls. It\u2019s just about us playing our game.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course, Biyombo\u2019s been thinking about this for days, since those late moments of Game 4 when he sat stewing on the bench. He never brought it up to Casey between then and now. And Casey never brought it up to him. As Game 5 developed, leaving Biyombo on the floor was simply the obvious choice.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn\u2019t talk to nobody about it. As a player, you have to accept decisions and let the coach do his job. The coach is the coach for a reason. And you have to respect that. I\u2019m not going to tell him how to do things,&#8221; Biyombo says. &#8220;You find other ways to contribute. You watch film, you talk to your teammates, you support them. If you just focus on the negative, the more you give it attention, the more it grows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now, we don\u2019t have time for any negatives,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;As soon as that game\u2019s over, it\u2019s a quick turnaround. And coming into the next one you can\u2019t have those thoughts. You have to forget all bout that and just focus on going out there and getting a win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And, simply put, the Raptors don\u2019t get that win Wednesday night without Biyombo. He\u2019s easily the most dominant paint presence currently playing in this series. As long as Hassan Whiteside remains sidelined, and Miami\u2019s options at centre are the physically inferior Amar\u2019e Stoudemire and Udonis Haslem, Biyombo should be able to operate with relative impunity on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s what he did for most of Wednesday night, bullying the Heat under both baskets and, at one point in the second quarter, turning the game into his own personal highlight reel &#8212; and a satisfying moment of revenge.</p>\n<p>It started with five minutes left, when Biyombo rebounded a missed DeMar DeRozan jump shot and flushed it over a pair of Heat defenders with two hands. He jogged back up the court to his own end and defended a Heat screen-and-roll perfectly, helping guard his man at first before retreating quickly and meeting Wade at the rim as the veteran guard drove in for a dunk.</p>\n<p>Biyombo swatted the ball away and sent Wade spilling to the floor in the process, pausing for a moment to stand over the future Hall of Famer and wag his finger as the Raptors ran back up the court. Seconds later, there was Biyombo flying into the Miami paint, taking a feed from Lowry, and throwing down his strongest dunk of the night to push the Raptors out to a 19-point lead.</p>\n<p>Biyombo ate it up as he paced back up the court, waving his arms in the air as the Air Canada Centre erupted around him. But it was the moment standing over Wade, glaring down at the fallen Heat star, that felt best.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I was watching the last game from the bench and he got that last bucket \u2014 I just didn\u2019t feel right,&#8221; Biyombo says. &#8220;So, that was just me letting him know that, down the stretch, whenever he comes down into the paint, I\u2019m going to be there. It ain\u2019t going to be the same.&#8221;</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Basketball</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NBA</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>MIA</team>\n\t\t\t<team>TOR</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cueto_johnny.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cueto_johnny.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Cueto strong, Greinke struggles again as Giants top Diamondbacks</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/cueto-strong-greinke-struggles-giants-top-diamondbacks/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/cueto-strong-greinke-struggles-giants-top-diamondbacks//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:15:20 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 01:20:44 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2822161&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Johnny Cueto pitched seven strong innings for San Francisco, Zack Greinke had another rough outing at home for Arizona and the Giants opened a four-game series with a 4-2 victory over the Diamondbacks on Thursday night.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>PHOENIX &#8212; Johnny Cueto pitched seven strong innings for San Francisco, Zack Greinke had another rough outing at home for Arizona and the Giants opened a four-game series with a 4-2 victory over the Diamondbacks on Thursday night.</p>\n<p>    Joe Panik hit a two-run homer off Greinke, who fell to 1-3 in five home starts. Chris Owings had an RBI triple for Arizona.</p>\n<p>    Cueto (5-1) allowed two runs and eight hits, striking out nine and walking two in a matchup of two of the highest-priced free agent pitchers last off-season. Cueto signed a six-year, $130 million contract, which was dwarfed by Greinke&#8217;s six-year, $206.5 million deal.</p>\n<p>    Greinke (3-3) gave up four runs and eight hits in six innings, raising his ERA to 5.26 in eight starts. Greinke led the majors with a 1.66 ERA last season.</p>\n<p>    Arizona mounted a serious threat in the ninth against closer Santiago Casilla when a pinch-hit double by Phil Gosselin and single by Jean Segura put runners at first and third with one out. Casilla struck out Brandon Drury, but walked Paul Goldschmidt to load the bases. Left-hander Javier Lopez relieved Casilla and got left-handed batting Jake Lamb to ground out, earning his first save since Sept. 19, 2013.</p>\n<p>    The Diamondbacks fell to 5-13 at home.</p>\n<p>    Greinke has allowed 24 runs in five home starts. Last season, he gave up 19 runs in 17 starts at home for the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>\n<p>    Greinke blanked the Giants on one hit through three innings before consecutive singles by Matt Duffy, Buster Posey and Brandon Belt tied it at 1. A fielder&#8217;s choice groundout by Hunter Pence gave San Francisco a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>    Denard Span singled to start the fifth. Then, Panik hit Greinke&#8217;s first pitch into the right-field seats to make it 4-1.</p>\n<p>    Arizona scored one in the first on Drury&#8217;s RBI single and another in the sixth when Owings tripled into the right-field gap.</p>\n<p>    Goldschmidt struck out three times and hit into a double play.</p>\n<p>    Cueto has pitched at least seven innings in all but one of his starts this season.</p>\n<p>    RJ WAY</p>\n<p>    The Diamondbacks and city of Phoenix held a ceremony earlier in the day renaming the street in front of Chase Field Randy Johnson Way. The Hall of Famer and five-time Cy Young winner also threw out the ceremonial first pitch.</p>\n<p>    GIANTS MOVE</p>\n<p>    Before the game, San Francisco recalled RHP Clayton Blackburn from Triple-A Sacramento and optioned OF Jarrett Parker to Sacramento.

It was the left-hander&#8217;s fifth straight start with double-digit strikeouts, a club record. It was also his second shutout this month. He beat San Diego 1-0 on May 1.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Walking guys is how you get in trouble. I&#8217;d rather string hits together and make them swing the bats to beat me. That&#8217;s always my mentality,&#34; Kershaw said. &#34;Fortunately, I feel like my mechanics have felt pretty solid the whole season and I&#8217;m able to repeat pitches pretty consistently.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Kershaw dominated in a matchup featuring pitchers with a combined four Cy Young Awards between them, with three belonging to the Dodgers ace. He improved to 7-0 with 74 strikeouts in 10 regular season starts against the Mets.</p>\n<p>    &#34;He never gives in,&#34; Mets manager Terry Collins said. &#34;He doesn&#8217;t have to stay in the zone to get you out. He&#8217;s so dominant. He pitches in well to both sides of the plate. He makes you speed the bat up. His off-speed stuff is tremendous.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The Dodgers jumped on Bartolo Colon (3-2) with four runs in the first inning. Their first run came on Justin Turner&#8217;s RBI single before Grandal homered off a 2-0 pitch into the right-field pavilion, making it 4-0.</p>\n<p>    Chase Utley added a two-out homer in the second for a 5-0 lead.</p>\n<p>    &#34;They were aggressive early in the game. First two guys got base hits on the first swing,&#34; Mets catcher Kevin Plawecki said. &#34;They were aggressive and took advantage of the balls up in the zone.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The Dodgers came in averaging 2.69 runs at home after averaging 4.2 last year, but they delivered early support for Kershaw, who improved to 81-0 when given four or more runs of support while in the game. Los Angeles is 91-6 in those contests.</p>\n<p>    &#34;You want to help your pitcher out, especially early in the game,&#34; said Grandal, who homered for the second straight game.</p>\n<p>    The Mets&#8217; fourth shutout loss of the season dropped them into a first-place tie with Washington atop the NL East.</p>\n<p>    Colon gave up a season-high five runs and seven hits in five innings, equaling his shortest outing of the season. He struck out three and walked none in losing for the first time since April 9. In his last start, the 42-year-old became the oldest pitcher to homer in the major leagues with a stunning shot in San Diego last week.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I was throwing strikes and they were jumping on my first pitches,&#34; Colon said through a translator.</p>\n<p>    TRAINER&#8217;S ROOM</p>\n<p>    Mets: Placed INF Wilmer Flores on 15-day DL retroactive to Wednesday with a strained left hamstring.</p>\n<p>    Dodgers: RHP Mike Bolinger made his second straight rehab start with Triple-A Oklahoma City as he works his way back from a left oblique strain.</p>\n<p>    HITTING COLON</p>\n<p>    Utley tied a season high with three hits, including a pair of singles, and scored two runs. He is 10 for 20 with two doubles and a homer with three RBI during his career against Colon. Utley ranks second among active players in both hits (188) and homers (36) against the Mets.</p>\n<p>    UP NEXT</p>\n<p>    Mets: RH Matt Harvey (3-4, 4.50) pitches the opener of a three-game series at Colorado, where he is 2-0 with a 0.39 ERA in three career starts. He struck out a season-high 10 in last his last start May 8 at San Diego.</p>\n<p>    Dodgers: RH Ross Stripling (0-2, 3.82) makes his first career start against St. Louis in the series opener.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Baseball</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>MLB</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>LAD</team>\n\t\t\t<team>NYM</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alexander-steen-alex-pietrangelo.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alexander-steen-alex-pietrangelo.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Blues on track for first final in nearly 50 years</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/blues-track-first-final-nearly-50-years/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/blues-track-first-final-nearly-50-years//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:24:05 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:24:05 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Canadian Press</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2822111&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The St. Louis Blues haven&#8217;t been to the Stanley Cup final in almost 50 years, but they&#8217;ll get there this year in a meeting with the reigning Eastern Conference champions.

Here are The Canadian Press picks for the NHL conference finals:</p>\n<p>    <strong>Pittsburgh Penguins vs. Tampa Bay Lightning</strong></p>\n<p>    <strong>Pick:</strong> Lightning in seven.</p>\n<p>    There&#8217;s very little separating the two Eastern finalists, and that should ensure a close conference final.</p>\n<p>    Pittsburgh has followed a dominant finish to the regular season (14 wins in 16 games) with a pretty thorough takedown of both the New York Rangers and Washington Capitals.</p>\n<p>    The Penguins depth has been most encouraging.</p>\n<p>    The team&#8217;s best line throughout the playoffs has not included either Evgeni Malkin or Sidney Crosby. Instead, it&#8217;s been the trio of Phil Kessel, Nick Bonino and Carl Hagelin.</p>\n<p>    Kessel has been especially dangerous, leading the team with 12 points through the first two rounds, including a two-goal, three-point performance in the Game 6 clincher against Washington.</p>\n<p>    Pittsburgh&#8217;s defence is also back at full-strength with Olli Maatta returning from a suspected concussion and Kris Letang enjoying an impressive post-season.</p>\n<p>    Rookie Matt Murray, meanwhile, has been terrific in goal, though there are lingering questions in the Penguins crease with longtime No. 1 Marc-Andre Fleury available to play.</p>\n<p>    Tampa has rushed to another Eastern Conference final despite playing without captain Steven Stamkos and defenceman Anton Stralman.</p>\n<p>    Like the Penguins, the Lightning have quality depth, though they&#8217;ve been led mostly this post-season by the exciting combination of Nikita Kucherov and Tyler Johnson. An impending restricted free agent, Kucherov has been electric with nine goals in 10 games, while Johnson has risen after a subpar regular season with 13 points.</p>\n<p>    Additionally fueling the Lightning&#8217;s run is polarizing 21-year-old winger Jonathan Drouin, mesmerizing at times (nine points) following a turbulent regular season which included a much-publicized team suspension and trade request.</p>\n<p>    Tampa is backed by perhaps the best goaltender in the NHL this season, Ben Bishop, who has two shutouts already this spring. The club may also get both Stamkos and Stralman back at some point, the Swedish defenceman the likelier of the two.</p>\n<p>    Even without them there&#8217;s enough here in terms of speed and skill for the Lightning to match up with and ultimately defeat the favoured Penguins.</p>\n<p>    The difference may just be in goal. While Murray has shined in his first NHL post-season, Fleury lingers in the background, despite having not played since the end of March. An uncomfortable situation looms.</p>\n<p>    Bishop is Bishop, meanwhile, sturdy and reliable in Tampa&#8217;s net.</p>\n<p>    His edge is enough to guide the Lightning to a second straight Stanley Cup final.</p>\n<p>    <strong>St. Louis Blues vs. San Jose Sharks</strong></p>\n<p>   <strong> Pick:</strong> Blues in seven.</p>\n<p>    St. Louis has been falling short in the playoffs for years, but not this spring. The Blues have already outlasted the defending champion Chicago Blackhawks and Western Conference top seed Dallas Stars, both in gruelling seven-game series.</p>\n<p>    This will be the year the Blues reach the Stanley Cup final for the first time since 1970.</p>\n<p>    St. Louis is better all around than the Sharks, who beat the Nashville Predators 5-0 in Game 7 on Thursday night.</p>\n<p>    The Blues, for one, have two legitimate game-changers up front in Russian star Vladimir Tarasenko (seven goals, 13 points) and 20-year-old Robby Fabbri (13 points). Beyond those two emerging talents is plenty of quality, playoff-tested depth, from captain David Backes to Alex Steen to Paul Stastny to veteran Troy Brouwer, who has five goals and 10 points thus far.</p>\n<p>    That depth is matched by a sturdy back-end, fronted by Alex Pietrangelo, who&#8217;s doing it all for St. Louis while averaging 30 minutes a night.</p>\n<p>    The big question for the Blues is goaltender Brian Elliott. He&#8217;s been excellent since he took over for an injured Jake Allen late in the regular season, but old playoff demons remain and surfaced again when he was pulled quickly in Game 6 against Dallas.</p>\n<p>    Elliott rebounded with a near-perfect performance in Game 7. His conference final adversary, Martin Jones, has had his struggles.</p>\n<p>    The Sharks look dangerous (they won two of three against the Blues in the regular season) given their potent power-play, numerous weapons up front, not to mention on defence where wacky but incredibly productive Brent Burns continues to thrive (playoff-leading 15 points).</p>\n<p>    But the Blues are the pick for a rare Stanley Cup final appearance that will help erase past failures.</p>\n<p>   <strong> Playoff picks record:</strong> 10-2</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Hockey</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NHL</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ShieldsJames.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ShieldsJames.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Shields strikes out nine to help Padres shut out Brewers</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/shields-strikes-nine-help-padres-shut-brewers/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/shields-strikes-nine-help-padres-shut-brewers//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 23:30:00 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:45:08 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2821963&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>James Shields had a season-high nine strikeouts in seven innings to lead the San Diego Padres to a 3-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday night.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>MILWAUKEE &#8212; <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/james-shields/200694\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"200694\">James Shields</a> finally figured things out in the bullpen Thursday night.</p>\n<p>    The right-hander struck out a season-high nine over seven innings, and the <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/teams/san-diego-padres/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"san-diego-padres\" data-league=\"mlb\">San Diego Padres</a> beat the Milwaukee Brewers 3-0.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I felt really good,&#34; Shields said. &#34;I think I cleaned up my delivery a little bit in the bullpen session, and I was more consistent.&#34;</p>\n<p>    San Diego won its third straight game for the first time this season. Shields (2-5) allowed seven hits and one walk, Brandon Maurer pitched the eighth and Ryan Buchter had the ninth for his first major league save.</p>\n<p>    &#34;He&#8217;s been fighting all year, and it really came together tonight for him,&#34; San Diego manager Andy Green said of Shields. &#34;He battled all day, gave us seven strong.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Melvin Upton Jr. homered for the fourth time and had three hits, two RBIs and two runs for the Padres one day after San Diego swept a doubleheader at the Chicago Cubs.</p>\n<p>    Milwaukee&#8217;s Jimmy Nelson (4-3) pitched a season-high eight innings and gave up two earned runs on five hits but lost for the second time in his last seven starts.</p>\n<p>    Ryan Braun extended his hitting streak to 12 games for the Brewers, who are 3-6 in their last nine games.</p>\n<p>    Milwaukee put the leadoff batter on in four of the first six innings, but Shields avoided damage each time in his first start against the Brewers in his 11-year career.</p>\n<p>    In the first, Shields allowed a leadoff double to Domingo Santana and then a single to Scooter Gennett. Gennett was thrown out in a run down between first and second, though, and then Shields got Braun and Jonathan Lucroy to ground out.</p>\n<p>    Jonathan Villar singled to lead off the sixth for Milwaukee. Another single by Gennett put runners on first and third with one out, but Braun hit into a double play.</p>\n<p>    &#34;We had the right guy up there, for sure,&#34; Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said.</p>\n<p>    San Diego was able to capitalize when its leadoff batters reached, beginning in the fourth when Wil Myers singled. He stole second and scored on a two-out single by Upton to centre field.</p>\n<p>    The Padres took a 2-0 lead in the seventh. Upton led off with a double, advanced to third on a fly out to right field by Christian Bethancourt and scored on a sacrifice fly to left from Alexei Ramirez.</p>\n<p>    Upton&#8217;s solo blast came in the ninth off reliever Tyler Thornburg, giving him two homers in three days.</p>\n<p>    NORRIS EXITS</p>\n<p>    San Diego C Derek Norris was replaced by Bethancourt in the second inning because of a bruised left hand after he was drilled by a pitch. X-rays were negative, according to Green.</p>\n<p>    ARMING UP</p>\n<p>    After the game, the Brewers announced they acquired RHP Jhan Marinez from Tampa Bay for cash and designated LHP Michael Kirkman for assignment.</p>\n<p>    FACED THEM ALL</p>\n<p>    Shields has now faced all 30 teams and has pitched in every current stadium but Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati.</p>\n<p>    UPDATE ON WEEKS</p>\n<p>    Green told reporters before the game that 2B Jemile Weeks&#8217; right hamstring strain will keep him out at least two to three weeks.</p>\n<p>    &#34;We&#8217;re going to reevaluate at the end of that and see what kind of progress he&#8217;s made,&#34; Green said. &#34;He played tremendous defence. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, Gold Glove-caliber defence.

Manager Pete Mackanin called the trip &#34;pretty successful.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Odubel Herrera matched his career high with four hits, including a triple off Jason Grilli (1-2) leading off the 10th.</p>\n<p>    Grilli hit Andres Blanco with a pitch, then struck out Maikel Franco. Darin Ruf pinch hit for Ryan Howard and struck out on three pitches against Krol, who loaded the bases with a four-pitch walk to Freddy Galvis.</p>\n<p>    After watching the Galvis at-bat, Rupp said he was looking for &#34;a pitch I can drive.&#34;</p>\n<p>    &#34;To come up and pick up your teammates &#8230; it was kind of a big game for us,&#34; Rupp said. &#34;To get that hit was pretty exciting.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Andrew Bailey (2-0) got the final out of the ninth, and Jeanmar Gomez pitched the 10th for his major league-leading 13th save in 14 tries.</p>\n<p>    Despite rallying from a 4-0 deficit with four runs in the seventh, Atlanta dropped to a big league-worst 8-25, including 2-17 at home.</p>\n<p>    Freddy Galvis hit a two-run homer for the Phillies, who won two of three for their first series win at Turner Field since Sept. 1-3, 2014.</p>\n<p>    After Wednesday night&#8217;s 5-1 win over the Phillies, the Braves failed in their chance for their first home series win.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Comebacks are great, but if you don&#8217;t win the game it doesn&#8217;t much matter,&#34; said Braves catcher A.J. Pierzynski, who played in his 2,000th game.</p>\n<p>    Vince Velasquez allowed only two hits through six scoreless innings before tiring in the seventh. Singles by Freddie Freeman and Pierzynski and a walk to Kelly Johnson loaded the bases with no outs. Gordon Beckham, who hit into double plays in each of his first two at-bats, hit a first-pitch, three-run double. Pinch-hitter Jeff Francoeur followed with a tying single off David Hernandez.</p>\n<p>    Rookie Aaron Blair allowed four runs &#8212; three earned &#8212; and six hits in 3 2/3 innings, the shortest of his four starts with Atlanta.</p>\n<p>    EXTRA FUN</p>\n<p>    The Phillies are 4-0 in extra-inning games. The Braves are 2-5. The Phillies&#8217; four wins in extra innings lead the National League.</p>\n<p>    YOUNG HURLERS</p>\n<p>    Velasquez and Blair are 23-year-old right-handers on the two youngest rotations in the majors.</p>\n<p>    After trading Jhoulys Chacin to the Angels on Wednesday and recalling Williams Perez from Triple-A Gwinnett, the Braves have the youngest rotation with an average age of 24 years, 182 days. The Phillies are the second-youngest at 25 years, 221 days, according to the Braves.</p>\n<p>    SCORING CHANGE</p>\n<p>    An eighth-inning error charged to Herrera in centre field on Beckham&#8217;s single in Wednesday night&#8217;s game was changed to a double for Beckham on Thursday. Beckham never stopped running as he rounded first. The change in scoring made the run allowed by Phillies left-hander Elvis Araujo earned instead of unearned.</p>\n<p>    TRAINER&#8217;S ROOM</p>\n<p>    Phillies: OF Cody Asche (right oblique strain) was 0 for 2 with two walks in an extended spring training game on Thursday.

Schoop&#8217;s triple was the only extra-base hit in a seventh inning that included five singles.</p>\n<p>    Baltimore trailed 5-0 in the sixth. Detroit starter Mike Pelfrey allowed two runs in 5 1/3 innings, but the collapse of the Detroit bullpen left the right-hander winless in 15 starts since Aug. 12.</p>\n<p>    Alex Wilson gave up three runs in the seventh and Justin Wilson (0-1) yielded the last two.</p>\n<p>    After Adam Jones, Chris Davis and Pedro Alvarez hit RBI singles, Schoop cleared the bases with a liner into the right-field corner.</p>\n<p>    Vance Worley (2-0) worked two innings, and Zach Britton got three outs for his ninth save in nine chances.</p>\n<p>    Jarod Saltalamacchi homered and Victor Martinez had three hits and two RBIs for the Tigers. Martinez is 10 for 13 in his last three games.</p>\n<p>    One night after striking out 20 times against Washington&#8217;s Max Scherzer, Detroit fanned only four times against Ubaldo Jimenez and three relievers.</p>\n<p>    Detroit&#8217;s Justin Upton played centre field for the first time since he manned the position at Double A Mobile in 2007. Normally a corner outfielder, Upton was moved to centre after the Tigers recalled Steven Moya from Triple-A Toledo and put him in left.</p>\n<p>    &#34;It&#8217;s a smaller yard, which allows us to put Upton in centre,&#34; manager Brad Ausmus said.</p>\n<p>    Upton played errorless ball. He broke in on a liner in the sixth inning but retreated in time to make the catch.</p>\n<p>    Jimenez allowed five hits and three walks over the first three innings, but Detroit&#8217;s lone run during that span scored on Martinez&#8217;s first-inning single.</p>\n<p>    Detroit made it 3-0 in the fourth. Saltalamacchia led off with his seventh homer, and Miguel Cabrera added a run-scoring groundout.</p>\n<p>    Detroit chased Jimenez during a two-run sixth that featured RBI singles by Cabrera and Martinez.</p>\n<p>    TRAINER&#8217;S ROOM</p>\n<p>    Tigers: OF Cameron Maybin (left wrist fracture) went 0 for 3 with a walk in his latest rehab game with Toledo on Thursday.

It allowed &#34;Russian athletes who most likely were doping to go undetected in arguably the largest sporting fraud of all time,&#34; the letter said.</p>\n<p>    Rodchenkov said that, as the mastermind of the plot, he&#8217;s the only person who can identify which samples were tampered with, and thus must oversee the testing. He suggests everything be filmed to &#34;ensure the integrity of the examination in an open and transparent way to the public.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The letter states that the Russian plot undercuts the entire anti-doping system.</p>\n<p>    It says the documentary has quotes from several anti-doping experts, including WADA officials, who all agree &#34;that if urine swapping and tampering of this nature ever occurred, the entire testing system would need to be scrapped.&#34;</p>\n<p>    In an interview before the letter went public Thursday, WADA&#8217;s incoming director general Olivier Niggli said the bottles needed to be looked at.</p>\n<p>    &#34;The allegation is that this was done by the (intelligence) service of Russia,&#34; he said. &#34;I guess the (intelligence) service of any country is able to do about anything. So, if you ask me if the Russians &#8230; can open a bottle, the answer is probably &#8216;yes.&#8217; But we&#8217;re talking about something that is so far away from normal anti-doping.&#8217;</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Olympics</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues/>\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/price_David.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/price_David.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Price dominates Astros as Red Sox win fifth straight</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/price-dominates-astros-red-sox-win-fifth-straight/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/price-dominates-astros-red-sox-win-fifth-straight//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 22:27:48 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 00:42:02 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2821889&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>David Price struck out 12, Mookie Betts had a three-run homer and Xander Bogaerts had a two-run shot to help the Boston Red Sox beat the Houston Astros 11-1 on Thursday night for their season-high fifth straight win.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>BOSTON &#8212; <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/david-price/388363\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"388363\">David Price</a> struck out 12, Mookie Betts had a three-run homer and Xander Bogaerts had a two-run shot to help the Boston Red Sox beat the Houston Astros 11-1 on Thursday night for their season-high fifth straight win.</p>\n<p>    Jackie Bradley Jr. singled twice and extended his hitting streak to 18 games, tying the longest streak in the major leagues this season. Bogaerts had three RBIs.</p>\n<p>    Thursday was supposed to be all about the first matchup between reigning Cy Young Award winner Dallas Keuchel and Price, last year&#8217;s runner-up.</p>\n<p>    Boston&#8217;s bats ensured Price (5-1) easily took this one. He rallied after a slow start and allowed a season-low one run over 6 2/3 innings, lowering his ERA to 6.00.</p>\n<p>    Keuchel (2-5) gave up 10 hits and eight runs. He has allowed five or more earned runs in four of his last five starts, something he did only three times last year.</p>\n<p>    The night started out with mixed results for Price. He gave up two singles to open the game but struck out six batters over the first two innings.</p>\n<p>    Houston threatened early despite coming off a 16-inning win against Cleveland on Wednesday night. The Astros were positioned for big innings but left five runners on base over the first three innings with only one run.</p>\n<p>    As they have in recent games, Price&#8217;s teammates had his back offensively.</p>\n<p>    Bogaerts hit his two-run blast over the Green Monster in the first inning. Bradley then extended his streak with an RBI single up the middle in the second inning that put the Sox up 3-1.</p>\n<p>    Since April 11, Boston has outscored opponents 40-11 in the opening inning and has hit 28 homers in its last 17 games. The Red Sox also have hit home runs in 13 straight games, their longest such streak since 2000.</p>\n<p>    TRAINER&#8217;S ROOM</p>\n<p>    Astros: Jason Castro (paternity list) is expected to rejoin the club Friday after he and his wife, Maris, welcomed a son, Brady, early Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>    Red Sox: Manager John Farrell said there isn&#8217;t a scheduled date for the next rehab start for RHP Joe Kelly (right shoulder impingement). There also hasn&#8217;t been discussion of when he might rejoin the major league squad. Farrell said he expects to sit down with Kelly in the next few days to make that determination. &#8230; LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (right patella subluxation) is scheduled for his fourth rehab start for Triple-A Pawtucket on Friday.</p>\n<p>    UP NEXT</p>\n<p>    Astros: RHP Lance McCullers (0-0) will make his season debut Friday night.

He wound up in the record book.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>  PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. &#8212; Shane Lowry was dreading the opening round of The Players Championship. He wound up in the record book.</p>\n<p>    Lowry thrives on confidence, and he hasn&#8217;t had much lately. And the practice rounds this week didn&#8217;t help, particularly on Wednesday. The Irishman had what he described as a meltdown during the back nine and &#34;I almost wasn&#8217;t looking forward to the week.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The front nine brought one birdie, one bogey, seven pars and no momentum. The back nine was a performance never seen.</p>\n<p>    Lowry became the first player to break 30 on the back nine of the Stadium Course at the TPC Sawgrass. He had five birdies and an eagle Thursday, and even missed two birdie chances from about 10 feet. Even so, he shot a 29 and wound up with a 65, just two behind leader Jason Day.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I had a chat with my coach and I picked some good targets out there and hit some good shots and managed to hole a few putts, which is key for me, and something I haven&#8217;t been doing recently,&#34; Lowry said. &#34;So it was nice.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The previous record for the back nine was 30 accomplished by 15 players, most recently by Geoff Ogilvy two years ago.</p>\n<p>    It started with a 35-foot birdie putt on No. 10, followed by a chip-in for eagle from left of the green. Lowry holed a pair of 6-foot birdie putts on the next two holes, had a simple up-and-down for birdie on the par-5 16th and closed out his record nine with a 12-foot birdie on the 18th.</p>\n<p>    And he didn&#8217;t even know he set a record.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I&#8217;ve just been told that&#8217;s the first time it&#8217;s ever been done,&#34; Lowry said. &#34;It&#8217;s probably as good a golf course as we play all year. It&#8217;s a proper test of golf. And to go out and do it on that nine was nice.&#34;</p>\n<p>    It was surprising based on how he felt Wednesday.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I was losing the head. I was almost thinking, &#8216;What&#8217;s the point of being here?&#8217; I felt like I was playing poorly and I was struggling on the greens,&#34; he said.</p>\n<p>    He was playing with Graeme McDowell on Wednesday, who noticed he was standing too close to the ball and suggested he move an inch or so away.</p>\n<p>    &#34;And for some reason, it just felt like it was easier to see my lines,&#34; Lowry said.</p>\n<p>    Still to be determined is whether that carries over the next three days, though it was a great start. Lowry&#8217;s hope was just to get to the weekend to get four rounds in before going home for the Irish Open.</p>\n<p>    &#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p>    EIGHT WAS ENOUGH: Adam Scott was bogey-free and headed toward a solid start in the afternoon until two bad swings that were penalized severely, as can happen at the TPC Sawgrass.</p>\n<p>    He was 3 under for his round when he hit 2-iron off the 18th tee that was too far left and found the water. And then it got worse. His next shot went right, reached a cart path and then kept bouncing until it was some 60 yards beyond the green. Scott tried to play a lofted pitch, but from that angle, it rolled down the slope of the green and into the water. And then he three-putted for a quadruple-bogey 8.</p>\n<p>    Scott had a 73 and headed into Friday below the cut line.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I was not far from an OK round with nothing exciting happening, and then it all happened,&#34; he said. &#34;It was far too exciting on the last.&#34;</p>\n<p>    He was shocked, in part because of the 8, and in part because of where the ball wound up. Scott figured he would be up by the grandstand. Asked if he could have played his fourth shot away from the green to avoid the water, he shrugged.</p>\n<p>    &#34;That&#8217;s not something &#8230; there&#8217;s not a good understanding of coming from 60 yards behind the green,&#34; he said. &#34;I don&#8217;t practice that shot much.&#34;</p>\n<p>    &#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p>    WHEN AN ISLAND IS MORE ABOUT LAND THAN WATER: Thousands of fans looking for a little excitement on the island-green 17th hole were disappointed.</p>\n<p>    The wind was only a rumour in the morning, increasing to about 10 mph in the afternoon. The green was relatively soft, and the pin position was front right. With the par 3 playing only 123 yards, it wasn&#8217;t the terror it can be.</p>\n<p>    Only six players hit tee shots into the water. That&#8217;s the fewest for the weekdays rounds since there were six water balls on the 17th in 2003, the year the PGA Tour began keeping such data.</p>\n<p>    &#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p>    NICE TOUCH: Branden Grace was facing a tough drive on the par-4 seventh hole when he was distracted by sudden noise from the gallery. He gathered himself and got back over the shot when the standard-bearer, a junior golfer, dropped the sign and grabbed it before it hit the ground causing Grace to back off again.</p>\n<p>    She was embarrassed, especially with everyone turning to look at her.</p>\n<p>    Jordan Spieth, coming off his second straight bogey, reached over and touched her elbow to get her attention. He smiled and whispered to her, &#34;I&#8217;ve seen that happen a lot. Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#34;</p>\n<p>    &#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p>    DIVOTS: Aaron Baddeley opened with a 69. He was the first alternate and got into The Players when Webb Simpson withdrew on Tuesday to get back to North Carolina for the birth of his daughter, Mercy. &#8230; Jason Day is trying to become only the third player to capture The Players Championship as No. 1 in the world. Tiger Woods did it twice (2001, 2013), while Greg Norman was No. 1 when he won in 1994. David Duval went to No. 1 by winning The Players in 1999. &#8230; Defending champion Rickie Fowler was 2 under for his round until he tried to punch a shot under the trees and onto the 18th green. It went through the green and into the water, and he made double bogey to open with a 72. The Players has never had a back-to-back winner.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Golf</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>PGA Tour</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/young_chris.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/young_chris.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Royals rejig rotation after placing pair on DL</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/royals-rejig-rotation-placing-pair-dl/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/royals-rejig-rotation-placing-pair-dl//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:56:27 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:56:27 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2821749&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The Kansas City Royals needed to revamp their rotation Thursday after putting struggling starters Chris Young and Kris Medlen on the 15-day disabled list.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>NEW YORK &#8212; The <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/teams/kansas-city-royals/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"kansas-city-royals\" data-league=\"mlb\">Kansas City Royals</a> needed to revamp their rotation Thursday after putting struggling starters Chris Young and Kris Medlen on the 15-day disabled list.</p>\n<p>    An MRI on Wednesday determined Young had a strained right forearm, and Meden has right rotator cuff inflammation.

Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov explained in great detail how he and those working there helped the host country beat the system in Sochi.</p>\n<p>The Times claimed dozens of Russian athletes, including 15 medallists, were doping before and during the Games.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the latest and biggest in a series of doping revelations about Russia in recent months that have centred mainly on swimming and track and field.</p>\n<p>Canada&#8217;s Beckie Scott, whose Olympic bronze in cross-country skiing in 2002 was eventually upgraded to gold when Russians were stripped of their medals, spoke at a World Anti-Doping Agency meeting Thursday in Montreal</p>\n<p>As the chair of WADA&#8217;s athletes committee urged the organization to use its influence to ban Russia from this summer&#8217;s Olympics in Rio, the Times article appeared to further fuel the furore.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I totally, fully support Beckie Scott&#8217;s statements and what she&#8217;s doing on behalf of clean athletes in the world,&#8221; Canadian hockey player Hayley Wickenheiser told The Canadian Press.</p>\n<p>The Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport urged both the international governing body of track and field and the International Olympic Committee to &#8220;stand firm&#8221; on suspending Russia&#8217;s track team from Rio this summer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The IAAF is due to report on Russia&#8217;s eligibility for the Rio Olympics on June 17,&#8221; CCES president Paul Melia said in a statement. &#8220;The clean athletes of the world are watching to see if it will exercise real leadership and do the right thing for clean sport.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What raised Wickenheiser&#8217;s eyebrows was the Times assertion that Russia&#8217;s &#8220;entire women&#8217;s hockey team was doping throughout the Games.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Russian women finished sixth in the tournament. Two members of that team were previously Wickenheiser&#8217;s teammates on the University of Calgary Dinos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To see women&#8217;s hockey implicated is a bit surprising because hockey is not a sport typically with a history of doping in its culture,&#8221; Wickenheiser said. &#8220;That was quite alarming for me to read that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Scott&#8217;s husband Justin Wadsworth coached Canada&#8217;s cross-country ski team in Sochi. The Times stated 14 skiers on Russia&#8217;s cross-country team were part of the doping scheme.</p>\n<p>Wadsworth was not at all surprised by the doping allegations or the extent of them detailed by the Times. That a whistleblower emerged to tell the tale does surprise him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The way these things usually break is someone on the inside finally sees something and they want to speak out and they have the guts to do it,&#8221; Wadsworth said. &#8220;In Russia, that&#8217;s a really dangerous thing. My hat goes off to the people who have spoken up thus far within the system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kids will hear it on the news tonight. They&#8217;ll ask about it. Our kids know and still ask questions about what happened with Beckie&#8217;s medal and the Russians.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Russia topped the medal table in both gold and total medals with 13 and 33 respectively in 2014. The country won 15 medals, including three gold, four years earlier in Vancouver and Whistler, B.C.</p>\n<p>Canada earned 25 medals &#8212; one less than in 2010 &#8212; with 10 of them gold in Sochi. Whether Canada&#8217;s medal count changes due to recent revelations remains to be seen and would take years in any case.</p>\n<p>Three-time Olympian Sam Edney of Calgary was part of Canada&#8217;s mixed relay team that finished fourth in luge.</p>\n<p>Luge isn&#8217;t a sport that would benefit much from chemical doping, Edney says. But he&#8217;s sad for any athlete, Canadian or otherwise, who now feels they weren&#8217;t competing on a level playing field in Sochi.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My first reaction is there&#8217;s always a lot of sadness,&#8221; Edney said. &#8220;As an athlete you want to be competing against athletes who are clean and hoping that the best athlete wins always.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope the athletes who were cheating, I hope they get caught and are punished for that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Added Wickenheiser: &#8220;As a member of the IOC athletes&#8217; commission, it&#8217;s part of my job to stand up for clean athletes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope it&#8217;s a watershed moment for clean sport. There&#8217;s too many athletes losing out on medal and performance positions because of athletes that aren&#8217;t clean.&#8221;</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Olympics</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues/>\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cory-schneider.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cory-schneider.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>Devils&#8217; Elias, Schneider both undergo surgery</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/devils-elias-schneider-undergo-surgery/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/devils-elias-schneider-undergo-surgery//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:43:11 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:43:11 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2821727&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The New Jersey Devils say forward Patrik Elias and goalie Cory Schneider had surgeries earlier this week.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>NEWARK, N.J. &#8212; The <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/new-jersey-devils/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"new-jersey-devils\" data-league=\"nhl\">New Jersey Devils</a> say forward <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/patrik-elias/170456\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"170456\">Patrik Elias</a> and goalie <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/cory-schneider/269241\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"269241\">Cory Schneider</a> had surgeries earlier this week.</p>\n<p>    The Devils say Elias had surgery on his right knee on Wednesday at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.

That from a guy who hit 31 homers with 115 RBIs for San Diego in 2012 and still is counted on to provide some power.</p>\n<p>    Headley has been working long hours in the batting cage lately and seeking advice from many hitters, including Yankees Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson.</p>\n<p>    The third baseman began the day batting just .178, although his recent swings had manager Joe Girardi thinking &#34;he was starting to look like the Chase Headley we knew.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Headley and Didi Gregorius hit two-run homers, and Starlin Castro added a solo shot to boost the Yankees.</p>\n<p>    Kansas City dropped three of four at Yankee Stadium and has lost 12 of 16 overall.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I&#8217;ll just be happy to get home. It seems like we haven&#8217;t been home in a year. We have a real comfort level there and enjoy playing at home,&#34; Royals manager Ned Yost said.</p>\n<p>    Nathan Eovaldi (3-2) worked around eight hits in five innings, and overcame getting struck on the leg by Lorenzo Cain&#8217;s hard one-hopper at the outset.</p>\n<p>    On Eovaldi&#8217;s last pitch, Salvador Perez nearly launched a go-ahead, three-run homer, but right fielder Carlos Beltran caught the ball at the top of the wall. Eovaldi wiped his brow as he walked off the mound while Perez put both hands on the top of his helmet.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Luckily, he was able to make the play,&#34; Eovaldi said.</p>\n<p>    Relievers Kirby Yates and Dellin Betances each followed with a perfect inning to hold a 5-3 lead. After the Yankees scored twice more, Andrew Miller worked a 1-2-3 eighth and Chasen Shreve threw a scoreless ninth.</p>\n<p>    Alex Gordon hit a solo home run and an RBI single for Kansas City. The Royals outhit the Yankees 9-7.</p>\n<p>    Ian Kennedy (4-3) lost in his first game back in the Bronx since the Yankees traded him after the 2009 season.</p>\n<p>    Castro homered in the first, then Headley connected in the second.</p>\n<p>    &#34;A step in the right direction,&#34; Headley said. &#34;Still got a long way to go.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Gregorius hit a two-run drive in the fourth.</p>\n<p>    Chien-Ming Wang, another former Yankees pitcher, gave up an RBI single to Castro and a bases-loaded walk to Brian McCann in the seventh.</p>\n<p>    ROSTER MOVE</p>\n<p>    The Yankees recalled lefty reliever Tyler Olson from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and sent down outfielder Ben Gamel. On Monday, Gamel got his first hit in the majors.</p>\n<p>    The Yankees also might be set to promote catcher Gary Sanchez from Triple-A. The 23-year-old made his big league debut last season with two games, got off to a solid start in the minors this year and could join the Yankees as an extra hitter, possibly even a DH with Alex Rodriguez on the disabled list.</p>\n<p>    TRAINER&#8217;S ROOM</p>\n<p>    Royals: RHP Chris Young (strained forearm) and RHP Kris Medlen (rotator cuff inflammation) were put on the 15-day disabled list. RHP Peter Moylan and LHP Scott Alexander came up from Triple-A.</p>\n<p>    Yankees: 1B Mark Teixeira returned to the lineup after missing two games because of neck spasms. He went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts&#8230; OF Jacoby Ellsbury (hip) hasn&#8217;t played since last Friday. &#8230; LHP CC Sabathia (groin strain) is set for a bullpen session Friday.</p>\n<p>    UP NEXT</p>\n<p>    Royals: RHP Edinson Volquez (3-3, 3.89 ERA) starts at home on Friday night against RHP Julio Teheran (0-3, 3.48) and the Braves. Atlanta has only played two games at Kauffman Stadium, both in 2013.</p>\n<p>    Yankees: RHP Luis Severino (0-5, 6.12) tries again for his first win when he faces ace Chris Sale (7-0, 1.79) and the visiting White Sox on Friday night.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Baseball</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>MLB</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>NYY</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stamkos_phaneuf.jpg\" />\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stamkos_phaneuf.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<media:credit>Sportsnet.ca</media:credit>\n\t\t<title>The Steve Dangle Podcast &#8211; May 12, 2016 &#8211; Stammergeddon 2.0</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/steve-dangle-podcast-may-12-2016-stammergeddon-2-0/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/steve-dangle-podcast-may-12-2016-stammergeddon-2-0//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:46:51 EDT</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 21:46:51 EDT</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Steve Dangle</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[http://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=2821849&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode, Adam blindsides Jesse &amp; Steve with the Stamkos Debate 2.0 with a surprise guest, plus lots of Penguins and Stars.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>On this episode, Adam blindsides Jesse &amp; Steve with the Stamkos Debate 2.0 with a surprise guest, plus lots of Penguins and Stars.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING!!!
