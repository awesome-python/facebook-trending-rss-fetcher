But, after the polls, they forgot these promises and raised issues of \u2018Love Jihad\u2019 and \u2018Ghar Wapsi\u2019. During Bihar polls, they raised the issue of beef. These days, they are speaking about patriotism&#8230;Will people learn patriotism from them? &#8230;We are happy they have started speaking about the tricolour.

Now the Congress had realized its mistake and there is an understanding based on the prevailing ground level situation in the state,&#8221; CPI-M politburo member M A Baby told PTI.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/bengal-alliance-will-not-have-impact-on-kerala-poll-cpim-2796447/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/udf-and-ldf-unite-in-fight-for-bjp-free-kerala-assembly/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/kerala-congress-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">UDF and LDF &#039;unite&#039; in fight for &#039;BJP-free Kerala Assembly&#039;</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-assembly-election-2016-congree-cpi-alliance/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/mamata2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Alliance yet to be sealed, Congress, CPI(M) holding joint protest</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cpm-west-bengal-election-the-communists-and-a-spectre-called-congress/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/cpm-red-2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">The communists and a spectre called Congress</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bengal-cong-wants-tie-up-with-left-says-no-to-mamata-banerjee/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/trinamool-cong-1200.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Bengal Cong wants tie-up with Left, says no to Mamata Banerjee</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/cpim-open-to-form-alliance-with-jayalalithaa-again-post-poll-sitaram-yechury/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yechuri-thumb.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">CPI(M) open to form alliance with Jayalalithaa again post poll: Sitaram Yechury</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/state-alliances-make-congress-ticklish/\"><span class=\"text\">State alliances make Congress ticklish</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>&#8220;It will not have any impact on our party&#8217;s prospects in Kerala because we are here fighting against the atrocities of the Congress government,&#8221; Baby said. However, a section of Kerala CPI(M) leaders felt that party comrades in Bengal campaigning together with Congress workers had given the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> ammunition for poll campaign in Kerala.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We very well understand that democracy needs to be restored in Bengal since hundreds of our party&#8217;s cadres have been killed in the five years of TMC rule, which is why an electoral understanding was chalked out with the Congress,&#8221; a CPI-M leader from Kerala, who did not wish to be named, said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But neither an alliance with the Congress nor sharing of platform with the Congress was the mandate of the central committee,&#8221; he said. Another Left leader from Kerala pointed out that it was a contradiction of the official party line adopted in the last party congress which called for keeping both the Congress party and the BJP at bay.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The CPI(M) is a national and not a regional party and it has to stick to the line adopted at the party congress,&#8221; he said on condition of anonymity. CPI(M) state secretariat member in Bengal Nepaldeb Bhattacharya said that &#8220;the alliance was a demand of the people of Bengal in order to fight against the autocratic rule of TMC&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In 2004, when the Left Front had supported the UPA at the centre, it did not have any impact,&#8221; he said. The BJP, which too is hoping to emerge as an alternative to UDF and LDF in Kerala, is going all out to make the alliance between the parties in Bengal an issue. &#8220;We are constantly saying this. Both the people of Kerala and Bengal will give them a befitting reply,&#8221; BJP national secretary Siddharth Nath Singh said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796447&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/bengal-alliance-will-not-have-impact-on-kerala-poll-cpim-2796447/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/west-bengal-polls-4801.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/west-bengal-polls-4801.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">west bengal polls 480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/17785f3ebe9c18421c5f0c2fe81c6aec?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">abhimanyuchakra</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/west-bengal-polls-7591.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">West Bengal elections, bengal elections 2016, Congress CPIM Bengal polls, Congress CPIM polls</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>AAP to launch &#8216;My Caste Hindustani&#8217; campaign in Haryana</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/aap-to-launch-my-caste-hindustani-campaign-in-haryana-2795837/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/aap-to-launch-my-caste-hindustani-campaign-in-haryana-2795837/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:51:25 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 00:51:25 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795837</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[AAP leader Naveen Jaihind  said the \"Kranti March\" would start from Rohtak and subsequently would be taken out from other places as well.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795837&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2745250 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/aap1.jpg\" alt=\"AAP workers protest Union Railway budget 2016 at Ahmedabad Railway station in front of live telecast on Thursday.

But the Article 276 (2) provides for capping and &#8220;with creative use of language&#8221; the government can accommodate.</p>\n<p>Referring to a media report that said some section in the government believes that GST is undesirable, the former Minister said, &#8220;the real opposition to GST is not coming from the Congress, it is coming from within the government.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He attacked the government for using Congress as &#8220;smoke screen&#8221; for the current situation of GST.</p>\n<p>Speaking about GDP growth figures, Ramesh said today nobody believes India&#8217;s GDP figures. &#8220;Chief Economic Advisor, RBI Governor, London economists and WallStreet Journal do not believe our GDP numbers,&#8221; he claimed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nobody is denying that we are having high growth rate. But the number put on GDP are highly suspicious. It (GDP growth) is somewhere between 5.9 per cent and 6.5 per cent and not 7.5 per cent,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Stating that India is growing and the country should grow much faster, Ramesh said, &#8220;For the first time, the credibility of GDP numbers are questioned. It has served the government purpose. I urge the government to pause a bit and come out with credible set of figures.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795394&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/congress-gst-bill-parliament-modi-government-kg-basin-jairam-ramesh-2795394/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jairam-ramesh2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/jairam-ramesh2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">jairam ramesh2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/jairam-ramesh1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Congress GST, GST Congress, Congress GST Bill, GST bill rajya sabha, GST parliament</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Kerala CM Oommen Chandy counters PM Modi: How can PM say Somalia exists in India?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/oomen-chandy-counters-narendra-modi-how-can-pm-say-somalia-exists-in-india/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/oomen-chandy-counters-narendra-modi-how-can-pm-say-somalia-exists-in-india/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 14:18:26 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:20:20 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794989</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Referring to the statement, Chandy said, \"This is unbecoming of a prime minister and has created a great deal of agony and protest.\"<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794989&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2795004\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/modi-chandy-759.jpg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Kerala CM Oommen Chandy. \" /> Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> and Kerala CM Oommen Chandy.\n<p>Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on Wednesday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for comparing Kerala to Somalia, saying he has insulted the state, and asked him to show some &#8220;political decency&#8221; by withdrawing his remark.</p>\n<p>In a hard-hitting letter to Modi, Chandy said the prime minister&#8217;s comparison of Kerala to Somalia during a recent campaign rally, claiming the state had &#8216;adverse&#8217; economic and social parameters, has &#8220;shocked&#8221; the people of the state as it has nothing to do with the ground realities.

He should apologise to the entire nation,\u201d said Shah.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2791679 size-full\" style=\"line-height:1.5;\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/degree.jpg\" alt=\"narendra modi, modi degree, modi ma degree, modi ba degree, arvind kejriwal, aam aadmi party, bjp, amit shah, arun jaitley, india news\" width=\"759\" height=\"1000\" /></p>\n<p>Defending Modi, Jaitley said Modi had appeared for the Delhi University examinations during 1977-78, adding that at the time he was not known to many. \u201cI knew this because I was a student union leader in Delhi University then&#8230;These allegations are coming from a party several of whose leaders are being prosecuted for fake degrees,\u201d said Jaitley.</p>\n<p>But AAP leader Ashutosh said Shah, Jaitley and Modi should apologise \u201cfor this forgery\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cNakal ke liye akal zaroorat hai (one needs brains to copy).

Is that even possible? There are a lot of glaring discrepancies in his degrees. We have proved that the degrees are forged. Amit Shah, Arun Jaitley and Modi should apologise for this forgery, which is a crime,\u201d said Ashutosh.</p>\n<p>The Congress, later, echoed AAP\u2019s line that there were discrepancies in the documents produced by the BJP. Spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the three BA marksheets of the Prime Minister, released by the BJP, were issued in 1977, 1978 and 1979, respectively. \u201cIf one has passed on February 17, 1979, how can one get a degree in 1978? The last marksheet is from February 1979, how did he get a degree in 1978?\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Surjewala also raised questions about how the Prime Minister\u2019s name was spelt in the documents. He said one marksheet spelled the Prime Minister\u2019s surname as \u201cMody\u201d and another \u201cModi\u201d. Surjewala alleged that the name of Modi\u2019s father was also spelt differently in different marksheets.</p>\n<p>Echoing AAP\u2019s allegations, he said, \u201cI have never seen in my entire student, academic and political career an \u2018entire political science\u2019 degree.\u201d This needs to be clarified,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Surjewala said that the Prime Minister should place his original marksheets and certificates in the public domain \u201cto clear the confusion\u201d.</p>\n<p>CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury demanded a probe into the Prime Minister\u2019s degrees. \u201cOne side says it\u2019s genuine and the other side says it\u2019s forged. Let there be a probe,\u201d Yechury said.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n</div><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2791622&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/pm-modi-degree-ba-ma-public-amit-shah-arun-jaitley-arvind-kejriwal-qualification-bjp-2791622/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kejriwal2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kejriwal2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kejriwal2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/eed96ea3a8c31a62edf33fc5d98d726a?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">tarishiverma</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kejriwal1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">modi degree row, modi degree, narendra modi, PM modi degree, modi ma degree, modi ba degree, arvind kejriwal, aam aadmi party, bjp, amit shah, arun jaitley, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/aap-bjp.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aap bjp</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/degree.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">narendra modi, modi degree, modi ma degree, modi ba degree, arvind kejriwal, aam aadmi party, bjp, amit shah, arun jaitley, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Lok Sabha passes Uttarakhand budget amid Congress walkout</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/lok-sabha-passes-uttarakhand-budget-amid-congress-walkout/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/lok-sabha-passes-uttarakhand-budget-amid-congress-walkout/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 00:18:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 06:34:55 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Liz Mathew]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2792431</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[ Congress members walked out of the lower house after their leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that the government could have waited till Tuesday for the trial of strength for the Harish Rawat government.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2792431&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2792443 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/page4.jpg\" alt=\"page\" /> <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> members walked out of the lower house after their leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that the government could have waited till Tuesday for the trial of strength for the Harish Rawat government.\n<p>On a day Supreme Court upheld Uttarakhand High Court\u2019s verdict that the nine disqualified MLAs cannot vote, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> Monday passed budget for the state with Opposition protesting against the government\u2019s \u201churry\u201d.</p>\n<p>Finance Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/arun-jaitley/\">Arun Jaitley</a> said passage of the budget was a constitutional necessity irrespective of the outcome of the floor test. \u201cThere was serious doubt and cloud (on) whether the budget was approved by the assembly on March 18,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Members from Congress, TMC and BJD, questioned the government\u2019s decision to move the bill on the eve of the floor test.

(PTI Photo/ TV grab)\n<p>Rejecting the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> demand for a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry into the AgustaWestland helicopter deal, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar Friday vowed to track down the recipients of alleged kickbacks.</p>\n<p>Parrikar, responding to a discussion on a calling attention motion in the Lok Sabha on the issue, said: \u201cI will ensure that the CBI and ED do their job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope members are satisfied and they will support the Government in finding the truth&#8230;The truth may lead to many unwanted realism&#8230;What we could not do in Bofors, may be we will do it in AgustaWestland&#8230;So, it is basically logical that money has been paid to someone from the other side, not from this side (Treasury benches).

He was checked by Mohammad Salim of the CPI(M) and Asaduddin Owaisi (MIM) a bit but was able to hold forth.</p>\n<p>The Defence Minister said the tender was submitted by AgustaWestland but the contract was given to UK-based Agusta Westland International Ltd (AWIL), which was not Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). \u201cActually, there are so many irregularities,\u201d he said, \u201c I am shocked and this is the biggest shock for me. How could you have given an order and accepted the tender of a company to whom you have not given the tender? I feel one paper is enough for the CVC. They had lost sense of proportion. They thought that they will be permanently in the ruling. The smell of money or the sight of Euro probably was so attractive or intoxicating that forgot about small little things\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will definitely recover (the) bribe \u2014 we will recover something like 398 million Euros, which is the damage we are claiming\u201d, he said, adding, \u201cThis process will start now\u201d. Referring to the Italian court proceedings, he said, \u201cWith this judgment, the criminal conspiracy is established. We will now get the documents very fast\u201d.</p>\n<p>Parrikar kept pointing at Congress benches, mentioned even \u201cAP\u201d (the initials in a handwritten note purportedly written by a middleman which the Opposition allegs refers to Ahmed Patel. Patel has strongly denied this and the middleman Christian Michel has distanced himself from the note).</p>\n<p>The Defence Minister maintained that the \u201centire corruption\u201d in the case took place during the UPA regime. He said while the decision on the contract was taken in 2010, Air chief S P Tyagi had retired in 2007. \u201cWho gave order in 2010?&#8230; How much that person has got we have to find that out&#8230;. He (Tyagi) was not there then\u201d, the Defence Minister said. Tyagi might \u201cmight have got just \u2018chillar\u2019 (loose change)\u201d.</p>\n<p>Tyagi and Gautam Khaitan, according to him, were \u201csmall people\u201d who just happened to wash their hands in a flowing ganga (behti ganga).\u201d However, the Government will \u201cfind out where the river was going\u201d, the minister declared.</p>\n<p>He said: \u201cAn investigation is underway with regard to those who washed hands in the flowing Ganga. Those who wash hands in the Ganga have an idea about temperature of the water, how fast the water is flowing. Based on that, we are assessing whether water was cold or hot, whether the water had Hindi, English, Italian or German and what was the issue\u201d.</p>\n<p>Parrikar said the decision to prescribe a higher cabin height of 1.8 m of the helicopter was taken by the UPA regime on May 9, 2005. He placed on the table of the House the minutes of the meeting that was chaired by the then NSA M K Narayanan. Making 1.8 metre height of the cabin mandatory ensured that only AgustaWestland could qualify.</p>\n<p>He said the then Defence Minister A K Antony was compelled to send the files to the CBI only when he realised that he would stand \u201cdisrobed of sainthood\u201d after a top official of Finmeccanica, the parent company of AgustaWestland, was arrested in Italy in connection with bribery in the deal.</p>\n<p>Regarding the Congress claim that the Italian judge had said that there was no evidence against Sonia, the Defence Minister said the judge had said that it was for India to investigate.</p>\n<p>Parrikar claimed there was an attempt to destroy evidence \u2014 a \u201cmysterious\u201d fire took place at Air Force headquarters on July 3, 2014. He said all files were burnt but three related to the AgustaWestland deal were saved as those had been kept by an official in his locked drawer.</p>\n<p>BJP\u2019s Anurag Thakur claimed that \u201crecently, a senior leader of the Congress had gone to meet a middleman who lives in Dubai.\u201d</p>\n<p>He alleged that the \u201cthen SPG chief, the NSA or the Defence Secretary &#8211; they are all occupying constitutional positions today\u201d. They were provided with immunity, he said, so that they cannot be questioned&#8230;today, somebody is a governor, somebody the CAG.\u201d</p>\n<p>In an apparent reference to Brajesh Mishra, Thakur\u2019s party colleague Nishikant Dubey said one could figure out now why the Congress give Padma Vibhushan to the person who had been the principal secretary in the PMO in 2003. He made it clear, \u201cWe did not give Padma Vibhushan to him\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2787487&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/efforts-were-made-by-previous-upa-govt-to-favour-agustawestland-parrikar-in-lok-sabha/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/parrikar-ls-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/parrikar-ls-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Parliament session</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/parrikar-ls-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">parrikar, manohar parrikar, agustawestland, congress, congress parliament, parliament, agustawestland parliament, parliament news, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>PM Modi lied to people about his BA degree, alleges Arvind Kejriwal</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/pm-modi-ba-degree-du-cheated-people-arvind-kejriwal-2788004/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/pm-modi-ba-degree-du-cheated-people-arvind-kejriwal-2788004/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 02:22:12 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 02:31:16 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2788004</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[In his affidavit for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi had stated that he received a BA degree from DU in 1978 and a MA degree from Gujarat University. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2788004&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2788010 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kejriwal1.jpg\" alt=\"kejriwal1\" /> <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/arvind-kejriwal/\">Arvind Kejriwal</a> alleged that a degree obtained by PM Modi&#8217;s namesake was shown as his own. (Source: PTI)\n<p>Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Friday claimed the Delhi University\u2019s (DU\u2019s) records showed that Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> had never enrolled in the university, contradicting the PM\u2019s claim that he obtained his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree from DU.</p>\n<p>Accusing the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> and the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> of being part of a mutually beneficial \u201cpact\u201d, Kejriwal said, \u201c&#8230; BJP is cursing Soniaji (Gandhi) but not arresting her. Congress is not questioning the PM\u2019s degree. BJP and Congress are holding dharnas against each other. Is this country foolish? Dono mein badi achchi setting hai (They have a very good pact).\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt emerges that he has done neither a BA nor an MA. Both degrees are fake. Firstly, he lied to the entire country, secondly, he lied in an affidavit and thirdly, the degrees are forged. This is a case of cheating. If the PM is accused of cheating under (IPC section) 420, this is a serious matter,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>However, senior BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Kejriwal was only \u201cdamaging the dignity\u201d of his own office. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that AAP has raised questions on PM Modi \u2018s educational qualification. It is sad that a chief minister is raising such baseless allegations against the PM. It is his habit to raise such untrue and baseless charge&#8230; By raising this issue, they are trying to protect the Congress, which has been facing public criticism on corruption. By doing this, he is also damaging the dignity of the post of CM.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/pm-modi-ba-degree-du-cheated-people-arvind-kejriwal-2788004/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/pm-modi-degree-ba-ma-public-amit-shah-arun-jaitley-arvind-kejriwal-qualification-bjp-2791622/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kejriwal2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">War of words erupts between AAP and BJP over PM Modi\u2019s degrees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agustawestland-chopper-scam-sonia-gandhi-narendra-modi-arvind-kejriwal-2788787/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kejriwal-protest-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Kejriwal steps up attack: PM Modi scared of Sonia Gandhi, of secrets going public</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/publish-pm-modis-ba-degree-online-kejriwal-writes-to-du-vice-chancellor-2785658/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/arvind-kejriwal2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Make PM Modi&#039;s BA degree public: Kejriwal to DU Vice-Chancellor</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/du-turned-away-leaders-seeking-information-on-pms-degree-aap-2785067/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/03/modi-kejriwal-2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">DU turned away leaders seeking information on PM\u2019s degree: AAP</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/pm-modi-degree-du-vc-aap-arvind-kejriwal/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/01/modikejriwal_m.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">AAP leaders visit Delhi University for PM Modi&#039;s grad records, Kejriwal tweets &#039;degree forged&#039;</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pm-modi-scored-62-3-in-ma-from-gujarat-univerisity-vc-2779138/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/narendra-modi480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Degree row- PM Modi MA with first class: Gujarat University</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>In his affidavit for the 2014 <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> elections, Modi had stated that he received a BA degree from DU in 1978 and a MA degree from Gujarat University.</p>\n<p>The Central Information Commission (CIC) had asked both DU and the Gujarat University to provide information about the Prime Minister\u2019s educational degrees. Responding to the CIC\u2019s order, Gujarat University Vice-Chancellor M N Patel said Modi had completed his post-graduation in political science in 1983 and scored 62.3 per cent as an external student of the varsity.</p>\n<p>Refusing to comment on Kejriwal\u2019s allegations, DU Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi had said Thursday, \u201cWe received the CIC\u2019s order yesterday. Our RTI cell is looking into it. I haven\u2019t had the chance to follow it up with them.\u201d He could not be contacted Friday despite repeated attempts.</p>\n<p>Terming the issue \u201cunfortunate\u201d, the Congress also asked the PM to place his degrees in the public domain. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the PM\u2019s educational qualification is under serious cloud and suspicion, permitting everybody to raise doubts on its authenticity or veracity. The PM, on the contrary, has chosen to maintain silence,\u201d said Congress communication department head Randeep Surjewala.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Kejriwal Friday claimed that a different person, also named Narendra Modi, had been a student of DU in 1975.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith great responsibility, I started talking about this day before yesterday. In DU, there is neither an enrollment form nor is his (Modi\u2019s) name in the register. He has not obtained a degree. His name is not even in the school of open learning. His name is nowhere. After all the probing, we found one Narendra Modi who had taken admission in 1975. He was from Alwar. His date of birth is 1958 while the Prime Minister\u2019s date of birth is 1950. He is a completely different Narendra Modi,\u201d said the chief minister.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe issue is not about how educated he is. Even if he was Class X or Class XII pass, we would have accepted it&#8230; people gave him a lot of votes, they reposed their faith in him. We respect that faith and that mandate. But there are things that point towards cheating,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>On how AAP managed to access DU\u2019s records, Kejriwal claimed the party had volunteers in various DU departments who had carried out an \u201cinvestigation\u201d into the matter and procured copies of various documents.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2788004&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/pm-modi-ba-degree-du-cheated-people-arvind-kejriwal-2788004/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kejriwal2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kejriwal2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kejriwal2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kejriwal1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kejriwal1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>BJP has only development in mind, Modi tells Kerala voters</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/narendra-modi-bjp-kerala-rally-speech-elections-2787679/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/narendra-modi-bjp-kerala-rally-speech-elections-2787679/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 17:14:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 17:14:52 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Shaju Philip]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2787679</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[\"I am requesting you to experiment with NDA to eradicate poverty, unemployment and arrest price rise,\" said PM Modi.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2787679&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2770134 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/narendra-modi759.jpg\" alt=\"Narendra Modi, Modi Kerala, Modi pallakad, Modi kerala elections, Modi in Kerala,\" /> &#8220;I am requesting you to experiment with NDA to eradicate poverty, unemployment and arrest price rise,&#8221; said PM Modi.

Without directly taking his name, Das said that Kumar was after power, but added that the \u2018fever\u2019 would die down soon.</p>\n<p>The sharp reaction comes in the wake of Nitish Kumar scheduled to take his prohibition campaign beyond Bihar by attending a programme on prohibition in Dhanbad, where he has been invited by an all-women outfit on May 10. This is likely to be the first programme after which Kumar may attend many other functions in different states advocating prohibition.</p>\n<p>Das said this while interacting with media persons in Ranchi\u00a0on the occasion of completion of one year of \u201cJan Samvad\u201d programme in which he listens to the complainants directly from across the state.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/bihar-prohibition-jharkhand-cm-says-nitish-kumar-made-people-of-bihar-addicts-for-10-years-is-after-power-2782959/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/nitish-kumar-kickstarts-anti-liquor-campaign-in-jharkhand-2793946/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/nitish-kumar-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Nitish Kumar kickstarts anti-liquor campaign in Jharkhand</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/degree-row-pm-modi-nitish-kumar-non-issue-aap-bjp-kejriwal-ashutosh-sonia-gandhi/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/nitish-kumar-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">PM Modi&#039;s degree controversy &#039;non-issue&#039;: Nitish Kumar</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/jharkhand-cm-raghubar-das-targets-nitish-kumar-whos-responsible-for-bihars-liquor-addiction-2783241/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/raghubar-das-m.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Jharkhand CM targets Nitish: Who\u2019s responsible for Bihar\u2019s liquor addiction?</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/jharkhand-cm-raghubar-das-minister-saryu-rai-acquitted-in-2008-assault-and-riot-case/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/raghubar-das-m.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das, minister Saryu Rai acquitted in 2008 assault and riot case</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/jharkhand-serves-notice-to-ex-cs-over-violent-gestures/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/01/sajal.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Jharkhand serves notice to ex-CS over \u2018violent gestures\u2019</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/jharkhand-bjp-slams-nitish-kumar-for-raking-up-tribal-cm-issue/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/12/raghubar_t.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Jharkhand: BJP slams JD(U) leaderNitish Kumar for raking up tribal chief minister issue</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Asked about prohibition in Bihar and the scheduled visit of Kumar to Dhanbad, the Chief Minister said that everybody was free in a democracy to go anywhere.</p>\n<p>However, Das added, \u201cBihar mein sharab-bandi unhone kiya, iske liye dhanyavad..\u2026lekin das varshon tak Bihar ko nashedi kisne banaya\u2026.kaun jimmevar hai\u2026.ye bhi Bihar ki janata poochhegi (Many thanks to him for implementing prohibition\u2026but for 10 years, who made Bihar people addict; who is responsible for it; people of Bihar will ask this too).\u201d</p>\n<p>Das went on to add: \u201cAapne satta ke nasha ke liye das varsh tak nashedi banaya\u2026..unko sharaab ke nashe se kuchh matlab nahin hai\u2026.unko doosra cheez ka nasha chadh gaya hai\u2026.aap samajh rahe hain na\u2026..oo bukhar bhi jaldi utar jaayega (You made people addict for 10 years for your lust of power\u2026.he does not have anything to do with prohibition\u2026.I hope you understand\u2026..that fever too will die down soon).\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2007, Kumar had come up with a liquor policy for Bihar through which liquor became available in panchayats.

Any decision, if at all, will be taken after due consideration.</p>\n<p>Das also criticised the hullabaloo over prohibition saying nobody was talking about development in Bihar. Who will create jobs in Bihar for many unemployed youth, he asked.</p>\n<p>To a related query, Das further said: \u201cHumara role model Bihar nahin hai\u2026humara role model hai Gujarat (Our role model is not Bihar; our role model is Gujarat).\u201d</p>\n<p>Post-prohibition, Bihar CM had sent a letter to Das seeking adequate measures to check illegal activities on border areas with regard to prohibition. He was reportedly not pleased about the casual manner in which Das had handled his request.</p>\n<p>Das had forwarded Kumar\u2019s letter for further action to the Excise department. Department officials said that necessary instructions were issued to the districts bordering Bihar to prevent any illegal activity on account of prohibition in the neighbouring state.</p>\n<p>They also claimed that they had extended all possible support to their Bihar counterparts, something that was requested by the latter before the ban was implemented on April 1.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2782959&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/bihar-prohibition-jharkhand-cm-says-nitish-kumar-made-people-of-bihar-addicts-for-10-years-is-after-power-2782959/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/raghubar-das2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/raghubar-das2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Chief Minister of Jharkhand Raghubar Das.

Jatav, who a BSP worker in Moradabad, was brought in the Congress as part part of party\u2019s \u2018Dalit Leadership Programme\u2019. Under this programme, the Congress has spent months across constituencies identifying new Dalit faces ahead of the state polls next year.</p>\n<p>Admitting that it fielding Jatav in Bilari is a part of their new experiment, Bhagwati Chaudhary, chairman of the UP Congress SC department, said, \u201cWe have no hesitation in saying that he came into the party recently during our exercise to bring in active Dalit faces, who could emerge as leaders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, when the two byelections were announced, party decided to experiment with fielding a Jatav face on a general seat. We might not win but the vote share in this election will help us define our future strategy,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>In 2012, SP\u2019s Hazi Irfan, who had won from the seat, was given a close fight by BSP\u2019s Laxmi Singh Saini. While Irfan had got about 55,694 votes, BSP candidate had got 54,154 votes. The RLD candidate, who was supported by Congress, could get only about 10,000 votes.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongress has given a chance to a Jatav face like me on a general seat.

(Express Photo)\n<p>Even as the Canadian government denied permission to Punjab <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> president and sitting MP Captain Amarinder Singh from holding political rallies and interactions in their country, the Aam Aadmi Party is running a massive campaign \u2014 \u2018Chalo Punjab 2017\u2019 \u2014 to woo the NRIs.</p>\n<p>The campaign is presenting Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national convenor <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/arvind-kejriwal/\">Arvind Kejriwal</a> as \u201cthe only hope\u201d for Punjab and asking NRIs to reach India by December 1 this year as Punjab goes to the polls in 2017.</p>\n<p>At the Vaisakhi nagar kirtans (Sikh religious gatherings) held at Surrey and Toronto, the bastion of Punjabi population in Canada, AAP volunteers wearing T-shirts with photographs of Kejriwal interacted with visitors and also distributed promotion material of the party.</p>\n<p>The AAP calendar with photographs of twelve senior leaders, including Kejriwal, H S Phoolka, Bhagwant Mann, Durgesh Pathak, etc, were distributed to Punjabi community who were asked to visit Punjab and help AAP candidates during elections.</p>\n<p>Celebrated with great enthusiasm, Vaisakhi Nagar kirtans in Canada are believed to the largest Sikh gatherings. Surrey gathering attracts maximum crowds with over three lakh Punjabi NRIs attending it.</p>\n<p>Speaking to <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a> over phone, Joban Randhawa from AAP Canada team said, \u201cChalo Punjab 2017 is receiving huge response from Punjabis in Canada. Our target is to send 1.17 lakh NRIs to India by December 1 this year. This comes out to be 1,000 NRIs per constituency in Punjab. We are asking them to help AAP candidates in their constituencies. They cannot vote but can campaign for them, ask their families/friends to vote for them and contribute financially.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chalo Punjab 2017 is also being run by the US, Australia and New Zealand teams of Aam Aadmi Party.</p>\n<p>At the nagar kirtan held at Toronto Sunday, close to 2,000 copies of calendars presenting Kejriwal as \u2018Janata ka CM\u2019 were distributed to NRIs. Also, trucks with party symbol \u2018broom\u2019 and portrait of Kejriwal are being run on roads of Canada by the volunteers. They too display the message for NRIs to go to Punjab by December 1, 2016.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Canadian government must be having some reason to stop Captain Amarinder Singh from holding rallies here. Canada is a democracy and we have faced no problems in our Chalo Punjab campaign till now. Students, youths, senior citizens, women \u2014 all are supporting it. At the nagar kirtans, we also held a membership drive for AAP,\u201d said Randhawa.</p>\n<p>Tajinder Singh, a transporter settled in Surrey for almost 15 years, said, \u201cThere is an inclination towards AAP among the NRI community. Earlier, during the 2012 and 2007 polls, Congress and SAD leaders had visited Canada and held interactions but never before did we we this kind of enthusiasm as NRIs have for Kejriwal. During nagar kirtan here, AAP volunteers had put up a camp and there were huge crowds. People were curious to know about their plans. During our social gatherings too, people are talking about AAP.\u201d</p>\n<p>In case of Captain Amarinder Singh who too was scheduled to hold \u2018political interactions and meetings\u2019 , the Canadian government invoked the provisions of \u2018Global Affairs Canada\u2019 (GAC) policy that forbids \u201cforeign governments to conduct election campaigns in Canada or establish foreign political parties and movements in Canada\u201d. A complaint against him has also been filed by \u2018Sikhs for Justice\u2019 in Canadian court, alleging torture on Sikhs during his tenure as CM.</p>\n<p>Speaking to The Indian Express, senior AAP leader and Supreme Court lawyer HS Phoolka, who toured Canada last month, said, \u201cThere must be an apprehension of law and order problem, which forced the Canadian government to cancel Captain\u2019s interactions. My tours and felicitation were purely based on human rights works I did in 30 years. Even Canadian MPs and MLAs call me a role model. I carried all interactions without my party logo, so a lot depends on how programmes are organised. Our NRI team is running Chalo Punjab 2017 campaign abiding by all laws of Canada. Restrictions are for outsiders, not Canadian citizens.\u201d</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2770505&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/aap-punjab-elections-canada-campaign-2770505/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/aap-canada-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/aap-canada-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">AAP-CANADA-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/aap-canada-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aap, aap punjab, punjab elections, punjab polls, canada campaign, canada punjab election campaign, aap punjab campaign, punjab aap campaign, punjab news, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>On the ground in West Bengal, bitter foes try to be friends</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-cpim-congress-alliance-rahul-gandhi-howrah-rally-2767602/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-cpim-congress-alliance-rahul-gandhi-howrah-rally-2767602/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2016 03:47:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2016 03:47:09 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Esha Roy]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2767602</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Congress has fielded candidates for five of the 16 assembly seats in Howrah, while the CPI(M) is contesting the remaining seats.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2767602&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2767606 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/congress-cpim-bong-759.jpg\" alt=\"cpim, congress, west bengal, cpim congress alliance, congress cpim alliance, west bengal polls, bengal polls, bengal elections, west bengal news, india news\" /> CPI(M) and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> flags at <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a>\u2019s rally in Howrah on Saturday. (PTI Photo)\n<p>For over two decades (1969 to 1991), the CPI(M) won the Sankrail assembly constituency in Howrah district. The Congress wrested the seat in 1996, but the Trinamool Congress (TMC) won the next three assembly elections from this semi-rural, semi-industrial belt.</p>\n<p>Now considered a TMC stronghold, Howrah \u2014 along with Hooghly, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas, which go to polls in the next two phases on April 25 and April 30 \u2014 has become the battleground for the newly-formed coalition between the Left and the Congress on the one hand, and the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC on the other.</p>\n<p>The Congress has fielded candidates for five of the 16 assembly seats in Howrah, while the CPI(M) is contesting the remaining seats.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a formal alliance,\u201d says CPI(M) Politburo member Mohammad Salim. \u201cIt is more of a people\u2019s alliance. The demand came from the ground. While talks began in December-January, the fact is that there was an invisible cooperation between workers and unions of non-Trinamool parties long before that \u2014 for nearly a year. The workers took up issues together and we saw that there was pressure to get together,\u2019\u2019 says Salim.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/bengal-alliance-will-not-have-impact-on-kerala-poll-cpim-2796447/\">Bengal alliance will not have impact on Kerala poll: CPI(M)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-elections-cooch-behar-polls-over-ex-enclave-dwellers-wait-for-ration-cards-rice-2794201/\">Cooch Behar: Polls over, former enclave dwellers wait for ration cards, rice</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/west-bengal-elections-over-threats-and-violence-continue-2790839/\">West Bengal elections over, threats and violence continue</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-polls-end-congress-tmc-cpm-2788439/\">End of West Bengal polls: They broke enough sweat, now ready with the break</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/west-bengal-elections-2016-trinamool-congress-cpim-congress-bjp-2787589/\">West Bengal Elections: If TMC wins, it will face strongest opposition in decades</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>Sanata Mandal, a 55-year-old CPI(M) worker in Sankrail, echoes Salim. \u201cIn Sankrail, there is nothing unusual about this alliance. Seventeen months ago, the Delta Jute Mill in Sankrail closed down, leaving hundreds of workers jobless. For the past year, both the CPI(M) and Congress trade unions have been leading protests and trying to get the jute mill to re-open,\u2019\u2019 he says.</p>\n<p>Mandal is one of the many who have turned up for CPI(M) Sankrail candidate Anirban Hazra\u2019s rally. The ground is decked up with CPI(M) and Congress flags. The rally was jointly organised by workers of both parties.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course we helped to organise this rally just as much as any CPI(M) worker,\u2019\u2019 says Congress worker Sadiq Ali Mondol. \u201cAnd no, we don\u2019t like the CPI(M), their ideology is different from ours. We have shared a violent history with them. They beat up our workers when they were in power. They made our lives miserable. But anything is better than this (TMC). The Trinamool has forcibly taken over our offices. They have been buying off our panchayat members. For any work that you need to get done, you have to pay a commission. So, whether you want to build a road or appoint a teacher at a local primary school, it all involves big cash,\u201d says Mondol.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople have been asking why we would ally with the Left. In 2011, we were with the Trinamool. We gave up our seats for them. We didn\u2019t want to, but we did it for the greater good. The TMC gave us one seat in 2011. At least we have five seats in the district this year. The Congress has been sacrificing its seats for years now. We brought the Trinamool to power in 2011. We will bring the Left to power in 2016,\u2019\u2019 he says.</p>\n<p>Congress worker Alok Koney\u2019s name was shortlisted for the Sankrail seat. But he was asked to stand down in favour of the CPI(M). Now Koney is in charge of all rallies in the area, on behalf of the Congress. \u201cOnce the party decided, that\u2019s it. It is our responsibility to throw our full weight behind the jot\u2019s (alliance\u2019s) candidates and ensure that they win,\u2019\u2019 says Koney.</p>\n<p>It hasn\u2019t been a smooth journey for the alliance. With the Left and Congress being rivals in the Kerala assembly elections, and given the shared history of hostility between different parties of the alliance in Bengal, there was opposition from both the Left and Congress.</p>\n<p>Congress insiders say that senior leaders Manas Bhuiyan and Deepa Dasmunshi were among those who opposed the alliance. \u201cRahul Gandhi sent an emissary to check the ground reality and found that the district leaders were actually in favour of it,\u2019\u2019 says a party insider.</p>\n<p>Senior Congress leader O P Mishra says the first glimmer of a possible alliance came when he arranged an event to celebrate Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s 125th birth anniversary in November last year. \u201cThis was barely seven days after the Bihar results. All the non-TMC and non-<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> leaders came. The Left sent a 10-member delegation including Surjya Kanta Mishra. That is what I would consider the political beginning,\u2019\u2019 he says.</p>\n<p>The \u201cmahagathbandhan\u2019\u2019, as Mishra calls it, comprises not only the Congress and CPI(M), but others like the RSP, JD(U) and Akranto Amra \u2014 a citizens\u2019 party formed to support those who have been charged with <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/\">sedition</a> by the TMC government. Akranto Amra\u2019s star candidate is Jadavpur University Professor Ambikesh Mahapatra, who was arrested for sharing Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee\u2019s caricature.</p>\n<p>The Left faced a fiercer fight from within. Senior CPI(M) leader in Bardhaman, Amar Haldar, says he was opposed to the alliance, and still is. \u201cThere are too many ideological differences. But now that the party has taken a certain stand, we are all backing it despite our own personal views,\u201d he says. The CPI(M)\u2019s Bardhaman committee is known to have opposed the alliance the most when the discussions were still underway.</p>\n<p>Earlier a Left bastion, Bardhaman saw a tough fight in 2011. Of the 26 assembly constituencies in the district, the TMC won 13 seats while the CPI(M) was reduced to nine seats \u2014 it won most of these with slim margins. In three seats that the TMC won, the two parties had equal vote share \u2014 Memari (47 per cent), Ketugram (45 per cent) and Raniganj (47 per cent). This year, the CPI(M) will contest 21 seats while the Congress has five.</p>\n<p>Party insiders say it was the Bengal units of both the Congress and CPI(M) that put pressure on their central leadership to agree to an alliance. And while most districts in Bengal have fallen in line, Murshidabad, with its 22 assembly seats, is a different story.</p>\n<p>Both the Congress and RSP have fielded candidates in what they are now calling a \u201cfriendly fight\u201d. \u201cI still have reservations and many questions about the \u2018jot\u2019. For instance, what happens after the elections? How is a common mandate to be decided? After the Congress refused to budge, we did not see any reason not to field candidates from the same seats,\u201d says RSP leader Kshiti Goswami.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2767602&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-cpim-congress-alliance-rahul-gandhi-howrah-rally-2767602/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/congress-cpim-bong-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/congress-cpim-bong-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">congress-cpim-bong-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/congress-cpim-bong-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">cpim, congress, west bengal, cpim congress alliance, congress cpim alliance, west bengal polls, bengal polls, bengal elections, west bengal news, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Tamil Nadu campaign heats up: Jaya slams Kani for Tamil deaths in Lanka</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/tamil-nadu-polls-karunanidhi-dmk-aiadmk-jayalalithaa-queens-rule/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/tamil-nadu-polls-karunanidhi-dmk-aiadmk-jayalalithaa-queens-rule/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2016 02:28:34 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2016 02:28:29 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Arun Janardhanan]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2767328</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Defeat \u2018cruel govt\u2019 of \u2018Maharani\u2019: Karunanidhi<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2767328&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2759425\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/jaya1.jpg\" alt=\"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalitha (PTI photo)\" /> Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalitha (PTI photo)\n<p>With barely three weeks left for the May 16 Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, Chief Minister and AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa addressed her seventh election rally in Trichy and DMK chief M Karunanidhi started his campaign from Chennai, both launching frontal attacks.</p>\n<p>Unlike her previous rallies, Jayalalithaa took on the Karunanidhi family, alleging that it was Karunanidhi\u2019s promise that led to the death of many Tamils in Sri Lanka. \u201cKarunanidhi\u2019s daughter Kanimozhi demanded Tamils to surrender to the Sinhalese army before the end of the (Lankan civil) war.

Calling it a \u201ccruel government\u201d, he said, \u201cIt is the time to defeat them.\u201d Saidapet, on the banks of Adyar River, was badly affected in the December 2015 floods.</p><img alt=\"\"

(Express Photo by Virender Singh Negi)\n<p>A day after he went back to being the former chief minister of Uttarakhand, Harish Rawat looked his usual unruffled self, making jokes, pointing to a laughing photograph of Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> on the wall before declaring, \u201cMogambo khush hua\u201d. But he was worried.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am now a very worried man. My task was always difficult, now it is even more uphill. We had a roadmap for the state, but now that rhythm has been broken. I have to start afresh. I have only a few months left and to become a good chief minister is a daunting task,\u201d said Rawat, speaking exclusively to The Sunday Express.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul>\n<p>Rawat took over as CM of the hill state from Vijay Bahuguna, now the leader of the nine <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> rebels, in the aftermath of the 2013 Kedarnath disaster and its mismanagement. With the Uttarakhand assembly polls scheduled for 2017, Rawat fears time is running out for him. \u201cOne tsunami destroyed everything in the state in 2013, now the second, Modi tsunami, has destroyed everything we built in these past two years,\u2019\u2019 he said.</p>\n<p>Confident about proving his majority if the floor test is held on April 29, Rawat dismissed the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>\u2019s claim of enjoying a majority. The BJP has 28 members, the Congress had 36 MLAs before the nine rebels were disqualified and enjoys the support of six MLAs of the Progressive Democratic Front in a House of 70 members (the 71st is nominated). \u201cThe BJP says they can form a majority. I don\u2019t know what mathematics they are working with,\u201d said Rawat.</p>\n<p>But what if the nine Congress rebels are allowed to vote on April 29? \u201cWith the matter of the rebels still in court, I won\u2019t like to comment on it, except to say that the one thing that is clear is that the spirit of the anti-defection Bill is to curb the Aaya Ram, Gaya Ram phenomenon,\u201d he replied.</p>\n<p>While the breakaway group has brought into open the fissures that have always run deep in the Uttarakhand Congress, Rawat denied the charge that he couldn\u2019t keep his house in order. \u201cIf someone had a grouse, they should have found a solution within the party. This can\u2019t be a justification for defection. Otherwise, in a small state, you can always have a situation where two-three people are unhappy&#8230; what if they join the opposition,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>To criticism that he didn\u2019t reach out to the disgruntled in his party, Rawat said nothing could be further from the truth. \u201cI have accommodated them to the hilt&#8230;It was a fishy deal with the BJP that only God, they themselves or their bank balances can tell,\u201d he said. \u201cThis defection is engineered by forces outside the state,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>Responding to criticism that he showed undue haste in calling two cabinet meetings in the 24 hours that he was reinstated as CM after the Uttarakhand High Court quashed President\u2019s Rule on Thursday, Rawat said, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t start work, I would have been guilty of creating a void in Uttarakhand&#8230;. In the first cabinet meeting, about 12-13 decisions were taken&#8230; The second cabinet meeting&#8230;was necessitated by the high court order that fixed the date of the floor test. On whose request would the floor test take place?

(Express Photo by Subham Dutta)\" /> The body of Sheikh Fazal Haque, a CPM polling agent who was killed Thursday night, reaches his village Friday. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta)\n<p>Simmering tension in a West Bengal village split in two political halves erupted on Thursday night when a CPI(M) worker and a polling agent of the party were allegedly hacked to death by TMC supporters, hours after voting ended in the third phase of Assembly elections in the state.</p>\n<p>According to police and residents of Lodhna village in the Khandaghosh Assembly constituency of Bardhaman, polling agent Sheikh Fazal Haque (56) and Dukhi Ram Dal (56) were attacked with lathis and iron rods as they were returning home at about 8 pm on Thursday.</p>\n<p>The two were rushed to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital but died soon after, police said.</p>\n<p>While both parties blamed each other for the clash that led to the killings, police officers traced the violence to a political upheaval in 2011 when the TMC made deep inroads into what had been a Left stronghold since 1942.</p>\n<p>So much so, that Lodhna, on the banks of the Damodar river, has since split into two halves \u2014 Gainpara, comprising TMC sympathisers, and Metepara, which has stuck with the Left. Haque and Dal were from Metepara. Thursday\u2019s attack took place on a narrow bridge connecting Gainpara and Metepara, said police.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter an explosion, it seems Haque tried to flee but got entangled in some netting on the edge of a field and was killed there. Dal was chased for a while and then hacked,\u201d said Sub-Inspector Mohammad Saifuddin, who was on duty in the area at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p>One \u201clive\u201d bomb and residue from several exploded bombs were later recovered from the site, said police.</p>\n<p>According to a senior police officer, tension escalated after CPI(M)\u2019s sitting MLA Nabin Chandra Bag moved to the TMC last November and announced that he would be contesting the Assembly elections.</p>\n<p>In 2011, the TMC had won 15 of the 25 Assembly seats from the district, with the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> winning one and the Left Front taking eight. This time, with the Left-Congress alignment threatening to eat into the ruling party\u2019s tally, the TMC has been desperate to retain control. While 40-year-old Bag bagged the TMC ticket this time, 30-year-old Asima Roy was the CPI(M) candidate from Khandaghosh, a reserved constituency.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2766075 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/cpm1.jpg\" alt=\"CPM workers hacked, CPM workers killed, CPM workers lodhna, CPM lodhna,\" /> A man lying at a local hospital after some of his political rivals cut his ear after he cast his vote to CPI(M) candidate \u00a0in Burdwan, Thursday. (PTI Photo)\n<p>\u201cHere, politics isn\u2019t something that ends with elections. The party high command has promised us that we will win in this election. So we are fighting for our party, doing what we can. This is a fight for survival. If TMC wins the elections, we will be killed,\u201d said Bijoy Dal, the 35-year-old son of Dukhi Ram Dal.</p>\n<p>\u201cViolence is a way of life here,\u201d said an officer at the Khandaghosh police station. \u201cThis village is notorious for its production of hand-made guns, bombs and fake gold coins. Earlier, when the Left was in power, such villages in Khandaghosh were impossible to enter,\u201d he said, adding that three TMC workers were killed during clashes in the Khandaghosh area last June.</p>\n<p>Most of the villagers at Lodhna \u2014 part of West Bengal\u2019s rice belt \u2014 are descendants of sharecroppers who were given land in the 1970s as part of land reforms pioneered by the Left. \u201cBeing a CPI(M) worker in a village like this used to be a job in itself. It was something we could fall back on in case of emergencies. That changed with the TMC coming into power. So many people are now joining the TMC and voting for them,\u201d said Mohammad Rafique, a 65-year-old farmer.</p>\n<p>Family members of the two killed on Thursday and CPI(M) workers in the village alleged that Haque and Dal were returning home after polling when they were ambushed by over 100 TMC workers armed with knives, sticks, iron rods and bombs.</p>\n<p>But police said the deaths were caused by clashes between both parties. \u201cThe CPI(M) workers tried to attack TMC workers but were ambushed instead. No arrests have been made. But we have detained four men and are questioning those who were present there. We will investigate the matter,\u201d said Deputy Superintendent of Police D Bhattacharya.</p>\n<p>But family members of the deceased alleged that police failed to heed repeated warnings of an impending attack by TMC supporters. \u201cI had warned police that there would be violence. They are cooking up this story of us attacking them. The simple fact is we don\u2019t have the kind of numbers anymore to pull off an attack. About a month ago, I was attacked and had my ribs fractured. The police did nothing,\u201d alleged Dal.</p>\n<p>TMC candidate Bag and the party\u2019s block president Alok Majhi denied allegations of their workers\u2019 involvement in the violence.</p>\n<p>Describing the attack, SI Saifuddin said, \u201cIt was very dark&#8230; about a 100-odd men appeared with knives and bombs. Apart from me, there were five other personnel from the Central armed forces. We were hopelessly outnumbered. We tried to disperse them with a lathi-charge but couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>What has added to the resentment among CPI(M) supporters in the village is the discovery of a \u201clive\u201d bomb from the site almost 20 hours after the attack. The bomb, weighing about 250 gm, was spotted by a TV journalist, said police.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven after we informed police about the bomb, it took them about another half an hour to remove it,\u201d alleged Ayesha Begum, a local resident.<br />\nSaid SI Saifuddin, \u201cI checked the site myself and found nothing. It is possible the bomb may have been placed later by some mischievous elements.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2766068&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/after-voting-violence-and-murder-2-cpm-workers-killed-in-clashes-with-tmc/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/bengal-cpm-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/bengal-cpm-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Bengal-CPM-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/bengal-cpm-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">The body of Sheikh Fazal Haque, a CPM polling agent who was killed Thursday night, reaches his village Friday.

(File/PTI)\n<p>Anticipating attack when the Parliament session starts Monday, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> Friday upped the ante against <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> by accusing it of coining terms like \u201cHindu terror\u201d for the sake of vote bank politics. Congress hit back, alleging that the BJP-led government had pressured NIA into weakening the probe into Malegaon and Best Bakery cases, among others.</p>\n<p>BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said, \u201ccourt proceedings are on but some things are apparent from facts that have emerged out of statements of probe officers&#8230;much before any chargesheet was filed, the term \u2018Hindu terror\u2019 had already been coined by UPA. <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a> told American officials that \u2018Hindu terror\u2019 is most worrying. Digvijaya Singh released a book \u201826/11 an RSS conspiracy\u2019. These were not conclusions of probe but their political eagerness for vote bank politics.\u201d</p>\n<p>Trivedi also referred to media reports claiming that terror links of Ishrat Jahan who was killed in an encounter in Gujarat were revealed by David Headley in 2010, but never made public.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to ask Congress \u2014 was the then PM or UPA chairperson informed when then home minister changed the affidavit on Ishrat Jahan (case)? Under what circumstances did the government then permit senior Congress leaders to speak to probe officials, because in many of their statements they claimed to have spoken to officials,\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Trivedi added: \u201cIt is deplorable that in this age of global terror, when India is among the worst-affected nations, Congress coined the term \u2018saffron terror\u2019 and linked an entire community and a portion of the flag to terror. They should apologise\u201d.</p>\n<p>Replying to a question on the Uttarakhand situation, he said Congress should \u201clook inwards\u201d instead of making accusations against the BJP. \u201cWhy did Kalikho Pul in Arunachal Pradesh, who was with them for 21 years, leave the party? Why did a former CM and a former leader of opposition leave Congress in Uttarakhand. Was BJP to blame for the exit of people like Arjun Singh, Sharad Pawar, Babu Jagjivan Ram and Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Congress spokesperson Ajoy Kumar referred to a statement of the special public prosecutor in Malegaon case, in which she said she was asked to \u201cgo easy\u201d on the case. \u201cThe continuous compromise of NIA in all sensitive terror-related cases, be it the Best Bakery case or Malegaon blast case, would lead the country to a disastrous situation. So, all terror- related probes should be monitored by Supreme Court,\u201d he said. Kumar also demanded removal of NIA director Sharad Kumar.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2766364&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/parliament-bjp-congress-attack-uttarakhand-2766364/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/01/parliament-house-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/01/parliament-house-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Budget session</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/parliament-house.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">bjp, congress, parliament, bjp news, congress news, malegon bakery blast, uttarakhand, hindu terror, saffaron terror, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Corruption grafts its way to poll centre stage in West Bengal</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-polls-tmc-mamata-banerjee-elections-narada-tapes-bribery-sting-2766329/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-polls-tmc-mamata-banerjee-elections-narada-tapes-bribery-sting-2766329/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 01:50:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 01:50:14 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Esha Roy]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2766329</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Fierce rebuttals to veiled admission \u2014 signals from the ground force change in the Trinamool narrative <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2766329&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2747647 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mamata-tmc-rally-759.jpg\" alt=\"mamata banerjee, west bengal\" /> While analysts say the TMC still has a strong base in both rural and urban Bengal, Mamata\u2019s changing statements have shown an increasingly nervous Chief Minister, and party.\n<p>Upstaging the Chief Minister\u2019s pet themes of development and \u201cunnayon\u2019\u2019 (progress), corruption has emerged as the most important issue in the West Bengal Assembly elections. This could well be a first \u2014 corruption has never been an election issue in the state before \u2014 and ironically under a politician who shot to national fame due to her feisty opposition, and gradual subjugation, of the Left Front, but also in part due to her simplicity.</p>\n<p>As the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>-Left Front alliance and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> used the recently released Narada sting tapes to mount pressure on the Trinamool Congress (TMC), Mamata Banerjee\u2019s poll platform began shifting, from virulent attack on the Opposition by calling the sting a political conspiracy to the desperate pleas to voters to \u201cforgive\u201d her for \u201cany mistake\u201d.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/bengal-alliance-will-not-have-impact-on-kerala-poll-cpim-2796447/\">Bengal alliance will not have impact on Kerala poll: CPI(M)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-elections-cooch-behar-polls-over-ex-enclave-dwellers-wait-for-ration-cards-rice-2794201/\">Cooch Behar: Polls over, former enclave dwellers wait for ration cards, rice</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/west-bengal-elections-over-threats-and-violence-continue-2790839/\">West Bengal elections over, threats and violence continue</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-polls-end-congress-tmc-cpm-2788439/\">End of West Bengal polls: They broke enough sweat, now ready with the break</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/west-bengal-elections-2016-trinamool-congress-cpim-congress-bjp-2787589/\">West Bengal Elections: If TMC wins, it will face strongest opposition in decades</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>While analysts say the TMC still has a strong base in both rural and urban Bengal, Mamata\u2019s changing statements have shown an increasingly nervous Chief Minister, and party. Soon after the Narada tapes on March 14 purportedly showed 11 senior TMC leaders accepting wads of cash, the party rubbished the tapes. Newly reinstated TMC as vice-president, Mukul Roy called the tapes \u201cdoctored\u201d and a \u201cpolitical conspiracy\u201d.</p>\n<p>Days before, Mamata had kicked off her campaign from Malda, a traditional Congress bastion. She took on the Congress-CPI(M) coalition, calling it opportunistic. There was not a word on Narada.</p>\n<p>At Manbazar, Purulia, on March 29, she zoomed in on development, bringing peace to Jangalmahal, and her pet schemes \u2014 sabuj saathi (bicycles given to girl students) and Kanyashree (monetary aid for families educating girl children). Neither Narada nor Saradha, a chit fund scam that had broken earlier, wiping out life\u2019s savings of thousands.</p>\n<p>At a rally attended by thousands in Kharagpur just days before that Manbazar mass meeting, Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> brought corruption to the centre stage, tying Saradha inexorably to Narada. \u201cThis is the parivartan (change) that Didi has brought: Saradha se Narada tak (from Saradha to Narada),\u2019\u2019 he thundered.</p>\n<p>Modi wasn\u2019t off the mark \u2014 most TMC leaders shown allegedly taking money in the Narada tapes have been named in the Saradha chit fund scam as well. For many, the Narada tapes were a visual confirmation of the corruption that has taken hold of TMC.</p>\n<p>On March 31, an under-construction flyover in Burrabazar collapsed, killing 27 people. From under the debris arose allegations that material supplied for its construction came from a relative of the local MLA, Trinamool\u2019s Smita Bakshi. It brought into focus the alleged \u201cSyndicate Raj\u201d \u2014 gangs of TMC henchmen who control construction and development in and around Kolkata.</p>\n<p>The series of events, along with a mounting Opposition attack, finally appeared to crack a till-then-impassive Mamata. At a public meeting in Kulti on April 8, she admitted that all may not be well: \u201cI am at fault. I am taking responsibility for all errors. You can be angry with me, but do not deprive Trinamool Congress of your blessings. Otherwise it will be difficult for me to move ahead.\u201d Two days later, TMC finally ordered an internal probe into the Narada charges.</p>\n<p>A week later, on April 17, the CM made a startling admission at Bowbazar, in the heart of Kolkata. \u201cAn illegal company had done this (carry out the sting operation shown by Narada) in 2014. Why bring this up now? Had it been earlier, I would have thought about it. Nothing can be done now. I cannot change candidates after announcing their names,\u201d Mamata said.</p>\n<p>Two days later, Mukul Roy, who also featured in the tapes, said in Bardhaman that money had been taken, though not for personal reasons but for the party.</p>\n<p>From a brazen snub to fierce rebuttals to this veiled admission of corruption \u2014 this is what Opposition parties now see as a possible turning point in the election. All, they contend, cannot be well in the ruling party, as well as on ground, if the Chief Minister has had to come this far. The Trinamool\u2019s main strongholds \u2014 Howrah, Hooghly, North and South 24 Paraganas districts \u2014 meanwhile go to polls in the next two phases.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2766329&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-polls-tmc-mamata-banerjee-elections-narada-tapes-bribery-sting-2766329/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mamata-tmc-rally-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mamata-tmc-rally-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee during an election rally</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/mamata-tmc-rally-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">mamata banerjee, west bengal</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>\u2018Tide has changed, vote TMC if you want to live, they told us\u2019</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-tmc-cpm-bardhaman-politics-2766312/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-tmc-cpm-bardhaman-politics-2766312/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 01:42:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 01:42:09 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Aniruddha Ghosal]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2766312</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA['My family was threatened because we were involved in Left politics from the beginning.'<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2766312&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2766321 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/lodhna-wb-polls-759-2.jpg\" alt=\"West Bengal TMC, Left, TMC West Bengal, Bardhaman, Lodhna, Bardhaman TMC, Bardhaman CPM, CPM.

Since 2011, we haven\u2019t been able to retaliate&#8230; haven\u2019t even been able to slap a Trinamool worker on the face. But after the switch happened, we were outnumbered and have been fearing for our lives since then,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>He claimed he was attacked in March by a number of \u201cTrinamool goons\u201d, who pinned him to the ground while repeatedly striking him. \u201cThey didn\u2019t let me go until they were sure that I was seriously injured. I had a broken rib and the doctors later said that I had a spine injury as well,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Trinamool block president Alok Majhi, who is also the party candidate for Galsi seat in the district, denied the charges.</p>\n<p>When contacted, Deputy Superintendent D Bhattacharya said: \u201cWe are looking into all the allegations.

The other nominees are Malayalam actor Suresh Gopi, journalist Swapan Dasgupta and boxer Mary Kom.</p>\n<p>There were a total of seven vacancies, but the government filled six of them. The seventh nominee, held up at the eleventh hour, will be named soon. Those whose names are doing the rounds include film actor and vocal saffron activist Anupam Kher and TV personality and long-standing party sympathiser Rajat Sharma.</p>\n<p>The names of the new nominees were disclosed by a Home Ministry spokesperson, who said a formal notification would be issued shortly. The nominations are designed to bring people associated with literature, science, sports, films, media, art and social service to the Upper House.</p>\n<p>President Pranab Mukherjee nominated the six personalities from different fields to the House of Elders following a recommendation of the Narendra Modi government, a Home Ministry spokesperson said.</p>\n<p><strong>A look at the six personalities nominated to the Upper House:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Navjot Singh Sidhu, 52</em></p>\n<p>A cricketer-turned-politician, the Jat Sikh was a prize catch for the Hindutva-driven BJP in a communally sensitive Punjab. More so, because he happened to be immensely popular even among Sikh masses, notwithstanding the BJP tag. However, he has been sulking ever since he was denied a renomination from Amritsar Lok Sabha constituency \u2014 to facilitate allocation of the party ticket to <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/arun-jaitley/\">Arun Jaitley</a> \u2014 despite being a two-time MP. His MLA wife, also named Navjot, too had an uneasy equation with the Akali Dal. Sidhu\u2019s name had been in circulation as a possible Aam Aadmi Party choice for chief ministership, which many in the BJP feared could be a game-changer in the next Assembly elections. His nomination to the Upper House forecloses that possibility.</p>\n<p><em>Subramanian Swamy, 76</em></p>\n<p>He was first elected to the Rajya Sabha way back in 1974 on a Jana Sangh ticket. Young, bright, articulate and Harvard-educated, he was then seen as prime minister material within the Sangh Parivar, much to the discomfort of the other in-house aspirant, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. His career track might have been drastically different had he been a little more patient and stayed on with the BJP. However, he chose to go along the Janata parivar and ended up leading one faction. He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1977, 1980 and 1988, and to the Rajya Sabha in 1998. He was a minister in the Chandra Shekhar government. A relentless crusader, he forced the Ramakrishna Hegde government in Karnataka to resign on the issue of phone-tapping and later toppled the Vajpayee government by bringing the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> and J Jayalalithaa together in 1998. He was one of the petitioners in the 2G spectrum case, which led to the decline of the Congress. He is currently pursuing the National Herald case against <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/\">Sonia Gandhi</a> and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a>. Swamy joined the BJP in 2013 with strong backing from the RSS, despite opposition from a section of the party. He is unlikely to be content with a Rajya Sabha seat and may ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a Cabinet berth.</p>\n<p><em>Narendra Jadhav, 63</em></p>\n<p>The economist with a PhD degree in economics from Indiana University, USA, is a former vice-chancellor of Pune University. His nomination comes as a surprise, given his close association with former prime minister Manmohan Singh. He was a member of the Planning Commission (2009-14) and National Advisory Council (NAC) \u2014 headed by Sonia Gandhi \u2014 between 2010 and 2014, due to his proximity to the Congress leadership. He is learnt to have, of late, managed to get closer to PM Modi as well. A Dalit from Maharashtra, he has written some three dozen books in English, Hindi and Marathi, including a biography of B R Ambedkar.</p>\n<p><em>Swapan Dasgupta, 60</em></p>\n<p>The journalist and commentator has worked in senior editorial positions in various publications, including India Today, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a> and The Times of India. A gifted writer, he has consistently supported the Sangh Parivar and defended Modi in his regular columns in newspapers and on TV channels over the years. He is a recipient of the Padma Bhushan. Dasgupta accompanied BJP leader L K Advani on his \u201crath\u201d throughout his Bharat Uday Yatra from Kanyakumari to Amritsar in 2004 in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls. He shouldered the same responsibility with <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rajnath-singh/\">Rajnath Singh</a> when he undertook the Bharat Suraksha Yatra from Puri to Delhi in 2006. Like Swamy and Sidhu, Dasgupta would add to the BJP firing capacity in the Upper House.</p>\n<p><em>Mary Kom, 33</em></p>\n<p>An Olympic bronze medallist in boxing, Mangte Chungneijang Mary Kom belongs to the Sino-Tibetan speaking Kom tribe of Manipur. A five-time World Amateur Boxing champion, and the only woman boxer to have won a medal in each one of the six world championships, she became the first Indian woman boxer to get a gold medal in the Asian Games in 2014 in Incheon, South Korea. The BJP-led government has picked her for the Upper House to provide representation to the north-eastern states and send a positive signal to the sizeable Christian population in the region. Mary has published an autobiography, Unbreakable, co-authored by Dina Serto.</p>\n<p><em>Suresh Gopinath, 56</em></p>\n<p>Popular Malayalam actor Gopi holds a Masters\u2019 degree in English. With over 200 films to his credit, he has also been the host of a popular TV show Ningalkkum Aakaam Kodeeshwaran (You Can Be A Millionaire). He is a winner of the National Film Award and Filmfare Award. His nomination is intended to provide representation to south India. Belonging to the upper-case Nair community, Gopi is currently a star campaigner for BJP in Kerala Assembly polls. His nomination is expected to go down well with members of his community and help the BJP spread its wings in the state. Kerala is already abuzz with rumours that it may be just the first step towards his induction into the Modi ministry as a minister of state.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2765998&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/subramanian-swamy-navjot-singh-sidhu-swapan-dasgupta-nominated-for-rajya-sabha/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/page13.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/page13.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">page1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/page5.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">page</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>CPM leader VS Achuthanandan says list of CPM candidates not perfect, there are differences</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/achuthanandan-ldf-kerala-assembly-poll-cpm-candidates-2766292/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/achuthanandan-ldf-kerala-assembly-poll-cpm-candidates-2766292/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 01:26:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 12:39:28 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Shaju Philip]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2766292</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Achuthanandan predicts 100 seats for the LDF and says \u2018people want me to be CM but everything has to be decided by the party leadership\u2019<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2766292&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2766303 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/achuthanandan-7591.jpg\" alt=\"Achuthanandan-759\" /> CPM leader V S Achuthanandan\n<p><em>At 92, veteran CPM leader V S Achuthanandan is the face of the LDF campaign.

Achuthanandan does not have a personal opinion on this.</p>\n<p><strong>In the last election, you created a wave\u00a0by raising issues of the sex mafia and\u00a0sex rackets. What are planning this time?</strong></p>\n<p>The corruption within the Oommen Chandy government. So far, Chandy has used his officials as a cover and has become arrogant despite these corruption charges. Chandy is under the impression that he can get away with corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>LDF\u2019s critics say that you could not make any convincing case against Chandy in the solar scam, that the Opposition were merely repeating Saritha Nair\u2019s allegations.</strong></p>\n<p>We have been demanding that Chandy should answer the issues raised by Saritha, that alone is enough. She had stated that Chandy had taken the money from her solar firm. Also, investors deposited their money with her firm only after Chandy convinced them their money would be safe.

Soon, he is flooded with requests for selfies.</p>\n<p>But for many \u2014 especially the extremely political voters in Kerala \u2014 the debutant politician is still an outlier. \u201cI often ask for their blessings. I felt hesitant, initially, to ask them to vote for me. But I have been told I should ask that \u2014 even my party has told me (that) seeking votes is very important,\u201d Sreeshant says, waving from his at people on the roadsides.</p>\n<p>Politics, he says, became an option for two reasons. First, the persuasion of his father-in-law, a <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> supporter. Second, the long wait to get a clearance from the spot-fixing charges made against him in the 2013 IPL season. The initial suggestion was to fight from Madhya Pradesh, but Sreeshanth wanted to try a more familiar pitch, his home state.</p>\n<p>Did he prepare to become a full-fledged politician? \u201cYes,\u201d he admits sheepishly. \u201cI started listening to Modiji\u2019s speeches.. I also started reading <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/abdul-kalam/\">Abdul Kalam</a>-sahab\u2019s books.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to him, Modi\u2019s \u201clife story\u201d \u2014 that \u201canyone with normal opportunity but sheer hard work and passion\u201d can become India\u2019s Prime Minister \u2014 inspired him to join the BJP in a state where the party is yet to open its account. The campaign trail, he says, has helped him \u201cdiscover that every youngster is a Modi fan.\u201d But between the lines he mouths one can read that the cricketer in him is aware that it\u2019s a tough game. \u201cMany think the BJP is a religious party,\u201d he says, adding that the party will work hard to remove that notion.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will take time, but people are changing. Those who were divided between the LDF and the UDF (have now) started thinking BJP&#8230;they are swinging towards the BJP,\u201d he says. He is persistent, too. In Vallakadavu ward, where the BJP won only 37 votes in the civic elections, Sreesanth has been gone back again and again \u2014 like the tireless bowler he once was, returning to the top of his run-up after each delivery, good or bad. He now expects to get at least 50,000 votes from there.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2766255&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/sreesanth-kerala-bjp-thiruvananthapuram-central-2766255/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/sreesanth-kerala-bjp-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/sreesanth-kerala-bjp-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">SREESANTH-Kerala-BJP-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/sreesanth-kerala-bjp-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Sreesanth, BJP, Kerala, elections, Sreesanth BJP, Sreesanth Kerala BJP, Sreesanth Kerala elections, Sreesanth BJP Kerala, BJP KErala elections, BJP news, Kerala news, India news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Respect court&#8217;s decision, but instability is hampering state: Harish Rawat</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/harish-rawat-uttarahand-president-rule-congress-2765948/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/harish-rawat-uttarahand-president-rule-congress-2765948/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 00:36:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 00:38:33 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Devyani Onial]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2765948</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Harish Rawat  said that the Supreme Court stay order hasn't dampened the Congress's morale.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2765948&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2765952 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/harish-rawat2.jpg\" alt=\"harish rawat, uttarakhand crisis, harish rawar uttarakhand\" /> Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat with State <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> incharge Ambika Soni and Sanjay Kapoor (2R) during a meeting in Dehradun on Friday.

(Source: PTI)\n<p>&#8220;This is an emergency situation for the party, the state and democracy. These kind of challenges don&#8217;t come every day. What happened in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand should just stop here,&#8221; said Ambika Soni, the senior <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> leader in charge of Uttarakhand who arrived in Dehradun on Friday.</p>\n<p>Soni met Chief Minister Harish Rawat and other MLAs over lunch and will be in Dehradun until Saturday evening after the Uttarakhand High Court gives its verdict on the nine rebel Congress MLAs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am carrying a message from <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/\">Sonia Gandhi</a> to congratulate the party MLAs and leaders who came together in such a way,&#8221; she said. On how the Congress aims to keep its flock together till the floor test on April 29, Soni was quick to retort, &#8220;We were not the ones who took people on flights and made them stay in a five-star hotel in Haryana. Our MLAs were all working in their areas and have now come to Dehradun.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Expressing confidence on proving their majority, Soni said, &#8220;April 29 ko doodh ka doodh or paani ka paani ho jayega (Everything will become clear on April 29). I heard Kailash Vijayvargiya (<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> general secretary) on TV saying they don&#8217;t consider the court decision as anything and that they were in a majority and will make their government. Now we all know that in a house of 70 and one is nominated and one is their rebel MLA, so how will their 27 MLAs make a majority jab tak khareed farod nahin hogi (unless there is horse trading)?&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the BJP&#8217;s opposition to Rawat chairing cabinet meetings after he was reinstated as CM, Soni asked why the Centre has gone to the Supreme Court if the High Court&#8217;s oral order doesn&#8217;t stand. &#8220;Their legal team is weak. That is what Subramanian Swamy is crying about and for the first time he is speaking the truth,&#8221; said Soni.</p>\n<p>All prepared to raise the Uttarakhand issue in the upcoming session of Parliament, Soni said, &#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s the Opposition&#8217;s prime duty to expose a government that has no faith in democracy or the Constitution.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2765781&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/ambika-soni-uttarakhand-crisis-floor-test-presidents-rule-2765781/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/ambika-soni2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/ambika-soni2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">ambika soni2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ambika-soni1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">ambika soni, congress ,uttarakhand crisis</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Sidelined Sidhu set to regain footing in Punjab through RS nomination</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/navjot-singh-sidhu-rajya-sabha-nomination-punjab-amritsar-bjp-2766086/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/navjot-singh-sidhu-rajya-sabha-nomination-punjab-amritsar-bjp-2766086/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 21:52:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 21:53:09 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Man Aman Singh Chhina]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2766086</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Navjot Sidhu has kept away from Amritsar, apart from making a few low key visits, ever since the 2014 general elections.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2766086&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2590388 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/sidhu-759.jpg\" alt=\"Navjot Singh Sidhu, BJP, BJP SAD, BJP SAD allies, chandigarh news\" /> Navjot Singh Sidhu has kept away from Amritsar, apart from making a few low key visits, ever since the 2014 general elections.\n<p>Veteran cricketer and three time Amritsar MP, Navjot Sidhu seems to be heading towards rehabilitation within the Punjab unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>) after the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a>-led government nominated him to the Rajya Sabha.</p>\n<p>Sidhu has been on the sidelines of Punjab politics as well as the state BJP for a long time now and his antagonism with the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and its senior leadership resulted in him not getting a Rajya Sabha seat from the state. He and his wife have openly spoken about the deliberate manner in which development works in Amritsar <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> constituency were delayed and hampered during his term as the MP and they have squarely blamed the Akalis for trying to push Sidhu out of Amritsar.</p>\n<p>Navjot Sidhu has kept away from Amritsar, apart from making a few low key visits, ever since the 2014 general elections when <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/arun-jaitley/\">Arun Jaitley</a> was given the ticket from the city and he lost by a huge margin of over one lakh votes to Capt Amarinder Singh. Sidhu had taken a calculated decision to stay away from the constituency and did not campaign for Jaitley. His relations had also been less than cordial with the faction of BJP which was calling the shots at the time.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/navjot-singh-sidhu-rajya-sabha-nomination-punjab-amritsar-bjp-2766086/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/navjot-singh-sidhu-will-not-campaign-as-long-as-bjp-and-sad-are-allies/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/sidhu-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Navjot Singh Sidhu will not campaign as long as BJP and SAD are allies</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sidhu-all-over-just-not-here/\"><span class=\"text\">Sidhu all over,just not here</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/sidhu-out-of-political-coma-slams-aviation-minister-for-turning-down-requests-for-flights-to-amritsar/\"><span class=\"text\">Sidhu out of political coma,slams aviation minister for turning down requests for flights to Amritsar</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/latest-news/sidhu-out-of-political-coma-slams-aviation-minister-for-turning-down-his-requests-for-amritsar-airport/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/04/m_id_379619_sidhu.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Sidhu out of political coma,slams Aviation Minister for turning down his requests for Amritsar airport</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/sidhu-seeks-ticket-for-wife-high-command-fears-nepotism/\"><span class=\"text\">Sidhu seeks ticket for wife,high command fears nepotism</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/words-run-out-in-tight-corner-sidhu-promises-hes-all-action/\"><span class=\"text\">Words run out,in tight corner,Sidhu promises he\u0092s all action</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The local leadership of BJP in Punjab too had not been warm towards Sidhu, who , though sidelined in the state, had been used extensively by his party to campaign in Haryana during the assembly elections. At that time too he had taken on the Akalis in his speeches creating an embarrassment for BJP and SAD. With the change in guard in Punjab and Kamal Sharma handing over the presidentship of the state unit to Vijay Sampla, the atmosphere for Sidhu is likely to improve. An indication of the antagonism for Navjot Sidhu within state BJP could be gauged by the fact that when a senior state leader was asked about his proposed nomination to Rajya Sabha, he tried to downplay it by saying that nothing was official about it as yet.</p>\n<p>With Sidhu having remained silent over Punjab politics for more than a year now, it was his wife, Navjot Kaur Sidhi, the MLA from Amritsar (East) who has been taking on Akalis single-handedly. On April 1, she announced her resignation from BJP but later backed off among claims that she had been mollified by the central leadership of the party. And though members of her camp gave out feelers about Navjot Sidhu getting a Rajya Sabha nomination, she has did not make any comment on the development.</p>\n<p>The leadership within the state BJP feel that given the reports of Sidhu being wooed by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the move to retain him with the nomination to the upper house of parliament was a good move.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While it makes sense to retain him in the party, I am not sure how much dividend will his presence pay in the 2017 assembly elections given that his virulently anti-Akali stance is well know. However, it is better to have him on our side than to have him opposing us where he could do more damage,\u201d said a senior leader not willing to be named.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2766086&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/navjot-singh-sidhu-rajya-sabha-nomination-punjab-amritsar-bjp-2766086/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/sidhu-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/sidhu-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">sidhu-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/sidhu-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Navjot Singh Sidhu, BJP, BJP SAD, BJP SAD allies, chandigarh news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Will follow SC order with due respect: Harish Rawat on President&#8217;s Rule</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/harish-rawat-presidents-rule-supreme-court-uttarakhand-2765843/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/harish-rawat-presidents-rule-supreme-court-uttarakhand-2765843/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 18:19:47 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 18:24:44 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2765843</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya accused Rawat of taking over as the chief minister on Thursday without seeking permission from the governor.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2765843&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2764041\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/harish-rawat-759.jpg\" alt=\"Dehradun: Former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat addressing a press conference in Dehradun on Wednesday.

The general impression is that the election is neck and neck. What makes you so confident?</strong></p>\n<p>Our expectation is that we will get more than 100 seats. People are losing their faith in the UDF in a big way. Even those who stood by the UDF have given up on them \u2014 farmers, workers \u2014 because life has become miserable for them and they have identified that the UDF is the reason. It will reflect in voting.</p>\n<p><strong>Despite his slim majority and all the controversies, CM Oommen Chandy has completed his tenure. Is it because of caste-religion equations in the state?</strong></p>\n<p>No. It shows the degeneration in the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>. No party would let such a person continue in the CM\u2019s post. Such is the degeneration in the party that it could not take a decision on a person like him. He has taken advantage of the Congress\u2019s helplessness .</p>\n<p><strong>The CPM has launched a statewide publicity blitzkrieg with the tagline \u201cLDF will set everything right\u201d. Isn\u2019t that a break from tradition for your party?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, all political parties want to make their campaign more attractive. New campaign tools can influence voters a lot. As most people have mobile phones, it\u2019s a way to reach out to them. The train is a wonderful campaign tool, so we decided to use it, and the response has been very good. The Communist Party always adopted new tools to reach out. Earlier we used to use megaphones, which later became loudspeakers \u2014first on cycles and then on four-wheelers. Some time back, wall graffiti was all about writing a candidate\u2019s name with chalk. Then it was made more attractive, people started using boards and now there are flex-boards.</p>\n<p>tag-post limit=5 showtext=&#8221;Read More&#8221; tag=&#8221;Kerala Assembly elections 2016&#8243;]</p>\n<p><strong>What changes would you want to bring if the LDF wins?</strong></p>\n<p>Kerala need a comprehensive change \u2013 it cannot be confined to one sector. Development should be based on social justice and equality, development has to touch people and different sectors. Some sections in society need more care. The disabled or the mentally ill who are abandoned have so far been taken care of by some NGOs. The government should take care of them. Again, Kerala\u2019s uniqueness is its natural beauty. We have to have development that doesn\u2019t damage this beauty. Now water, water sources, and even nature itself are under the threat of pollution. This has to be taken care of.</p>\n<p><strong>Which one issue will you tackle first?</strong></p>\n<p>The prices of essential commodities. We will fix the prices of some commodities and these will remain the same for all five years.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it true that a section in your party feels the UDF\u2019s development plan is more attractive than the CPM\u2019s?</strong></p>\n<p>The UDF has no development. The four things it highlights are Kochi Metro, Vizhinjam project, Kannur airport and Smart City. All these were initiated by the LDF and had the LDF been in power, all of them would have been completed by now. The Metro is not running in Kochi because of the UDF\u2019s mismanagement. Flights would have been landing in Kannur had we been in power.</p>\n<p><strong>The CPM has this time seen protests over seat distribution. Doesn\u2019t it show indiscipline in the party cadre, which you led till a few months ago?</strong></p>\n<p>There has been no protest against the stance taken by the party on general issues. It is true that there have been some differences on some decisions by the leadership, but those weren\u2019t against the leadership, they reflected local sentiments. The final decision has been the leadership\u2019s. Mostly those protests came from those who had kept themselves away from the party for sometime. They would take stances defying the leadership. These will be known as protests in and by the CPM; in fact, they are not CPM. It doesn\u2019t affect the party, nor it is internal.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is the CPM\u2019s chief ministerial candidate? Looking at the posters, one would feel it is Pinarayi Vijayan.</strong></p>\n<p>That is not correct. We have not thought about a chief ministerial candidate. If we get a majority, the party will think about it and take a decision.</p>\n<p><strong>Posters show you, V S Achuthanandan and Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. Is VS just one of the candidates or a special candidate?</strong></p>\n<p>All of us are ordinary candidates. But the pictures are of those who lead the LDF\u2019s campaign. VS has an important role in leading the campaign, that\u2019s the reason his picture is there. Kodiyeri Balakrishan is the party secretary and I am there as a politburo member contesting the election. The posters should not be seen as sending any other message.</p>\n<p><strong>Has factionalism in the party affected seat distribution? Not many Ezhavas got tickets. The Ezhavas have been a CPM vote base but they now have the BDJS. </strong></p>\n<p>That\u2019s not true. The CPM emphasises social justice but we do not distribute seats on the basis of caste. The BDJS has not taken any stand to protect Ezhavas\u2019 interests. A majority in the SNDP are eligible for reservation, but the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> and the RSS don\u2019t believe in reservation. Even PM <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> says reservation for SCs and STs will continue but he isn\u2019t sure about OBCs. By joining hands with such a party, the BDJS has cheated the Ezhavas.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you worried about a division in the Hindu vote because of the BJP?</strong></p>\n<p>No. The SNDP is a group that embraces the visions of Sree Narayana Guru, which is contrary to the RSS\u2019s view. The BJP can install statues of the guru but we are ready to take that challenge, they cannot hijack the guru. His vision and the RSS\u2019s cannot go together.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you propose to rid the CPM of the image that it opposes everything?</strong></p>\n<p>This is an image some people tried to put on the CPM. But we have always accepted new things. The Communist Party has had a publication since the beginning; here we have the newspaper Desabhimani, which is as important as other corporate newspapers. We have always incorporated changes in the communication revolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Will the CPM\u2019s understanding with the Congress in Bengal affect it in Kerala?</strong></p>\n<p>We have not entered into an alliance with the Congress. The Congress has weakened in West Bengal \u2014 they were out of power for decades and a majority of its members went to the Trinamool Congress. In the new circumstances, in which the TMC had demolished all democratic principles, there is a general sentiment against the state\u2019s ruling party. So our party wanted to take advantage of that sentiment. It is not a political alliance.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764766&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/pinarayi-vijayan-ldf-cpim-kerala-cm-candidate-2764766/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/pinarayi-vijayan-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/pinarayi-vijayan-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Pinarayi-Vijayan-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/pinarayi-vijayan-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kerala, kerala polls, kerala elections, ldf, ldf kerala, ldf cm candidate, kerala cpm, cpm kerala, kerala polls, kerala news, Pinarayi Vijayan, kerala cm candidates</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Narendra Modi says Mamata Banerjee has accepted defeat, Left-Congress alliance bogus</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/modi-mamata-left-congress-alliance-west-bengal-elections-2764569/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/modi-mamata-left-congress-alliance-west-bengal-elections-2764569/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 00:38:13 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 06:51:11 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2764569</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Modi also flayed the cooperation among the Trinamool, Left and Congress in the Rajya Sabha for stopping all development work.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764569&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2764574\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/modi11.jpg\" alt=\"North 24 Pargana: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses an election campaign rally at North 24 Pargana on Thursday.

It took away lives of so many innocent people,&#8221; he said adding, &#8220;Both Left and Trinamool are responsible for the flyover collapse as work had started during the former&#8217;s regime and supposed to get completed under the latter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Turning to the Left and Congress alliance, the PM ridiculed the combine and said &#8220;Earlier the Left used to say that the Congress was the cause of all ills in Bengal.

In UP, Bihar, Gujarat and MP, the Congress did not return after defeat.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pitching for the BJP in Bengal, Modi said the party&#8217;s track record was impressive and BJP got repeated mandates in states like MP, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh and Jharkhand.</p>\n<p>This, he said, was due to the developmental work done by the party in these states.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764569&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/modi-mamata-left-congress-alliance-west-bengal-elections-2764569/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/modi21.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/modi21.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Modi in North 24 Pargana</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/modi11.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">North 24 Pargana: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses an election campaign rally at North 24 Pargana on Thursday.

Vijayan was answering a question during an interaction with journalists.</p>\n<p>The resolution against Achuthanandan, Leader of the Opposition in Kerala, was taken in early 2015. The CPM state secretariat had resolved that Achuthanandan had stooped to the level of an anti-party activist. This was after Achuthanandan had sent a note to the central leadership questioning the state unit\u2019s stand on a number of contentious issues, including the murder of rebel leader T P Chandrasekharan. The CPM rejected Achuthanandan\u2019s stand on the ground that these issues had already been discussed and the party had taken a stand.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/railways-helps-clear-kolkata-flyover-debris-2767574/\">Railways helps clear Kolkata flyover debris</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kolkata-flyover-collapse-3-weeks-after-locals-hope-for-a-close-result-2764682/\">Where flyover crumbled in Kolkata, some reasons to vote and some not to</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/public-expenditure-budget-no-bottomless-kitty/\">No bottomless kitty</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-fact-what-an-act-of-god-is-isnt/\">In Fact: What an \u2018act of God\u2019 is, isn\u2019t</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/a-day-in-the-life-of-vinod-sonkar-fruit-vendor-near-vivekananda-flyover-collapse-site-in-kolkata/\">A day in the life of Vinod Sonkar, fruit vendor near the flyover collapse site in Kolkata</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Vijayan said a party resolution is not meant to be abandoned at any time. At the same time, he said Achuthanandan\u2019s candidature should not be linked to the resolution. Achuthanandan is contesting the elections because the CPM has taken the decision, not Achuthanandan, Vijayan said.</p>\n<p>Although Vijayan and Achuthanandan have been at loggerheads for years, they had appeared to have ceased attacking each other for the past several months. Vijayan\u2019s comment now comes a day before Achuthanandan is due to address an election meeting in Dharmadam, where Vijayan is the CPM candidate.</p>\n<p>On another subject, Vijayan said the CPM\u2019s liquor policy would be decided only after the party comes to power. The party is against a ban on liquor, he said. Asked about party general secretary Sitaram Yechury\u2019s comment that the party would not open liquor bars that have been closed, Vijayan said such opinions would be discussed after the elections.<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2762857&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/vs-achuthanandan-anti-party-resolution-stands-cpm-vijayan-2762857/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/achuthanandan-vijayan-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/achuthanandan-vijayan-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Achuthanandan Vijayan 480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/achuthanandan-vijayan-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Achuthanandan, Achuthanandan CPM, Achuthanandan anti CPM, CPM Kerala, kerala elections, Achuthanandan Kerala elections, Kerala news, India news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Educationist and former ministers\u2019 kin line up against Jayalalithaa</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/tamil-nadu-jayalalithaa-aiadmk-vck-dmk-bjp-2762839/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/tamil-nadu-jayalalithaa-aiadmk-vck-dmk-bjp-2762839/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 01:57:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 08:58:09 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Arun Janardhanan]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2762839</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[At least three of the candidates are also women\u2019s activists.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2762839&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2762843 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/vasanthi-759.jpg\" alt=\"Tamil Nadu Assembly Elections 2016, Tamil Nadu Elections, J Jayalalithaa, TN Chief minister Jayalalithaa, tamil nadu, tamil nadu polls, tamil nadu elections, vaiko, vck, dmk, bjp, aiadmk, tamil nadu candidates, India news, Tamil Nadu election news, Tamil Nadu news\" /> Vasanthi Devi,\u00a0Educationist, VCK\n<p>A leading educationist is the Vijayakanth-Vaiko front\u2019s candidate against Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa in R K Nagar, joining a line-up that includes the son-in-law of a former minister and the daughter-in-law of another.

Later that night, he issued a statement reiterating the stand. \u201cDoctored or manufactured video, that we still do not know. I know all these colleagues for a long time. They are not the kind of people who would take money for personal gain,\u201d Roy said.</p>\n<p>The expression of faith in the 11 people shot on hidden cameras \u2014 Roy himself is one of the six MPs featured and the only one who is not facing the parliamentary ethics committee being a member of the Rajya Sabha \u2014 has stuck a wrong note given that Mamata\u2019s stance on the same issue had been that these were acts of personal transgression with no connection to the party.</p>\n<p>The opposition has pounced on Roy\u2019s statement. The ramifications are more likely to be felt within than without,<br />\nhowever, given that Roy is yet to be accorded the stature that he once had in the party, until the Saradha scam unfolded. Roy, who was the national general secretary of the party, leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha and also the leader of the Trinamool parliamentary party, has not got back any of those posts and continues to sit in the last row of the Rajya Sabha where he had been relegated after he became the sole Trinamool leader to be called by the CBI in the chit fund scam and not taken into custody.</p>\n<p>The alienation from Mamata had been rapid and absolute with the two studiously avoiding being even in the same city, before they mended bridges last December over dinner at the Delhi home of Mamata\u2019s nephew Abhishek Banerjee, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> MP. Until then, Roy had been seen as the key mover \u2014 behind the scenes \u2014 in the launch of a new political party that eventually did not take off; the repatriation is believed to have been to scuttle exactly that.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of Roy\u2019s alienation, though, a new crop of leaders have emerged as the party\u2019s faces in Delhi, with Derek O\u2019Brien leading it in the Rajya Sabha and also a new set of media spokespeople for the party including Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar (national secretary and one of the MPs in the sting now at the crosshairs of the ethics committee) in the Lok Sabha and Nadimul Haq in the Rajya Sabha.</p>\n<p>Sources say even before Roy\u2019s \u201copen act of defiance\u201d, there was tension between the two. The Trinamool chief did not take kindly to the removal of Kolkata police commissioner Rajiv Kumar at the behest of the Election Commission and viewed it as Roy\u2019s failure to swing the EC\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2762824&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/mamata-banerjee-mukul-roy-tmc-sting-2762824/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mamata-mukul-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mamata-mukul-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">MAMATA-MUKUL-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/mamata-mukul-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Mamata Banerjee, Mukul roy, TMC, TMC sting, narada sting, narada tmc sting, mamata banerjee tmc sting, mukul roy tmc sting, tmc news, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>In old Calcutta, it\u2019s Congress \u2018opportunist\u2019 vs TMC \u2018graft\u2019</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/kolkata-chowringhee-tmc-congress-somen-mitra-nayna-bandyopadhyay-2762812/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/kolkata-chowringhee-tmc-congress-somen-mitra-nayna-bandyopadhyay-2762812/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 01:39:28 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 01:39:28 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Aniruddha Ghosal]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2762812</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Recent trends would suggest Nayna\u2019s party is better placed than Mitra\u2019s.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2762812&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2762819 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mitra-nayna-759.jpg\" alt=\"Kolkata, Kolkata voting, Chowringhee, old calcutta, congress kolkata, tmc kolkata , kolkata news, bengal news, bengal election news, india news\" /> Chowringhee chooses between Mitra and Nayna today.\n<p>For three centuries, Chowringhee has epitomised the aura of importance surrounding Calcutta.

Murshidabad and Burdwan have often been described as Bengal\u2019s killing fields because of their history of political violence through decades.</p>\n<p>What eclipses everything else this round, however, are the Narada sting videos and the Vivekananda flyover collapse. Top Trinamool <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> leaders confessed in private that these two events have changed the complexion of the contest and introduced an element of doubt to their minds, particularly in urban pockets.

The worst attacks in the past week came, however, not from the CPM but from Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> and Congress president <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/\">Sonia Gandhi</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cBengal is gripped by a vicious syndicate culture which is destroying everything. The cast of characters from Saradha to Narada to the flyover collapse are all the same,\u201d Modi said in Kolkata. A couple of days earlier, Sonia had attacked Mamata Banerjee for the first time, saying at a rally in Malda: \u201cMamata\u2019s government has committed dhoka with the people. She has been unmasked now.\u201d</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2762806 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/flyover-kolkata-759.jpg\" alt=\"Central forces in Jorasanko, site of flyover collapse. \" /> Central forces in Jorasanko, site of flyover collapse. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta)\n<p>Mamata has at times appeared uncharacteristically tentative in her response to these attacks, particularly as far as the sting is concerned. At one meeting, she said she would order a probe into the sting after the polls. At another, she said \u201cPardon me this time if you feel outraged at the revelations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two of the constituencies in this round are hot seats. One is Jorasanko, where the Vivekananda flyover collapsed killing 26, injuring more than 100 and displacing several thousand residents. Even without the flyover collapse, this assembly seat is one where <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> hopes runs high. In this segment of Kolkata Uttar, the BJP had led in 2014 with 45,000 votes to the 28,500 of the Trinamool Congress, while the Congress had polled 20,600 and the Left 15,400.</p>\n<p>All 11 seats combined in Kolkata, the BJP had a vote share of 27.29 per cent, behind the Trinamool\u2019s 35.60 per cent but ahead of the Left\u2019s 19.63 per cent and the Congress\u2019s 14.45. In Jorasanko, the BJP has fielded its former state president Rahul Sinha, one of the party\u2019s most familiar faces in Kolkata, against sitting MLA Smita Bakshi of the Trinamool Congress. The contest is triangular, with the Left-Congress combine seen as strong enough to divide the opposition vote.</p>\n<p>The other key constituency, also in north Kolkata, is Chowringhee where veteran Congress leader Somen Mitra is pitted against Nayna Bandopadhyay of the Trinamool Congress and Ritesh Tiwari of the BJP. Nayna, wife of MP Sudip Bandopadhyay, is the sitting MLA in this constituency, whose large business community and closeness to the collapsed Jorasanko flyover will keep BJP hopes ticking.</p>\n<p>All 22 seats in Baharampur are going to polls this round along with 17 in Nadia and 16 in Burdwan. The Congress-<br />\nLeft alliance has not worked out as smoothly in Murshidabad as state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury had hoped. In Burdwan, the communists are making a strong bid to regain some of the ground they have lost.</p>\n<p>Murshidabad is a Muslim-dominated district that Mamata had earlier left largely to the Congress as an alliance partner. This time she has assigned this Congress bastion to Suvendu Adhikari, Trinamool Congress MP. \u201cWe have worked hard in Murshidabad. Had the Congress-Left alliance not been there, the Trinamool would have had a better share of seats. Even now, we are sure to spring some surprises,\u201d Adhikari said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, the alliance did not work out as comprehensively on the ground as we had expected. I cannot rule out accidents in some seats,\u201d said Adhir, wary of upsets by the TMC.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2762796&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/kolkata-voting-bengal-elections-flyover-collapse-mamata-congress-cpm-2762796/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/polls-kolkata-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/polls-kolkata-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">polls-kolkata-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/polls-kolkata-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kolkata, kolkata voting, Kolkata polling, Kolkata votes, TMC, Congress, CPM, West bengal elections, bengal elections, bengal polls, bengal news, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/flyover-kolkata-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Central forces in Jorasanko, site of flyover collapse. </media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Vijayakanth slams DMK chief Karunanidhi for aspiring to be CM at 92</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/vijaykanth-karunanidhi-dmdk-dmk-tamil-nadu-elections-2762728/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/vijaykanth-karunanidhi-dmdk-dmk-tamil-nadu-elections-2762728/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 00:49:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 00:49:20 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2762728</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Vijaykanth also attacked AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa, saying though the ruling party had \"money power\", the DMDK-PWF combine had the support of people with \"strong hearts\".<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2762728&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2762772\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/vijaykanth1.jpg\" alt=\"Chengalpattu: DMDK leader Vijayakanth addresses the alliance conference for the upcoming Tamil Nadu assembly elections at Mamandur in Chengalpattu on Sunday.

(Express Photo by Subham Dutta)\n<p>No one plays the minority card in Domkol, whose 89.7 per cent Muslim population is the highest for any assembly constituency in the country. It has also been one of the most backward in Bengal, although Trinamool supporters would like to list what their government has done here in the last five years.</p>\n<p>About 40 km from Baharampur town in Murshidabad, its history tied with Murshid Kuli Khan, Nawab Sirajudullah and the British, Domkol has one more political identity. It has seen some of the worst political violence in Bengal, with over 100 <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> and CPM supporters killed over the years.</p>\n<p>Abdur Rahim Sheikh, Congress candidate, counts 17 killings during the 2008 panchayat polls, following 27 in 2003. The 2003 panchayat polls had witnessed 107 deaths in the state, 54 of these in Murshidabad and 27 of these, in turn, in Domkol. \u201cWe have a political martyr in every other Congress or CPM household,\u201d said Sheikh.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/bengal-alliance-will-not-have-impact-on-kerala-poll-cpim-2796447/\">Bengal alliance will not have impact on Kerala poll: CPI(M)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-elections-cooch-behar-polls-over-ex-enclave-dwellers-wait-for-ration-cards-rice-2794201/\">Cooch Behar: Polls over, former enclave dwellers wait for ration cards, rice</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/west-bengal-elections-over-threats-and-violence-continue-2790839/\">West Bengal elections over, threats and violence continue</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-polls-end-congress-tmc-cpm-2788439/\">End of West Bengal polls: They broke enough sweat, now ready with the break</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/west-bengal-elections-2016-trinamool-congress-cpim-congress-bjp-2787589/\">West Bengal Elections: If TMC wins, it will face strongest opposition in decades</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>So deep is the rivalry that this seat refused to go with the understanding between the Congress and the CPM. \u201cHow can we forgo our claim to this seat?\u201d says Sheikh. \u201cWe have most of the panchayat bodies under our control and we led by over 30,000 votes in this assembly segment in the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> polls. Add to that the history of bloodshed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Domkol\u2019s voting trends are consistent yet contradictory. The CPM has held the assembly seat for 39 years but in successive Lok Sabha polls, the Congress has been leading by huge margins in this segment. CPM MLA Anisur Rahman, the candidate once again, will be banking on the former trend. The former minister carries an image of being charming and accessible, always attending birthdays, festivals and emergencies.</p>\n<p>This time, however, one can hear voices questioning the lack of development during Left rule \u2014 not one government school or college in 39 years, no healthcare facility, no jobs. \u201cThousands migrate to other states, make some money and come back home, only to go back again. This has become the character of Domkol,\u201d said Parbati Shankar Nandy, secretary of the Domkol Babsayee Samiti, an influential local body that helps swing votes. In the last two or three elections, he worked with Rahman. This time, he is with Shoumik Hossain, TMC youth leader.</p>\n<p>Nandy said the Trinamool Congress government has done more in less than five years than the CPM did in more than 30 years. Domkol\u2019s first hostel for women has come up, besides the building for a superspeciality hospital. He listed more \u2014 the Rajiv Gandhi rural electrification programme has reached more homes, Domkol has become a municipality, small bridges have given connectivity to newer areas, a market complex is coming up at Rs 1.32 crore.</p>\n<p>The Domkol BDO, Tsewang Gyatso Bhutia, who hails from Darjeeling, admitted he is on difficult terrain in terms of weather and work. The government\u2019s cycle distribution programme was a big hit, he said, but those who did not get one blocked roads frequently in Domkol. \u201cThere are not enough artisans who could assemble the cycles. We hired artisans from Mumbai and Jharkhand before the polls and managed to distribute many but the target is yet to be met.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hossain, the TMC candidate, moves around with armed commandos who claim they were sent by the police because he is in a high-risk list in this violent constituency. Hossein is confident; he claims to have engineered mass defections from both the Congress and the CPM. \u201cThe entire Left vote machinery is with me now. If anyone wants to bet on one seat in Mushisdabad, it is here in Domkol for Trinamool Congress,\u201d he said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2761377&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-domkol-muslims-cpm-congress-tmc-2016-polls-2761377/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/domkol-cpm-bengal-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/domkol-cpm-bengal-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">DOMKOL-cpm-bengal-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/domkol-cpm-bengal-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">domkol, west bengal, bengal, bengal muslims, west bengal muslims, bengal muslim votes, west bengal muslim votes, cpm, congress, tmc, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>LDF pledges 25 lakh jobs in 5 years</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/cpm-ldf-manifesto-kerala-polls-2016-2761360/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/cpm-ldf-manifesto-kerala-polls-2016-2761360/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 02:11:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 02:11:32 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Shaju Philip]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2761360</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The manifesto, unveiled by LDF convener Vaikkom Vishwan Tuesday, is silent on opening liquor bars in Kerala. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2761360&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2735861 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/cpm_759.jpg\" alt=\"ldf, ldf kerala, ldf kerala 2016, kerala polls, kerala elections, kerala ldf, kerala ldf 2016, kerala news, india news\" /> CPIM workers paint a wall to campaign for LDF \u00a0in Kozhikode, Kerala (PTI photo)\n<p>A second edition of the \u201cpeople\u2019s planning\u201d initiative decentralising the process of development, 25 lakh jobs in five years and a huge mobilisation of funds from development agencies for infrastructure are among the major highlights of the election manifesto of the CPM-led Left Democratic Front in Kerala.</p>\n<p>The manifesto, unveiled by LDF convener Vaikkom Vishwan Tuesday, is silent on opening liquor bars in Kerala.

(Source: PTI Photo)\n<p>Continuing her tirade against DMK president M Karunanidhi over prohibition, AIADMK supremo and Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa on Monday charged him and his party with &#8220;conspiring&#8221; to sell liquor through private firms and clubs and underscored her commitment for a phased rollout of the dry law in Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p>Addressing an election rally in Chennai, she asked why DMK, despite staging many protests demanding total prohibition, just promised enacting a law to implement dry law while giving a miss to the word &#8220;total&#8221; in its recently released election manifesto.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is because Karunanidhi and DMK have no intention of bringing total prohibition. That is why they have said in their manifesto that a law will be enacted for this purpose while government will completely back away from selling liquor and TASMAC (Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation) will be disbanded.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/karunanidhi-alcohol-prohibition-tamil-nadu-jayalalithaa-2759411/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/dmdk-bjp-led-alliance-would-not-impact-my-partys-prospects-karunanidhi/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/karunanidhi-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">DMDK &amp; BJP led alliance would not impact my party&#039;s prospects: Karunanidhi</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/in-tamil-nadu-no-change-in-tradition-of-people-voting-for-the-winnable-party-2771350/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/aiadmk2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">In Tamil Nadu, no change in tradition of people voting for the winnable party</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/tamil-nadu-polls-karunanidhi-dmk-aiadmk-jayalalithaa-queens-rule/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/jaya2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Tamil Nadu campaign heats up: Jaya slams Kani for Tamil deaths in Lanka</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-2016-liquor-ban-tasmac-alcohol-prohibition-2760672/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/tasmac-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Prohibition: The one theme common to all parties in Tamil Nadu</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/tamil-nadu-polls-2016-no-big-freebies-in-dmk-manifesto-assures-dry-law-lokayukta/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/06/dmk.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Tamil Nadu polls: No big freebies in DMK manifesto, assures dry law, Lokayukta</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/jayalalithaa-tamil-nadu-elections-2016-aiadmk-liquor-prohibition-ban/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/jayalalithaa-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Tamil Nadu elections: Jayalalithaa promises phased prohibition if elected to power</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>&#8220;They have conspired to sell (liquor) through private (persons) and clubs,&#8221; she alleged, canvassing for votes for her party nominees of three districts for the May 16 Assembly elections.</p>\n<p>Accusing Karunanidhi of having &#8220;introduced alcohol to an entire generation&#8221; by relaxing the dry law in 1971, she<br />\nassured her commitment to implement total prohibition in the state, albeit in a phased manner, as promised already.</p>\n<p>She reiterated that bringing prohibition with one signature, as earlier promised by DMK, was not possible and that she will go about it by initially shrinking the working hours, cutting down on number of retail outlets and later closing bars while opening rehabilitation centres for addicts.</p>\n<p>Prohibition has taken the centre stage in this election campaign, with all political leaders including Jayalalithaa batting for the dry law.</p>\n<p>A major revenue grosser for the state exchequer at around Rs 30,000 crore last year, alcohol sales was first nationalised by the AIADMK government in 2003.</p>\n<p>The subsequent DMK government continued with that policy.

But when it comes to the question of alliances, they are state-specific. That\u2019s because a particular party, which has presence in one state, does not have much presence in the neighbouring states. So parties go for state-specific alliances,\u201d Ahmad said.</p>\n<p>He said some parties think they are competent to take on the BJP in their state and hence they don\u2019t go for alliances. \u201cSome, on the other hand, go for alliances. But essentially these are state-level alliances,\u201d he said. \u201cFor instance, there is a party in Bihar. What can we achieve by aligning with that party in Bengal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no talk of leadership (by Nitish)&#8230; By the time 2019 elections come, the public themselves will oust the Modi government and there will be no need for any alliance,\u201d he said at a party function when asked about the possibility of forging a Nitish-led alliance. Asked if Nitish was being pitted against <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a> in leading an alternative coalition, he said, \u201cThere is no fight amongst us. We are all together.\u201d</p>\n<p>The BJP on its part targeted Nitish for his remarks, saying that those criticising BJP should attend RSS shakha at least for a day to clear \u201cmisconceptions\u201d. BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma attacked Nitish\u2019s rule in Bihar, saying the state has returned to its \u201cjungle raj\u201d days. \u201cYou have had a long coalition with BJP. You have been participating in BJP programmes also. But you have called for a Sangh-free India. It is better you learn and understand the Sangh a little bit. And for that visiting the shakha of the Sangh is the best. Those who oppose RSS should first at least visit its shakha. Only then their misconceptions will be cleared,\u201d Sharma said.</p>\n<p>RSS ideologue M G Vaidya said, \u201cThey can\u2019t defeat the BJP on their own.

We are really fed up. There is no water in the summer, no roads. It is especially difficult for the young people. We are all educated here but there are no jobs. Everyone has to move out to Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune to find a job. I was a cook at a Chinese restaurant in Mumbai. I just left and came back and have now joined JAP. Why should I have to go to Mumbai to find a job?\u201d Thapa asks.</p>\n<p>Thapa sees hope in Chettri\u2019s demand for Kalimpong to be carved out as a separate district.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we will get the infrastructure. There will be government offices, hospitals and there will be jobs. The GJM has done nothing for us. They were corrupt and JAP is against corruption,\u201d he says, unmindful of the allegations of misappropriation of funds that Chettri faced. A GJM worker alleges that Chettri had used his MLA funds to erect a wall on his private property.</p>\n<p>Allegations aside, the 54-year-old MLA is considered a \u201cpolite, educated man\u201d. He was an assistant teacher of Biology at St George\u2019s Higher Secondary School in Pedong (Kalimpong) before he joined politics. A GJM candidate in 2011 elections, Chettri swept the polls by capturing 87.36 per cent of the total votes.</p>\n<p>With JAP as his identification now, Chettri has a toned-down take on the GJM\u2019s stand on Gorkhaland \u2014 a demand for a separate state for the people of Darjeeling and the Gorkhas of the Dooars.</p>\n<p>Chettri, however, quickly identifies himself with the movement even though he is no longer with the GJM. \u201cIn my election manifesto, you will find that the very first point is the demand for Gorkhaland. It is an extremely emotional issue for the people here and it is closer to my heart as well,\u201d he clarifies.</p>\n<p>Political analysts say that Chettri\u2019s move to split from the GJM was a \u201cmasterstroke by Mamata Banerjee\u201d, the chief minister and president of Trinamool <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>.</p>\n<p>As fissures developed between her and Gurung, Mamata quickly extended a hand towards Chettri.</p>\n<p>The JAP chief, however, denies having any \u201cunderstanding\u201d with the TMC.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she did tell me that she would not field a candidate here and support me instead. If I was given more time, I would have fielded candidates everywhere. For now, though, I will just have to take kalimpong,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Who will take Kalimpong will be decided on April 17 by the voters, who say that the town will see the \u201ctoughest fight\u201d in the hills \u2014 between Chettri and GJM\u2019s Sarita Rai.</p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755668&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-kalimpong-bahadur-chettri-bimal-gurung-2755668/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/chettri-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/chettri-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Chettri-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3817e56a0c650d46272f216e6488214c?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">monikatrivedi31</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/chettri-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Harka Bahadur Chettri, Kalimpong, West Bengal, Bimal Gurung, BEngal elections, Bengal polls, Bengal election news, TMC, BJP, India news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Gurung pins hopes on Gorkhaland, BJP on Gurung</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-polls-bimal-gurung-bjp-gorkhaland-2755664/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-polls-bimal-gurung-bjp-gorkhaland-2755664/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2016 02:22:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2016 02:22:52 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Esha Roy]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2755664</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Over the past year and a half, relations have soured between Gurung and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755664&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2755675 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/bimal-gurung-749.jpg\" alt=\"West Bengal, Bimal Gurung, BJP, Gorkhaland, BJP Gorkhaland, BJP in Bengal, Bengal BJP, BJP Bimal Gurung, Bimal Gurung BJP, India news\" /> Gurung in Kalimpong, Friday.

We are confident of winning these seats,\u2019\u2019 a Gurung aide said.</p>\n<p>Seated surrounded by supporters, Gurung said, \u201cWe are loyal to the BJP because it is the most sympathetic to our cause for a separate state for Gorkhas. This alliance will continue in future elections,\u201d said Gurung. \u201cWhen I met (PM Narendra) Modiji during his rally in Madarihat, we discussed many issues. We will work things out.\u201d The understanding is implicit: the BJP will make inroads into Bengal while Gurung will have a shot at Gorkhaland.</p>\n<p>Over the past year and a half, relations have soured between Gurung and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. \u201cShe interfered in GTA matters. There is a lot of resentment against her,\u2019\u2019 a GJM source said.</p>\n<p>In a run-up to the elections, Mamata announced development boards for communities in Darjeeling district such as the Lepcha Development Board and Tamang Development Board. These are separate from the GTA, which is responsible for governing Darjeeling district. While the Gorkhas are the dominant community here, Lepchas, Limpus, Tamangs, Bhutias, Rais, Dukpas, Sherpas and Tibetans also form a sizeable population.</p>\n<p>\u201cMamata is trying to divide the people of Gorkhaland on communal lines. I think we got the GTA by mistake \u2014 they didn\u2019t really understand the gravity of it. Ever since, she has been trying to break the identity of Gorkhaland. I am asking for my rights, and Gorkhaland is my right. She can form as many development boards as she wants, but these boards are also supporting us,\u2019\u2019 Gurung said. However, seeing the advantages of having their own boards, and thus a source of funding, some feel that these communities may consider moving away from the GJM. The shutting of tea estates will also cost Mamata, Gurung added.</p>\n<p>Party insiders said Mamata\u2019s move to derecognise Nepali as an official language had angered people. \u201cBesides, the schemes she talks about in her campaign have not entered the hills,\u201d said a GJM member.</p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755664&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/west-bengal-polls-bimal-gurung-bjp-gorkhaland-2755664/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/bimal-gurung-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/bimal-gurung-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Bimal-Gurung-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/bimal-gurung-749.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">West Bengal, Bimal Gurung, BJP, Gorkhaland, BJP Gorkhaland, BJP in Bengal, Bengal BJP, BJP Bimal Gurung, Bimal Gurung BJP, India news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Birbhum\u2019s strongman &#8212; Anubrata Mondal explains why he talks of bombs and candy</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/anubrata-mondal-birbhum-tmc-west-bengal-elections-2754174/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/anubrata-mondal-birbhum-tmc-west-bengal-elections-2754174/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 01:33:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 01:33:56 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Arshad Ali]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2754174</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Mondal has come under the scanner of the Election Commission after allegedly intimidating voters, which he denies. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2754174&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2754180 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mamata-ec-759.jpg\" alt=\"Anubrata Modal, Birbhum, TMC, Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal elections, West Bengla polls, Bengal polls, Birbhum rally, Birbhum Anubrata Mondal, Birbhum TMC, TMC news, India news\" /> Mamata with Anubrata Mondal, against whom the EC has initiated \u2018urgent legal action\u2019. (Express Photo by Arshad Ali)\n<p>Anubrata Mondal isn\u2019t contesting the elections. He isn\u2019t an MP, an MLA or even a councillor. Yet rivals allege that Mondal, as Trinamool <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> president in Birbhum, controls the entire district administration.</p>\n<p>Mondal has come under the scanner of the Election Commission after allegedly intimidating voters, which he denies. The EC said Thursday that it was initiating \u201curgent legal action\u201d against him following complaints by the Opposition, which has also demanded his arrest. On Tuesday, he had been censured for certain remarks against a woman <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> candidate.</p>\n<p>Reaching him can be no less an exercise than reaching a VVIP. On Wednesday, the day before he would share the stage with Mamata Banerjee, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a> had to answer questions by policemen at the office outside his palatial home in Bolpur, followed by more questions from his own team, before being allowed into his room on the ground floor.</p>\n<p>Reaching the address, however, had been much easier. The driver of a toto, a three-wheel battery-operated vehicle, had demanded Rs 80 for the 3-km trip but settled for Rs 40 as soon as he realised that the visit was to interview Mondal himself.</p>\n<p>Mondal denied allegations of violence. \u201cI have never believed in violence. I have never lifted a hand against anyone and hope I never have to,\u201d he said, clad in vest and shorts and preparing for a workout, while his SUV was being washed.</p>\n<p>He dismissed the countless allegations made by the Opposition about muscle power. During the panchayat elections, he had allegedly told supporters in public to hurl bombs at police should they try to help any independent candidates. Once showcaused, he told the Election Commission it was a slip of the tongue, that he had only meant it was the independents who were planning to hurl bombs at police vehicles.</p>\n<p>This time, one allegation doing the rounds is that Mondal\u2019s men have been visiting people\u2019s homes with a warning that CCTV cameras would monitor polling booths, so anyone not voting for the TMC would be found out. Mondal denied that too.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are stories cooked up by the Opposition and the media,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been going around telling people of the work done by Mamata Banerjee and that everyone should go and vote.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mondal has also been telling voters that the party would give them gur batasha (jaggery and sugar candy). Opposition leaders have interpreted it as a warning that they would \u201cget the treatment\u201d if they didn\u2019t vote for the TMC. Mondal\u2019s explanation is: \u201cConsidering the heat, we said we will help voters who queue up. I think members of all political parties should do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Other than the 11 assembly constituencies of Birbhum, Mamata has handed him the responsibility for Mangalkot, Ausgram and Ketugram in Burdwan district. Asked how he had won her confidence, he said it was because he had been following her instructions diligently.</p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=100&amp;h=315]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2754174&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/anubrata-mondal-birbhum-tmc-west-bengal-elections-2754174/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mamata-ec-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mamata-ec-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Mamata-ec-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/mamata-ec-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Anubrata Modal, Birbhum, TMC, Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal elections, West Bengla polls, Bengal polls, Birbhum rally, Birbhum Anubrata Mondal, Birbhum TMC, TMC news, India news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Phoolan Devi Jan Jagaran Sena \u2014 a \u2018political party\u2019 in making before \u201917 polls</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/phoolan-devi-jan-jagaran-sena-a-political-party-in-making-before-17-polls-2754095/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/phoolan-devi-jan-jagaran-sena-a-political-party-in-making-before-17-polls-2754095/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 00:44:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 00:44:16 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Lalmani Verma]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2754095</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Nishad said his outfit is formed by members of \u2018Eklavya Sena\u2019 -

The outfit had recently organised conventions in Lucknow where its workers resolved to take out state-wide \u2018rath yatras\u2019 from May onwards to reach out to \u201cnearly five lakh households\u201d before the elections. The chief said his outfit will attempt to mobilise people belonging to communities like Nishad, Kashyap, Mallah (boatmen) &#8211; all MBCs &#8211; and attempt to unite them in order to prevent their exploitation by political parties like SP, BSP, BJP and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>. Phoolan Devi belonged to Mallah community.</p>\n<p>Nishad said his outfit is formed by members of \u2018Eklavya Sena\u2019 &#8211; an organisation formed by Phoolan Devi herself and of which he was the district president of its Thane unit in Maharashtra.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter her (Phoolan\u2019s) assassination in 2001, I took charge as the UP state president of Eklavya Sena. I left that organisation because her husband, Umed Singh, was not interested in running the organisation. Most of the members of \u2018Phoolan Devi Jan Jagaran Sena\u2019 are former workers of Eklavya Sena. Our members include lawyers, journalists and people from other sections of the society who came in contact when Mummy ji (Nishad claims Phoolan and Umed regarded him as their son) was a <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> member,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The outfit holds against the ruling party its alleged \u201cfailure\u201d in getting ordered a CBI inquiry into the MP\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p>\u201cMulayam Singh Yadav had promised a CBI inquiry.

was organised by the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Department on 125th birth anniversary of B R Ambedkar.</p>\n<p>Coming down heavily on politicians for attacking him in the name of Pasi community, Kumar said they were not their benefactors and were only indulging in politics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They (leaders) want that people from Pasi community, traditionally occupied in toddy business, to always climb palm trees and never earn their name by educating themselves,&#8221; Kumar said, reminding people a hooch tragedy last year was the result of spurious toddy, blended with urea.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now these people (leaders) are advocating toddy just for the sake of politicising the issue,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Kumar&#8217;s assertion came in the wake of the criticism by different political parties and its leaders for his decision to enforce a complete prohibition in the state from April 5 that also included strict adherence to the 1991 guidelines.</p>\n<p>Senior <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> leader Sushil Kumar Modi yesterday charged Nitish Kumar of targeting the Pasi community by arresting them for selling toddy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When there is no ban on sale of toddy under the Bihar Excise Act, then on what ground Principal Secretary (Excise) K K Pathak has directed the district officials to crackdown on sale of toddy?&#8221; he had asked.</p>\n<p>BJP&#8217;s alliance partner and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi had termed Nitish Kumar as an &#8220;enemy of the Pasi community and that&#8217;s why the CM has banned toddy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the advise of IAS officer K K Pathak, Nitish Kumar has banned toddy in the state. Both Nitish and Pathak are enemies of Pasi community. Even doctors prescribe toddy, which is natural juice and banning the palm tree product is like inflicting torture on SC category people,&#8221; Manjhi said at a toddy sellers protest here on Monday last.</p>\n<p>Nitish, who assured the toddy selling community that their employment would not be affected, favoured &#8216;Neera&#8217;, which he said was a health drink and would be processed, packaged and marketed from next year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have prepared a scheme under which everything from palm tree juice to all other products made from palm tree will be promoted and marketed through Self Help Groups and cooperative&#8230; One can earn up to Rs 6,000 every year from a single tree,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Taking a firm stand on total liquor ban, Nitish said he has taken the decision after giving much thought to it and was quite confident of its successful implementation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People say liquor ban has proved to be a failure in the US, Gujarat and hence it will also fail in the state. I have taken it as a challenge&#8230; Why will it not be successful?&#8221; Kumar said asserting the ban would be made successful with people&#8217;s cooperation and with the help of the police and civil administration.</p>\n<p>Kumar said the liquor ban has gained momentum everywhere in the country and both prominent parties in Tamil Nadu have promised similar steps in the ongoing elections.</p>\n<p>The Chief Minister, who admitted it was his efforts which had increased the revenue from Rs 300 crore to Rs 5,000 crore, assured that license fees for running bars would be entirely returned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will return the license fees. The income of Rs 5,000 crore is from unethical trade and I don&#8217;t care for the loss at all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Education minister Ashok Choudhary, Mines and Geology minister Muneshwar Choudhary and state police chief P K Thakur were present at the function.</p>\n<p>News playlist:</p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=759&amp;h=422]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2753821&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/nitish-kumar-toddy-ban-bihar-2753821/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/nitish-kumar11.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/nitish-kumar11.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">nitish kumar1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/nitish-kumar3.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">nitish kumar, toddy ban, toddy ban bihar</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Election Commission slaps Mamata Banerjee with showcause notice</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/mamata-banerjee-election-commission-showcause-notice-tmc-west-bengal-elections/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/mamata-banerjee-election-commission-showcause-notice-tmc-west-bengal-elections/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2016 17:45:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2016 22:11:07 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2753704</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Mamata Banerjee, reacting to the notice, said that the people of Bengal will 'showcause' the Election Commission on May 19 for issuing a notice against her on Bengali New Year.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2753704&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2747647 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mamata-tmc-rally-759.jpg\" alt=\"mamata banerjee, west bengal\" /> South Dinajpur: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee during an election rally at Safanagar in South Dinajpur district of West Bengal,on Sunday.

He was the one who gave us our Constitution and worked hard to see that everyone gets equal opportunity. He was a true national icon and true patriot. He was an international leader,&#8221; Patel said at an award distribution ceremony held here.</p>\n<p>The ceremony was conducted as part of Ambedkar&#8217;s 125th birth anniversary celebrations by the Gujarat government. The Gujarat Chief Minister also asked people to walk the path shown by Ambedkar and come out of the age-old traditions and social evils.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe that only education cannot eradicate social evils and superstition from the society. Even today, people who are doctors are not ready to go for inter-caste marriages. We have to change our mindset to bring revolution,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>Patel claimed the (state) <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> government never indulged in vote-bank politics and only focused on development.</p>\n<p>Praising Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> for the development brought by him in the state as the Chief Minister, Patel said, &#8220;People still remember what Gujarat was before 2001 and what it has become today. You can see development all around. I believe that if (Narendra) Modi was not made the Chief Minister in 2001, our state might have been same today as it was prior to 2001.&#8221;</p>\n<p>State Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Ramanlal Vora and other Dalit leaders, MLAs, and MPs were also present.<br />\nVora said Ambedkar was true visionary, whose ideas were way ahead of his time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In those days (1950s), he gave a blue print about power generation, so that electricity can be supplied to each<br />\nhousehold.

Delhi is like a foreign land for me as other than the ministry I don&#8217;t have any roots in Delhi and at my age I don&#8217;t feel like developing new roots. Also my ministry is such that it is better not to develop new roots,&#8221; he said, adding that he missed Goan food as &#8220;it is not the same taste there (Delhi).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Parrikar has been Goa chief minister thrice.

A Lingayat leader and a staunch RSS man, he led the BJP to a historic victory in the state in 2008 and became Chief Minister.</p>\n<p>Battling corruption charges, he quit the BJP in 2011 and floated the Karnataka Janata Paksha before the 2013 assembly polls.

He also promised action against private power distribution company \u2014 Torrent Power Limited (TPL) \u2014 indulging in \u201cloot and scam\u201d and also against BJP and Congress allowing TPL to indulge in what he called \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cfleecing\u201d of the power consumers.</p>\n<p>Addressing mediapersons, Ashutosh said that Gujarat, after Maharashtra, was the only state charging the highest power tariff, that is above Rs 7 per unit for residential consumers. The power tariff in Delhi, he said, is Rs 3.20 per unit for residential users. Stating that power tariff had been raised to 150 per cent in the last five years by \u201cmanipulating\u2019\u2019 things in connivance with BJP and Congress, he demanded TPL accounts to be audited by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India to check malpractices and bringing TPL under RTI so that people could get all the information about the company easily.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/aap-2017-gujarat-assembly-elections-power-tariff-50-per-cent/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/ahemdabad-aap-to-launch-stir-against-high-power-tariff-from-april-15/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/arvind-kejriwal2.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Ahemdabad: AAP to launch stir against high power tariff from April 15</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/power-gets-costlier-cng-and-png-cheaper/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/03/power1.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Power gets costlier, CNG and PNG cheaper</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/assembly-polls-opposition-cornering-congress-on-power-issue-in-delhi/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/11/m_id_439874_sheila.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Assembly polls: Opposition cornering Congress on power issue in Delhi</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/power-bills-set-to-zoom/\"><span class=\"text\">Power bills set to zoom</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/torrent-power-to-follow-central-guidelines-on-subsidised-supply/\"><span class=\"text\">Torrent Power to follow Central guidelines on subsidised supply</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/gerc-announces-moderate-increase-in-power-tariff/\"><span class=\"text\">GERC announces moderate increase in power tariff</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>He stated that external auditors \u2014 N C Mittal and Company \u2014 in its 2010-11 audit report of TPL had observed that \u201cthere is a possibility of the state of affairs in the TPL\u2019s audit like the one reported in the infamous Satyam Case\u201d.</p>\n<p>Ashutosh asked PM <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> to answer as to why no action was initiated against TPL by him when he was CM at the time and the external audits were conducted at the behest of Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC). Ashutosh said that the external auditors had pointed out that TPL had prepared two parallel balance sheets audited by the same chartered accountant and \u201cmanipulated accounts\u201d.</p>\n<p>He said that TPL\u2019s losses of Rs 638 crore were found \u201cfabricated\u201d by NC Mittal and company. The audit report suggested that \u201caccounts of the company be rejected\u201d and \u201cthe action under law can be taken by GERC if required\u201d. He said TPL increased fixed charge by 400 per cent in the last five years, energy charge by 20 per cent and surcharge by 280 per cent and now they had added more charges as well.</p>\n<p>Quoting from Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) report, he said that TPL had paid Rs 34 crore to BJP and Rs 20 crore to Congress as election funds in the last 10 years and \u201cthis can possibly be the reason for the leadership of the two parties in the state to keep their mouth shut on the issue\u201d.</p>\n<p>Torrent Power officials were not available for any comments.</p>\n<p>Reacting to AAP allegations, L Chuaungo, principal secretary, energy and petrochemical department, Gujarat government, said the AAP should first analyse power situations across the country before making wild charges.</p>\n<p><em>With inputs from PTI.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

The party, he said, should try and come clean about the allegations, and the doubts raised. \u201cWe are in politics to serve the people&#8230;corruption in politics is demoralising,\u201d he said. He added that although nothing has been proved yet, to find so many leaders, including ministers, allegedly taking bribes on camera had its damaging impact.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul>\n<p>Abu Naser\u2019s remarks come in the middle of electioneering in Malda where the Trinamool Congress (TMC) is facing a stiff challenge from the combined opposition of the Communists and the Congress.\u00a0Top TMC leaders did not want to react to Abu Naser\u2019s comments on the sting.</p>\n<p>Abu Naser is a brother of late A B A Ghani Khan Chowdhury, one of Congress\u2019s tallest leaders in the state who won the Malda <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> seat on eight consecutive occasions after being an MLA on multiple occasions. Malda is considered the family\u2019s pocket borough.</p>\n<p>West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee had inducted Abu Naser in the party in June last year. A Congress MLA from Sujapur in 2011, he was a minister in Mamata\u2019s cabinet until the Congress withdrew support to her government.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Abu Hasem Khan Chowdhury, another brother of Ghani Khan Chowdhury, came out heavily against the TMC on Monday. Speaking with the media in Malda, Abu Hasem, a Congress MP from Malda (South) and a former minister in UPA -II, said the condition of the state is now like \u201cMughul-e-Azam\u201d, where an \u201caunt and nephew\u201d team (referring to Mamata and Abhishek Banerjee) are running a \u201cwhimsical\u201d government.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe CPM-Congress combine has come as a big challenge before Mamata Banerjee,\u201d Abu Hasem claimed, and predicted that the alliance\u2019s leader, CPM\u2019s Surjya Kanta Mishra, will be the new chief minister after the Assembly polls.</p>\n<p>Malda and Murshidabad are two traditional Congress strongholds, and the alliance is working hard to ensure that the anti-TMC vote is not split. The TMC is likely to face a straight fight with the alliance\u2019s candidate in most of the 12 seats in Malda and 22 assembly segments in Murshidabad. The TMC had hoped to make inroads in these two districts but now faces a big challenge following the alliance formed between the once bitter rivals.</p>\n<p>Malda is one of the few districts where AICC president <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/\">Sonia Gandhi</a> is expected to address an election rally \u2014 sources in state Congress put April 13 as a tentative campaign date.

Arunachal Pradesh script. \u201cIt is a blatant and brazen display of the authoritarian, anti-democratic and anti-Constitution mindset of the government,\u201d said Azad, adding that the latest move was \u201ca grim reminder of the threat\u201d that democratic institutions were facing.</p>\n<p>Azad was referring to the imposition of President\u2019s rule on January 24 in Congress-ruled Arunachal Pradesh, after 21 of the ruling party\u2019s 47 MLAs rebelled with support from the BJP. In Dehradun, meanwhile, Speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal said that under the anti-defection law, he had disqualified the nine Congress MLAs whose rebellion and association with the BJP earlier this month had triggered the latest crisis.</p>\n<p>According to sources, the Centre recommended imposition of President\u2019s rule to Mukherjee late on Saturday night, shortly after a decision to the effect was taken at an emergency meeting of the Union Cabinet called by Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> at 9:30 pm on Saturday.<br />\nAfter the Cabinet meeting, said sources, Jaitley briefed the President about Governor K K Paul\u2019s reports on the volatile political situation in the state and conveyed the Cabinet\u2019s recommendation for President\u2019s rule.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We will meet the Governor tomorrow- Harish Rawat <a href=\"http://twitter.com/hashtag/Uttarakhand?src=hash\">#Uttarakhand</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/Lu452YnPSn\">pic.twitter.com/Lu452YnPSn</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 ANI (@ANI_news) <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/714040368346443777\">March 27, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>A money deal was constructed, some people say in Rs 1000 crore, some say in Rs 500 crore: Harish Rawat <a href=\"http://twitter.com/hashtag/Uttarakhand?src=hash\">#Uttarakhand</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/wO6wN0kKuh\">pic.twitter.com/wO6wN0kKuh</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 ANI (@ANI_news) <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/714039755210534912\">March 27, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Most upsetting was that I had to make compromise with such a leader(Harak Singh Rawat) who used to value money above everything-Harish Rawat</p>\n<p>\u2014 ANI (@ANI_news) <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/714037238795882496\">March 27, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>At the Cabinet meeting held at the Prime Minister\u2019s residence for around one-and-half hours, the Cabinet took stock of the developments in the state, discussed reports sent by the Governor, and also a sting video released by rebel Congress MLAs purportedly of Chief Minister Rawat indulging in horse-trading to save his government.</p>\n<p>Releasing the video on Saturday, rebel Congress MLA Harak Singh Rawat had alleged that Rawat was trying to bribe the rebels and a few other BJP MLAs to support him. He also alleged that the rebel MLAs have been receiving life threats. The MLAs had rebelled against the Chief Minister on March 18, when they sought a vote division on the floor of the House on the Appropriation Bill.

It also had the support of six members of the Progressive Democratic Front, while the Opposition BJP has 28 legislators. The Speaker had later served notice to the rebel MLAs, seeking their responses by March 26 on why they should not be disqualified for violating party discipline and aligning with the BJP.

Rubbaiya is the younger daughter of the late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, then the Union Home Minister of India. Her kidnapping in 1989 by the Jammu and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/\">Kashmir</a> Liberation Front (JKLF) had led to a swap deal in which five terrorists were released.</p>\n<p>Mishra asked Shah, \u201cDoes Mehbooba Mufti believe in saying \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019? If not, will the BJP still form a government with her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore taking charge of J&amp;K, will Mehbooba Mufti say it once before the entire country \u201cAfzal Guru was a terrorist, Afzal Guru Murdabad\u201d? If not, why are you (Shah) so desperate to form a government with her?\u201d Mishra asked Shah.<br />\nGuru, accused in the 2001 attack on the parliament, was hanged in February 2013. In 2011, the PDP had supported a resolution in the J&amp;K assembly seeking clemency for Guru.</p>\n<p>Mishra\u2019s third question was, \u201cDoesn\u2019t sending a union minister to Pakistan on Pakistan Day under pressure from Mehbooba, make the country look weak before the the world?\u201d</p>\n<p>In his final question, Mishra asked Shah if Mufti was the reason that a team of Pakistani investigators are being allowed to come to India to probe the Pathankot attack. \u201cThe world is now wondering if India does not believe that the Pakistani army and the government provide training and weapons to terrorists to attack India. In one shot you have weakened the country\u2019s several years-old stand against state-sponsored terrorism,\u201d wrote Mishra.</p>\n<p>Mishra wrote that it would be a \u2018black day\u2019 in the country, if Mufti takes charge as the chief minister of J&amp;K and endorses the BJP. \u201cAs a common Indian, I feel that the political compromise being made by BJP and the Sangh, will cost the country dearly. The entire country is watching the BJP blindly running from one state to another to gain power or be a partner in it, in which rules, laws and limits find no place,\u201d wrote Mishra.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it comes to J&amp;K the country must come before political gains,\u201d Mishra told Shah in his letter written in Hindi.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease take the country into confidence before forming this unholy coalition government. The day this unholy government takes control, I, as an ordinary Indian, will wear a black ribbon to express my disappointment,\u201d said Mishra.</p>\n<p>With his sarcasm intact, Mishra signed off as \u2018aapka shubhechchuk (your well wisher)\u2019. And under his signature, it read, \u2018Kapil Mishra, Ek aam Hindustani (An ordinary Indian)\u2019.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

Vijayakanth, Tamil Nadu, Tamil Nadu elections, Tamil Nadu DMDK, DMDK alliance, DMDK tamil nadu, DMDK chief Vijayakanth, tamil nadu elections 2016, dmdk news, tamil nadu elections news, tamil nadu news, india news\" /> Viajayakanth (second right) is greeted by Vaiko,Thol Thirumavalavan and other PWF leaders Wednesday. PTI\n<p>CAPTAIN VIJAYAKANTH reemerged as a key player for the Tamil Nadu elections Wednesday, tying up with a four-party front that decided to project him as their chief ministerial candidate.</p>\n<p>An NDA partner in 2014, Vijayakanth had announced two weeks ago that his DMDK would contest on its own this time. This had led to speculation whether he would fade into obscurity or eventually go back on his decision. The turnaround came following a meeting with a delegation of the People\u2019s Welfare Front that comprises Vaiko\u2019s MDMK the CPM, the CPI, and Thol Thirumavalavan\u2019s Dalit party VCK. Vijayakanth\u2019s office issued in a statement that his party will contest 124 seats, the PWA the remaining 110.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Elections 2016</h4><ul>\n<p>With Vijayakanth lending muscle to the PWF, the election becomes a contest among four major fronts, the other three being those led by the AIADMK, the DMK, and the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fight of the DMDK-PWF is against the AIADMK government,\u201d said CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan.</p>\n<p>And Vaiko, who leads the PWF, said, \u201cThe DMK has been relegated to being the third front. We will work together for the victory of the front and Vijayakanth will be the king.\u201d</p>\n<p>With the hugely popular actor-politician on board, the PWF hopes to consolidate votes from across sections. Of the parties in the front, the VCK will target Dalit voters, who form 21 per cent of the electorate, while the two communist parties will seek to revive their vote banks in central and southern Tamil Nadu. The PWF is hoping to consolidate further by drawing in smaller parties such as AAP, P Nedumaran\u2019s Tamil National Front, and some Muslim parties.</p>\n<p>Vijayakanth has been wooed by various parties since he formed the DMDK in 2005 and won 8 per cent of the vote in 2006 \u2014 this was more than S Ramadoss\u2019s PMK and Vaiko\u2019s MDMK managed. In the 2009 <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> polls, his party grew to nearly 10 per cent. In 2011, he allied with the AIADMK and won 29 seats. But in 2014, when he joined the NDA, his vote share dropped to 5 per cent and he failed to win any Lok Sabha seat.</p>\n<p>The DMK and the BJP dismissed Vijayakanth\u2019s partnership with the PWF.</p>\n<p>The BJP state leadership, which had been trying to get Vijayakanth back with the NDA, now said they will contest 234 constituencies. \u201cWe feel pity for Vijayakanth for his decision to join the PWF,\u201d said state BJP president Tamilisai Soundararajan.</p>\n<p>DMK treasurer M K Stalin said the new partnership will not affect his party\u2019s prospects. The DMK sealed an agreement with long-term ally Indian Union Muslim League Wednesday, giving it five seats.<br />\nAlso Wednesday, actor-politician R Sarath Kumar of the AISMK visited J Jayalalithaa\u2019s Poes Garden home. Sarath Kumar had recently walked out of the AIADMK alliance to join the NDA and later met BJP Union Minister Prakash Javadekar. Now, he has extended the AISMK\u2019s support to Jayalalithaa. \u201cAmma thanked him for the same,\u201d a statement said.</p>\n<p>An AIADMK leader said Vijaykanth\u2019s decision to tie up with the PWF can only favour the AIADMK. \u201cNow there are four fronts including our party, DMK, DMDK-PWF alliance and the NDA,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The DMK camp argues that Vijayakanth and his alliance will eat into the AIADMK votes, as had happened in 2006. \u201cEven if one argues that the opposition votes will be split, the AIADMK is going to suffer as both the NDA and the DMDK will spoil their chances,\u201d said a DMK leader.</p>\n<p><strong>BJP looks elsewhere</strong></p>\n<p>Isolated by its former allies, the BJP said Wednesday it is now putting together a new alliance with smaller parties. It will decide its first list of candidates Thursday. \u201cThe BJP, along with our friends IJK, NJP and some other parties, is contesting.

They should return those gifts as well as those received during the NDA regime over eight years,&#8221; Rabri Devi said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, unhappy over the controversy, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was said to have decided to do away with the practice.

He was referring to seats from where both parties have nominated candidates.</p>\n<p>State Congress president Adhir Chowdhury had recently claimed that while his party had nominated candidates after holding several meetings with Left leaders, the allies of the Left have announced candidates on seats that the Congress would contest.</p>\n<p>When asked, Bose said, \u201cIt has been decided that at places, where candidates of Left allies had won in the last <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> polls, would be nominated this time as well&#8230; But this is not being adhered to and thus the confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p>He also hinted that Chowdhury had not considered all the names of candidates that Congress has nominated. \u201cI am not sure if the state Congress president has seen all the lists before the same were released&#8230; If he had, there would not have been so much confusion,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>He, however, was quick to add: \u201cThere was no confusion regarding the first phase of elections. The first phase would be conducted on two days \u2014 April 4 and 11. Confusion prevailing on candidates contesting on these two days has been solved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the next three phases \u2014 on April 17, 21 and 25 \u2014 the nomination process is yet to begin. Naming candidates doesn\u2019t mean they are final.

about the deadlock over government formation in Jammu and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/\">Kashmir</a> with <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The PDP president is likely to hold a meeting with senior party leaders in the next few days to inform them about the last week&#8217;s developments on government formation,&#8221; sources in the PDP said.</p>\n<p>The sources said the date of the meeting has not been finalised yet as several senior party leaders are stuck in Jammu &#8220;due to closure of the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The PDP and the BJP failed to end the deadlock on government formation as the meeting between their respective party presidents &#8212; Mehbooba and Amit Shah on Thursday &#8212; could not make any headway.</p>\n<p>While the BJP said it could not form the government based on fresh conditions put forth by the PDP, the regional party maintained that there were no new demands made by it but it only wanted assurances on a timeframe for implementation of the &#8220;Agenda of Alliance&#8221; agreed between the two parties last year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The BJP is trying to give an impression that the PDP is making some new demands for the government formation which is not true.We only want implementation of the agenda of alliance.These misgvings have to be cleared,&#8221; the PDP source said.</p>\n<p>The sources said the issues flagged by the PDP president during her meeting with BJP top leaders are part of the agenda of alliance which was finalised by PDP patron Mufti Mohammad Sayeed with the national party.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The PDP president has made it clear time and again that she will stand by her father&#8217;s decision of forming an alliance with the BJP as he was convinced that it is in the interests of the people of the state.All that Mehbooba wants to ensure is that the promises made to her father in terms of political initiatives and economic progress of the state see the light of the day,&#8221; they said.</p>\n<p>The sources said Mehbooba may also hold a press conference &#8220;in a day or two&#8221; to put forth her party&#8217;s stand on the ongoing deadlock.</p>\n<p>Jammu and Kashmir was put under Governor&#8217;s Rule on January 8, a day after the death of incument Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.</p>\n<p>If the deadlock over government formation continues, Governor N N Vohra, who has been the helm of administrative affairs in the state for over two months now, will have not option but to dissolve and assembly and recommend holding of fresh assembly elections.</p>\n<p>While the legal experts here are divided on the sectionof the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir to be applied for dissolution of the assembly, Vohra will have to do it between April 9 and July 8 this year.</p>\n<p>According to Section 53 of the state constitution, the Governor is bound to dissolve the assembly if more than six months lapse between the last sitting and first sitting of two sessions of the legislature.</p>\n<p>The sitting of the assembly was held on October 10 last year.</p>\n<p>According to section 92, Governor&#8217;s Rule will automatically come to an end after six months of its imposition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Any such Proclamation (Governor Rule) whether varied under subsection (2) or not, shall except where it is a Proclamation revoking a previous Proclamation, cease to operate on the expiration of six months from the date on which it was first issued,&#8221; subsection 3 of Section 92 reads.</p>\n<p>PDP emerged as the single largest party in the 2014 assembly polls with 28 seats (now 27 only following Sayeed&#8217;s death) in the 87-member house.</p>\n<p>The BJP has 25 seats followed by National Conference (15) and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> (12) and People&#8217;s Conference (two).</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2718141&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/jk-govt-deadlock-mehbooba-mufti-likely-to-call-meeting-pf-pdp-leaders-soon/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/mehbooba-mufti-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/mehbooba-mufti-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">mehbooba-mufti-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/mehbooba-mufti-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">pdp, bjp, pdp bjp, bjp pdp, jammu kashmir, j&#038;K, J&#038;k govt, pdp bjp govt, mehbooba mufti, mehbooba mufti meeting, pdp meeting, pdp news, j&#038;k news, Jammu kashmir govt, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Freedom of expression gives no right to destroy nation, says Arun Jaitley</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/bjp-fully-committed-to-agenda-of-governance-in-jk-arun-jaitley/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/bjp-fully-committed-to-agenda-of-governance-in-jk-arun-jaitley/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2016 14:18:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2016 19:07:00 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2718118</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[\"We stand fully committed as far as the agenda of governance is concerned with reference to J&#38;K,\" Jaitley said.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2718118&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2591894 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/jaitley759.jpg\" alt=\"Arun Jaitley, bharatiya janata party, jnu row, jawaharlal nehru university, freedom of speech, nationalism, uttarakhand, Jammu and kashmir, bjp j&amp;K, bjp jnu row, bjp uttarakhand crisis, india news, bjp news, kashmir news, latest news\" /> Union Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/arun-jaitley/\">Arun Jaitley</a> said &#8220;freedom of expression and nationalism do necessarily co-exist&#8221;

The Dandi yatra was taken out by Mahatma Gandhi on March 12, 1930, to oppose the salt laws imposed by the then British government.</p>\n<p>Alleging that RSS-ABVP activists were forcibly trying to impose their saffron ideology in universities and educational institutions, ever since Modi became the Prime Minister in May 2014, the Congress leader said that, &#8220;This resulted in suicide committed by Dalit scholar <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/topic/rohith-suicide-case/\">Rohith Vemula</a> of Hyderabad Central University and JNU research scholar Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested on sedition charges and branded anti-national&#8221;

But the people will give a fitting reply to such an unholy\u00a0nexus,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Over the past four-and-half years, Mamata said, Bengal has largely reclaimed its old\u00a0glory, having overcome the days of mass murder, massacres and sheer\u00a0corruption of the Left.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuring this short span, the TMC government had\u00a0provided the people with social, economic and cultural stability,\u201d she\u00a0claimed and went on to say that her government has achieved more than it\u00a0had promised.</p>\n<p>Referring to Singur \u2013 one of her government\u2019s unfulfilled promises, she\u00a0said that the matter was dragged to court after the Government brought the\u00a0Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Act with the view to return land<br />\nto the affected farmers. The case is still pending in the Supreme Court of\u00a0India and she promised that no stone will remain unturned in her\u00a0government\u2019s resolve to find a solution to the problem as quickly as\u00a0possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe land owners of Singur will get back their property and dignity \u2013 that\u00a0it our foremost promise,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>But the TMC government will continue\u00a0to pursue a policy against forceful land acquisition, she added. \u201cFarmers\u00a0of Singur will definitely get justice,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>The chief minister said that the 14th March Nandigram massacre day is\u00a0approaching and the Trinamool Congress will hold a rally in Nandigram and\u00a0other parts of the state to condemn those mass murders. \u201cThis reminds us\u00a0of the mass murders of so many Congress workers by the CPM in Bengal. But\u00a0they have been sold to the CPM. I feel sad and angry.\u201d</p>\n<p>She said that her government promises to carry on the development projects\u00a0that are underway and at the same time plans to execute more new projects.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a host of other plans. Those plans would take Bengal to the top in\u00a0terms agriculture and industry. The vision of &#8216;New Bengal&#8217; would be\u00a0realised through the establishment of industries and empowerment of youth.\u00a0Keeping these two vital factors in mind we would march ahead in to a new\u00a0era of Bengal,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Mamata said that her government will give utmost priority to creating improved\u00a0rural and urban infrastructure.\u00a0The growth of industry\u00a0and agriculture will be given emphasis along with empowerment of the youth, she said.</p>\n<p><em>Some of the highlights of the manifesto:</em></p>\n<p># TMC government will follow a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy towards crime,\u00a0especially women. As many as 65 all women police stations are coming up of\u00a0which 30 are already functional.</p>\n<p># As per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics Kolkata is much\u00a0safer than Delhi, Madhya Pradesh or Rajasthan.</p>\n<p># Health for all. The government will generate a new wave of health care\u00a0systems along with what had already been achieved. Fair price medicine\u00a0shops and free medical treatment to all in government hospitals will be\u00a0improved and extended.</p>\n<p># In the efforts of industrialization, the state has a long way to go.\u00a0But the state will never back out from the challenges and its remains in\u00a0the focus.</p>\n<p># Bring transparency in panchayats and zilla parishads. House for all and\u00a0100 days work will be expanded. Water supply would be extended.</p>\n<p># Agriculture is the pride of Bengal. The government will take care of\u00a0the farmers and their lands and ensure Bengal remains green in future.</p>\n<p># Bengal will be marketed globally as a hot tourist destination.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2705578&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/politics/mamata-banerjee-tmc-manifesto-west-bengal/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/mamata-banerjee2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/mamata-banerjee2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Preparations for upcoming WB Assembly elections</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/mamata-banerjee1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Kolkata: TMC cand West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee with party leaders during the release of her party&#039;s manifesto in Kolkata on Friday for the upcoming State Assembly elections.

Kishor had effectively used his band of volunteers in the Bihar polls.</p>\n<p>Talk is that Kishor has already conducted preliminary surveys and would come armed with inputs on what the Congress needed to do to win the state, after a string of disappointing losses.</p>\n<p>Congress has declared Punjab PCC Chief Amarinder Singh as the party&#8217;s &#8216;face&#8217; in the polls after Rahul Gandhi held a series of meeting with state leaders to persuade them to present a united face of the faction-ridden state unit. Singh, a former Chief Minister, is considered the most formidable leader of the party in the state.</p>\n<p>Congress had lost the last assembly elections despite Rahul declaring Amarinder as the chief ministerial candidate in the midst of the campaign.</p>\n<p>Since the debacle in the last <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> elections, Congress has been losing state after state.</p>\n<p>Rahul had held a meeting with Uttar Pradesh Congress leaders in New Delhi last week at which Kishor was present. It saw an intense discussion on how things could be turned around in the politically most crucial state. Congress is in political wilderness in the key cow belt state since 1989 when the emergence of the &#8216;Mandal and Mandir&#8217; issues aided the rise of the BSP.</p>\n<p>Talk in the Congress is that Kishor&#8217;s services could be utilised by the party in Narendra Modi&#8217;s home state Gujarat if he could give good results in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. While UP and Punjab elections are scheduled early next year, Gujarat elections could be held at end of 2017 as the term of the assembly there ends on 22 January 2018.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2697459&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/punjab-polls-rahul-to-brainstorm-with-congress-leaders-prashant-kishor-next-week/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/amarinder-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/amarinder-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">AMARINDER   480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aae92616a6f221756428ed6d77d18339?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aaronexpress</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/amarinder-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">amarinder singh, amarinder singh interview, akali dal, Punjab congress, punjab congress president</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Prashant Bhushan slams BJP for not acting against MLA</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/prashant-bhushan-slams-bjp-for-not-acting-against-mla/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/prashant-bhushan-slams-bjp-for-not-acting-against-mla/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2016 01:27:31 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2016 01:27:31 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2696951</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Meena, who represents the Aklera constituency, was reportedly caught on camera attacking members of the MKSS as the march passed through Aklera.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2696951&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senior Supreme Court lawyer and former Aam Aadmi Party member Prashant Bhushan on Saturday slammed the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> government, accusing it of destroying institutions of accountability and creating conditions \u201cworse than Emergency\u201d.</p>\n<p>Bhushan was here to lend support to social activists from Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan who are demanding the arrest of <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> MLA Kanwarlal Meena who allegedly attacked the MKSS-led accountability march in January.</p>\n<p>Meena, who represents the Aklera constituency, was reportedly caught on camera attacking members of the MKSS as the march passed through Aklera.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere is a case where a BJP MLA is seen attacking peaceful activists on camera and the government still can\u2019t arrest him?

(Express Archive)\n<p>At 11, Purno Agitok Sangma lost his father, after which poverty forced him to quit studies. Things were so bad that he would tend cattle in exchange for a meal, and went hungry on many days. But a Salesian father helped him return to school and ensured he got a hostel room. Little did he know at the time that the student he was helping would one day contest for the post of President of India.</p>\n<p>Sangma, who had six siblings, was born on September 1, 1947 in Chapahati, a village on the border with Bangladesh, about 340 km from Shillong. He would often say that had it not been for Father Giovanni Battista Busolin, an Italian Salesian running a school and a church in Garo Hills, he would not have become what he did.</p>\n<p>Once he returned to school, there was no looking back. He did his BA from St Anthony\u2019s College, Shillong, before shifting to Dibrugarh in Assam, where he taught in Don Bosco High School while pursuing MA in international politics from Dibrugarh University. At night, he would attend law college.</p>\n<p>Briefly a lawyer and a journalist, Sangma was eventually drawn to politics, with the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> appointing him vice-president of the Youth Congress in 1973. Four years later, he was elected to <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> from Tura, a constituency which he continued to represent almost continuously, except in the ninth Lok Sabha, which lasted about 13 months.</p>\n<p>First appointed a deputy minister for industries by Indira Gandhi in 1980, Sangma remained an MoS for over 12 years, serving in different ministries like Commerce, Supply, Home and Labour, until he was made a cabinet minister for I&amp;B in the Narasimha Rao government in 1995-96.</p>\n<p>His greatest moment arrived on May 23, 1996 when Sangma, just 49 at the time, was elected Lok Sabha Speaker. This marked many firsts \u2014 of being unanimously elected Speaker, of being the first Speaker from the Opposition, the first from a Scheduled Tribe as well as the first Christian. He was also the first tribal to become a cabinet minister at the Centre in 1995.</p>\n<p>Uncompromising when it came to safeguarding the fundamentals of national interests, his tenure as labour minister saw a sharp decline in industrial strikes and lock-outs in the country.</p>\n<p>Known for his photographic memory, meticulous homework and complete mastery of subjects at hand, Sangma always had total control over the House, ensuring that rules were strictly observed even in the midst of stormy debates. His ability to pick up languages to communicate with members from different states remains inimitable.</p>\n<p>Sangma came from a matrilineal society, and his stint as Speaker saw the formation of a Standing Joint Parliamentary Committee on Empowerment of Women as well as a Joint Parliamentary Committee for considering the Constitution (81st Amendment) Bill, 1996 that sought to provide 33 per cent reservation for women in Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies.</p>\n<p>But Sangma faced controversies later in his political career, especially when he quit the Congress along with Sharad Pawar and Tariq Anwar over party president <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/\">Sonia Gandhi</a>\u2019s foreign origin, and formed the NCP in 1999. He did not get along well with Pawar and left the NCP in 2004 for the Trinamool Congress, from which he was elected to Lok Sabha that year. Two years later, he rejoined the NCP and returned to state politics, getting elected as an MLA in 2008.</p>\n<p>Four years later, he stood as a candidate for the President\u2019s office in June 2012, which created another rift between him and Pawar, prompting him to resign once more. Sangma lost the election, despite the Opposition <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>, AIADMK and BJD extending support. In 2013, he launched the National People\u2019s Party (NPP) and returned to Lok Sabha in 2014, attending it regularly \u2014 even the day before he died.</p>\n<p>While campaigning for elections, Sangma would often crack jokes and tell life stories instead of hitting out at opponents. He would stop for tea at a roadside stall, inquiring about the crop. Sometimes he would even take part in a village football match.</p>\n<p>The last time he delivered a lecture was at the end of an inter-college debate organised by Sonapur College on the outskirts of Guwahati on January 28, 2016. \u201cThe voice of the Northeast is not sufficiently heard in Parliament, in Delhi and across the country. We have to raise our voice to be heard properly. We need fearless public speakers like Hem Barua, Dinesh Goswami and G G Swell. Those were the kind of leaders and public representatives we had in the past who spoke fearlessly, loudly and clearly. We have to produce such leaders, and in more numbers,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>His name was Purno, which in most languages means complete, total. Sangma indeed lived a purno life.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2695006&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/sangma-lok-sabha-speaker-obituary-death/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/sangma-daughter-2014-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/sangma-daughter-2014-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">SANGMA-daughter-2014-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/sangma-daughter-2014-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">PA Sangma, PA Sangma biography, PA Sangma profile, PA Sangma obituary, PA Sangma death, india news, sangma death,</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Bihar: Oppn attacks Nitish govt as Tej Pratap skips House session again</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/bihar-oppn-attacks-nitish-govt-as-tej-pratap-skips-house-session-again/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/bihar-oppn-attacks-nitish-govt-as-tej-pratap-skips-house-session-again/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2016 01:52:48 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2016 01:52:48 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2695862</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[When JD(U)\u2019s Phulwari Sharif MLA Shyam Rajak asked a question as to why the sex ratio in Bihar was increasing, rural development minister Shravan Kumar stood up to answer. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2695862&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Opposition <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> Friday targeted the state government yet again as Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav skipped the Assembly session on a day when he had to answer questions.

The number of students studying in these institutions is far below their target capacity. The V-C of AMU has alleged that the HRD Minister is blocking the growth of the university.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you feel AMU has been targeted?</strong></p>\n<p>This is the NDA government\u2019s policy of suppressing minority institutions. By reducing funds, it is discriminating against minorities.</p>\n<p><strong>How have the other opposition members reacted?</strong></p>\n<p>Other opposition members also shared the concern. The NDA government, according to other MPs including Sharad Yadav, Anand Sharma and Sitaram Yechury, has told the court that AMU is not a minority institution.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you see AMU\u2019s treatment in the light of events in JNU and Hyderabad University?</strong></p>\n<p>This is part of the government\u2019s saffronisation agenda. Wherever the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> is not in power or does not have enough influence, it is the tendency of fascist forces to suppress the voices of others.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your next course of action?</strong></p>\n<p>We will try and raise the issue at the highest level, since almost the entire opposition is united on the issue.

A notice for this motion is likely to be given by BJP leader Arjun Meghwal and ally LJP\u2019s Chirag Paswan, sources said.</p>\n<p>The real target is Rahul, who had used the expression to taunt Finance Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/arun-jaitley/\">Arun Jaitley</a>\u2019s budgetary proposal allowing a window to domestic investors on announcing their undisclosed income within a stipulated time. BJP floor leaders have approached Jaitley, also I&amp;B minister, to prepare a reply if the discussion comes up in the House.</p>\n<p>However, party leaders were not sure whether Speaker Sumitra Mahajan would allow such a motion in the House, where tempers between the treasury benches and the opposition are already running high.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy using that expression, Rahul Gandhi has exposed his mindset. By stressing that, what he meant was anything dark was ugly,\u201d a BJP leader said.</p>\n<p>In his speech during the debate on the motion of thanks Wednesday, Rahul has said: \u201cThey launched a Fair and Lovely yojana to convert black money into white money. Modiji had promised that he would put people with black money behind bars, now they have come up with ways to save those people.\u201d</p>\n<p>The BJP has already collected details of protests across the country by activists and NGOs against advertisements on complexion-lightening products. In 2003, when Hindustan Lever Ltd came out with an advertisement on Fair and Lovely, women activists have protested saying it was a \u201chighly racist campaign\u201d. Following the campaign, the ad was taken off the air.</p>\n<p>The ad had shown a dark girl\u2019s father lamenting that he did not have a son to earn for him \u2014 a suggestion that his daughter would not get a better job or get married because of her complexion. It had gone on to show the girl using the cream to become fairer and getting a job as an air-hostess.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe campaign that can be set off with a debate in the Lok Sabha can turn into a movement against such a mindset,\u201d said a party leader.</p>\n<p>With Rahul leading the campaign against the BJP and Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> on the JNU row and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/topic/rohith-suicide-case/\">Rohith Vemula</a>\u2019s suicide, the ruling party has decided to train its guns on the Gandhis.

Chatterjee agreed that parties, when in opposition, behave in a certain manner and behave entirely differently when in power. \u201cVery much so. When a party is at the receiving end, then it realises the importance of smooth functioning of Parliament,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Chatterjee also slammed the slapping of <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/\">sedition</a> charges against JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar calling it \u201cheight of intolerance\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the most unfortunate decision,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Modi Thursday reproduced Chatterjee\u2019s 2004 Bhim Sen Sachar Memorial Lecture. Chatterjee had said: \u201cStopping the sittings of the House&#8230; is totally counter-productive &#8230;a feeling has developed among parties that interruption&#8230;will establish the importance of a subject or issue agitating one or another of the parties. Obstructing Parliament\u2019s functioning should be equated with an expression of lack of confidence in the parliamentary system itself \u2014 if not as a declaration of war on the people of the country.\u201d</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2694452&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/in-lok-sabha-modi-quotes-somnath-who-says-look-who-is-talking/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/narendra_modi_4801.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/narendra_modi_4801.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Narendra Modi at Nayi Disha Naya Sankalp</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad19eff6049dd5571c755a3dacf699fc?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">namithans</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/narendra_modi_7591.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\"> Prime Minister, Narendra Modi interacts with the students &#038; teachers, at the event \u0093Nayi Disha, Naya Sankalp\u0094, in New Delhi on Sunday.

However, reports of the split are still being denied by both K M Mani and P J Joseph, whose faction in the party have turned rebels now.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the latest development ahead of the state assembly polls, reportedly comes after Mani decided to promote his son Jose K Mani, the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> leader of the party, sidelining other senior leaders. The leaders who have decided to leave the party were forced to take the decision after they felt that they may not be getting seats in the election.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/another-split-imminent-in-kerala-congress-mani-senior-leaders-set-to-join-ldf/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-elections-2016-kerala-congress-m-rebels-form-new-party-may-join-ldf/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/04/vote_480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Kerala Congress (M) rebels form new party, may join LDF</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/kerala-assembly-elections-2016-live-updates-cpm-congress-bjp/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/kerala-polls-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Kerala Elections 2016: LDF, UDF release respective manifestos</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/bar-bribery-scandal-mani-should-have-stepped-down-says-his-party-vice-chairman/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/03/km-mani.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Bar bribery scandal: Mani should have stepped down, says his party vice-chairman</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/bar-bribe-scam-mani-snears-at-speculations-of-resignation/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/01/kk-mani-s.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Bar bribe scam: Mani sneers at speculations of resignation</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/rsp-as-ally-comes-with-a-price-for-cong-led-udf/\"><span class=\"text\">RSP as ally comes with a price for Cong-led UDF </span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/cpm-meet-resolves-to-unite-forces-disenchanted-with-udf/\"><span class=\"text\">CPM meet resolves to unite forces disenchanted with UDF</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>It was in April 2010 the Kerala Congress (Joseph), an erstwhile ally of left front in Kerala, who was also an education minister in LDF government, decided to pull out of the ruling LDF government to merge his Kerala Congress (J) party with Kerala Congress (Mani). If the timely decision in 2010 had helped Joseph retain power despite a regime change in the state, now he is losing grip on his own leaders after the senior leadership of his faction decided to join the left front.</p>\n<p>Sources close to K Francis George, one of the rebel leaders, said they may be announcing their decision to join the Left Front by Thursday evening. But Joseph and Mani camps denied these reports. They told reporters that all negotiations over the seat sharing had been settled and there is no need for a split. However, the rebel group believes that they may be sidelined by Mani, who controls the party as he wants to elevate his son.</p>\n<p>In November 2015, after Mani resigned from the post of state finance minister following allegations in the bar bribery case, he had been facing troubles in Congress-led UDF as well as in his own party.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kerala-assembly-elections-2016-live-updates-cpm-congress-bjp/\">Also read: Kerala Assembly Elections Live Blog: Will it be VS or Vijayan leading the LDF?</a></strong></p>\n<p>While final round talks are on between Mani and Joseph, political experts see that the imminent split leaving Joseph alone in the Mani group would be detrimental to his political career too as he had been hostile in the Mani camp.</p>\n<p>After the Kerala Congress party was formed in 1972, Mani, then a prominent youth leader, had led to the first split in 1976 following a tussle with leader K Balakrishna Pillai after the death of K M George,one of the founders.</p>\n<p>While Mani formed Kerala Congress (M) in 1976, Pillai also came out of the party to start Kerala Congress (B). With 20 MLAs, Mani group was at the verge of yet another split in 1979 when P J Joseph, another emerging leader in the Kerala Congress chose his own path, leaving the party with six MLAs, making both Mani and Joseph groups significant in Kerala politics.</p>\n<p>However, in 1982, Pillai returned to the Mani group. In 1985, Mani struck another deal with Joseph bringing him back to the party giving him the post of party Chairman.</p>\n<p>The year 1987 was the most happening year Kerala Congress history when Mani and Joseph parted ways, a year ahead of Joseph\u2019s entry into the Left Front, where he would enjoy a prominent space with his powerful vote base in Idukki and part of Kottayam and Ernakulam districts.</p>\n<p>While Pillai revived his party in 1993, Joseph became the education minister in 1996 in the LDF government under veteran CPI(M) leader E K Nayanar.</p>\n<p>When the splits and merger tales went on, \u2018growth by mutation\u2019 was the political secret of the Kerala Congress family. Over time at least half a dozen splinter groups were formed by small time leaders.</p>\n<p>After the Mani-Pillai-Joseph generation in Kerala Congress, it was P C George and P C Thomas who split their parties in 2003. When George formed Kerala Congress (Secular) leaving Joseph group, Thomas formed IFDP, leaving the Mani group. When Thomas returned to Joseph camp in two years after enjoying power with NDA alliance, George, in 2009, returned to Mani camp.</p>\n<p>When the historical merger of Joseph and Mani happened in 2010, Thomas chose to join the LDF. And for the very existence of Kerala Congress, the splits and merger will continue.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2693446&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/another-split-imminent-in-kerala-congress-mani-senior-leaders-set-to-join-ldf/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/k-m-mani-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/k-m-mani-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">k-m-mani-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/aae92616a6f221756428ed6d77d18339?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aaronexpress</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/k-m-mani1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">k-m-mani</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>AAP MLA uses derogatory language against Modi govt</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/aap-mla-uses-derogatory-language-against-modi-govt/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/aap-mla-uses-derogatory-language-against-modi-govt/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2016 03:01:47 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2016 03:01:47 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2691809</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Video of Amanatullah Khan at public rally surfaces, party defends him<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2691809&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2691825 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/aap-mla-khan-759.jpg\" alt=\"aap, aap mla, aap news, aap mla khan, aap mla against modi govt, narendra modi, delhi news, india news\" /> AAP maintained that the comments by the Okhla MLA were \u201cnot a personal attack on the Prime Minister but a justified complaint against the central government.\u201d\n<p>The Aam Aadmi Party Tuesday came to the defence of party MLA Amanatullah Khan, after a video surfaced in which the legislator from Okhla was seen using derogatory language against the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> government.</p>\n<p>The party maintained that the comments by the Okhla MLA were \u201cnot a personal attack on the Prime Minister but a justified complaint against the central government.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the video, Khan was seen backing Delhi-based Islamic scholar Mufti Abdus Sami, who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency in early February over the agency\u2019s \u2018open FIR\u2019 against the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/islamic-state/\">Islamic State</a>.</p>\n<p>The video was recorded on February 16, while Khan was addressing a gathering at the Red Fort during a mushaira. Admitting that he had used derogatory language against the Narendra Modi-led government, Khan told <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a>, \u201cYes, I have used the word ha&#8230;&#8230;. for the central government because it has been denying the poor and the minorities their rights. It has been batting for the industrialists and the haves and depriving the have-nots. The literal meaning of the word ha&#8230;&#8230;. is one who takes away what does not belong to him. Is this not what the Modi government is doing by depriving the minorities and the poor?\u201d</p>\n<p>During his speech, the MLA also urged members of the Muslim community to \u2018gherao\u2019 Union Home Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rajnath-singh/\">Rajnath Singh</a>\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p>The video showed Khan telling the audience, \u201cIf all of you decide to gherao the Home Minister\u2019s residence&#8230;Delhi has a huge Muslim population.</p>\n<p>If you start doing that, I can assure you that the government will not dare to touch your children&#8230;\u201d</p>\n<p>The MLA alleged that police had \u201cno evidence against Sami\u201d, adding, \u201cI was told by police that he is involved in influencing the youth to join anti-national forces. An atmosphere of terror is being created. All of you have to fight against it. I will, very soon, ask you to come and hold protests to seek the release of Sami and you have to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>On defending Sami at the event, the MLA said, \u201cI asked the gathering to demonstrate against the injustice done to Sami. It is our constitutional right. Whoever speaks out against the Modi government becomes an anti-national. But it is our right to do so and also to hold peaceful demonstrations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Defending Singh, AAP leader and spokesperson Sanjay Singh said, \u201cThough I would insist that one choose one\u2019s words carefully, what Amanatullah said holds true. Literally the word ha&#8230;&#8230;. means jo ha&#8230; ka khaata ho. Though it might sound offensive and a better word could have been used, it is not entirely unjustified. The government has harassed the Delhi government so much that our legislators are offended and therefore tend to react sharply,\u201d said Singh.</p>\n<p>The AAP leader added, \u201cOur leaders are still better behaved as compared to those from the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>. The hate speech by Ram Shankar Katheria in Agra is outright offensive and if any of our MLAs said anything like that, they (BJP) would have hanged us.\u201d</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2691809&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/aap-mla-uses-derogatory-language-against-modi-govt/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/aap-mla-khan-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/aap-mla-khan-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aap-mla-KHAN-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/aap-mla-khan-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aap, aap mla, aap news, aap mla khan, aap mla against modi govt, narendra modi, delhi news, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Power situation in MP: Under Cong rule, people stayed in underpants, says CM Chouhan</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/power-situation-in-madhya-pradesh-under-congress-rule-people-stayed-in-underpants-says-cm-chouhan/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/power-situation-in-madhya-pradesh-under-congress-rule-people-stayed-in-underpants-says-cm-chouhan/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2016 00:56:30 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2016 00:58:11 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Milind Ghatwai]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2691677</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The CM was replying to the debate on motion of thanks to the Governor\u2019s address. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2691677&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2691684 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/chouhan-mp-assembly-759.jpg\" alt=\"Chouhan, madhya pradesh, madhya pradesh cm, cm Chouhan, mp cm Chouhan, madhya pradesh govt, mp govt, mp assembly, madhya pradesh assembly, madhya pradesh news, india news\" /> Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan speaks in the Assembly, in Bhopal on Tuesday. (PTI Photo)\n<p>Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had his Assembly colleagues in splits as he claimed that the power situation in Bhopal during the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> rule was so bad that people were forced to roam around in their underpants.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe people were so helpless that they used to move around in their underpants. You have all seen it. They would take off their vests,\u2019\u2019 Chouhan said Tuesday while claiming that under the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>, state\u2019s power generation had reached 16116 MW from 2900 MW towards the end of the Congress rule.</p>\n<p>The CM was replying to the debate on motion of thanks to the Governor\u2019s address. Refuting charges that Centre had cut funding to the state, Chouhan said double-digit growth rate and the agriculture growth rate of 20 to 24 per cent was the hallmark of BJP rule.</p>\n<p>He added that the state will spend Rs 1500 crore for Narmada\u2019s purification.<br />\nLeader of Opposition Bala Bachchan, however, said that the state\u2019s financial condition was grim and communal tension on the rise. He also alleged that business tycoons, who were part of the official delegation to Singapore, were raided by the Income Tax department. While the CM did not make any reference to the I-T raids in his speech, he refuted allegations of communal strife, calling the state an \u201cisland of peace\u201d.

(PTI Photo)\n<p>Seeking permission to move a breach of privilege motion against HRD Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/smriti-irani/\">Smriti Irani</a>, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> MP K C Venugopal Monday gave a notice to <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and contended that Irani misled the House and the nation on the issue of government intervention in Delhi\u2019s JNU and the Hyderabad Central University while intervening in a debate on the topic last week.</p>\n<p>While Venugopal cited five instances to back his contention, CPM MP Mohammed Salim is also likely to give a privilege notice against Irani. The party\u2019s general secretary, Sitaram Yechury said, \u201cIf the privilege notice is not accepted in Lok Sabha, the party plans to give a notice in Rajya Sabha, of which Smriti Irani is a member.\u201d</p>\n<p>In his notice, Venugopal challenged Irani\u2019s statement that a doctor was not allowed near PhD scholar <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/topic/rohith-suicide-case/\">Rohith Vemula</a> after he allegedly hanged himself in a university hostel room on January 17. The Congress MP said the university\u2019s chief medical officer has countered Irani\u2019s claim, and that \u201csecurity officials found the body in the hostel room and she (the CMO) got a call around 7.20 pm and rushed to the hostel to examine the body\u201d.</p>\n<p>The CMO, he pointed out, has also said that by the time she reached, the body had been removed from the ceiling fan and within 10 minutes the student was declared dead. Venugopal said the doctor has claimed to have informed the Vice Chancellor immediately. The V-C, in turn, asked her whether there was any possibility of reviving Vemula, the MP said, adding that the minister\u2019s statement is \u201chighly contradictory\u201d.</p>\n<p>The second instance cited by Venugopal was regarding Irani\u2019s claim that a book by social activist Teesta Seetalvad and commissioned by Kapil Sibal, the HRD Minister during the previous UPA regime, was being taught in class IV in Mumbai\u2019s Don Bosco School. Stating that this claim has been countered by the school itself, Venugopal cited <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a>\u2019s interview with the school principal, Father Bernard Fernandes, in which he said the handbook was discontinued way back in 2001.</p>\n<p>Venugopal also said the student who organised the Mahishasur Martyrdom Day in JNU has denied that the statement Irani had quoted in Parliament was released either by him or his colleagues who organised the event.</p>\n<p>The Congress MP also countered Irani\u2019s statement about the release of fellowship stipend to Vemula and her claim that the proctorial board, which decided to expel Vemula and four other Dalit scholars of HCU, had representation from the SC/ST community. Venugopal said it has been reported that there was no SC/ST member on this board.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is gross violation of rules of the House and blatant misuse of constitutional powers as a minister,\u201d the Congress MP said, adding that the minister deliberately hid truths.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2690154&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/cong-mp-venugopal-gives-privilege-notice-against-smriti-irani/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/smriti-irani-budget-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/smriti-irani-budget-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Smriti-Irani-budget-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/smriti-irani-budget-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">smriti, motion against smriti, smriti irani, rohith vemula, smriti irani speech, parliament, budget session, budget session news, congress, india news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Protesters pelt stones at Arvind Kejriwal&#8217;s car in Ludhiana</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/arvind-kejriwal-car-attacked-stones-ludhiana/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/arvind-kejriwal-car-attacked-stones-ludhiana/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 03:24:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 03:51:56 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kanchan Vasdev]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2689152</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Arvind Kejriwal later said that his car was attacked by sticks and stones and that Akali Dal and Congress were nervous.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2689152&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2689188 size-medium\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/kejriwal1.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"Arvind Kejriwal, Arvind Kejriwal attacked, Arvind Kejriwal car attacked, \" /> <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/arvind-kejriwal/\">Arvind Kejriwal</a> later said that his car was attacked by sticks and stones and that Akali Dal and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> were nervous.\n<p>On the last leg of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s five-day Punjab tour, a mob pelted his vehicle with stones at Hassanpur village near here, breaking its windscreen.

We were in power, he was part of the government. He could have taken up the matter at the appropriate forum then,\u201d M Veerappa Moily, senior Congress leader and Chidambaram\u2019s colleague in the UPA cabinet, told The Sunday Express.<br />\nFormer law minister Ashwani Kumar said, \u201cIn my personal view, the debate on this issue, at this point of time, is fruitless. It is inadvisable and unnecessary to raise the issue afresh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pointing out that BJP\u2019s Anurag Thakur had raised the issue in Parliament on Friday, Leader of Congress in <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/\">Lok Sabha</a> Mallikarjun Kharge said, \u201cChidambaram was in the government&#8230; and it was the government\u2019s decision. Now he has given his opinion. But as far as I am concerned, it is neither the opinion of the party nor of the then government. And there is no question of regretting it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sources close to Chidambaram, however, said the reaction is a misreading of his remarks, which were meant to only underline the fact that citizens have the freedom to hold an honest opinion and disagree with the decision to execute Afzal. They said that nowhere in the interview does Chidambaram say it is his opinion. In his interview to The Economic Times, Chidambaram had said, \u201cI think it is possible to hold an honest opinion that the Afzal Guru case was perhaps not correctly decided&#8230; But being in government you cannot say the court has decided the case wrongly because it was the government that prosecuted him. But an independent person can hold an opinion that the case was not decided correctly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chidambaram was Union Home Minister from November 29, 2008, to July 31, 2012, while Afzal was hanged on February 9, 2013.</p>\n<p>At the launch of his book, Standing Guard \u2014 A Year in Opposition, on Friday, Chidambaram had touched upon the aspect of free speech, saying that universities are not monasteries and that \u201ca university is a place where I, as a student, at my age, has the right to be wrong\u201d. He went on point out that debates are being framed in a perverse manner these days.</p>\n<p>Kharge\u2019s remarks, however, reveal the unease among the Congress leaders. When a question on Chidambaram\u2019s remarks was put to Congress\u2019s communication department head Randeep Surjewala Friday, he did not suggest it was his personal opinion but focussed on arguing that it was the UPA government which pursued the case and demanded that Afzal be handed the harshest punishment.</p>\n<p>Both Moily and Kumar said Afzal\u2019s case has \u201cattained judicial finality\u201d with the apex court judgement. \u201cThe Supreme Court decision has attained judicial finality and whatever may be the personal opinion of individuals, the decision is the law of the land&#8230;,\u201d Kumar said.</p>\n<p>Moily said reopening the matter will \u201cembarrass the judiciary, the legal system and the entire system of government\u201d. \u201cEnough time was given to him (Afzal) to file a mercy petition. Reopening such matters will be reflecting on courts,\u201d he said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2686772&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/disquiet-in-congress-over-chidambarams-afzal-guru-remarks/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/chidambaram-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/chidambaram-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">chidambaram-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/chidambaram-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Chidambaram, afzal guru, Chidambaram afzal guru, afzal guru chidambaram, congress, Chidambaram congress, Chidambaram remarks, Congress news, INdia news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Partition, Babri, now, our most polarised years: Chidambaram</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/hidambaram-book-launch-jnu-gst/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/hidambaram-book-launch-jnu-gst/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2016 03:30:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2016 03:40:12 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ashutosh Bhardwaj]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2685280</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[At the launch of his new book, Chidambaram spoke on the JNU debate and GST Bill. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2685280&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2685667 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/chidambaram-759.jpg\" alt=\"Chidambaram, JNU row, Chidambaram JNU, JNU chidambaram, Chidambaram book, Standing Guard Chidamabaram, India news\" /> P <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/columnist/p-chidambaram/\">Chidambaram</a>, speaking at the launch of his book Standing Guard \u2014 A Year in Opposition, in Delhi Friday. (Express Photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi)\n<p>There have been only \u201cthree occasions,\u201d when India has been most \u201cpolarised,\u201d said former Union Finance Minister and Home Minister P Chidambaram: the Partition, the demolition of the Babri Masjid and now.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many of us realise how polarised the Indian society has become? Please talk to your Muslim friends, please talk to your Dalit friends. Please talk to people who have small farmholdings,\u201d Chidambaram said, adding that there exists \u201cgreat insecurity, great apprehension\u201d among the poor, the marginalised. \u201cWe are heading towards a deeply divided and polarised society. How did this happen in one year?\u201d</p>\n<p>Speaking at the launch of Standing Guard \u2014 A Year in Opposition, a collection of his 51 columns in <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a> and The Sunday Express (published by Rupa and part of the Express Book Series), Chidambaram said that in just one year, the narrative of this Government had dramatically changed from one of development to one of division.</p>\n<p>His observations came days after HRD Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/smriti-irani/\">Smriti Irani</a> defended the government action in the JNU in Parliament. In an apparent counter to Irani, Chidambaram said: \u201cWhat do we understand by a university? The university is not a monastery. We are confusing between universities and monasteries. A university is a place, where I, as a student, at my age, has the right to be wrong,\u201d he said, adding that in a university there is no need to always be profound as \u201cI can be ridiculous also\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are we framing debate in the country? Please reflect on the manner, the perverse manner in which debates are being framed,\u201d the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> leader said.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at how the debate is being framed today,\u201d Chidambaram said. \u201cThe debate in Dadri was not whether the man had beef or buffalo meat or mutton in his house. That is how the debate is being framed. The real issue was whether the mob had any right to lynch a person. The debate in Hyderabad central university is being framed as was he (<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/topic/rohith-suicide-case/\">Rohith Vemula</a>) a Dalit or not a Dalit. The real debate is how an insensitive university drove a first-generation learner from an underprivileged family to commit a suicide. The debate in JNU is not whether a bunch of misguided youths allegedly raised some anti-national slogans. The debate is what is a university?\u201d</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2685665 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/pc-book-launch.jpg\" alt=\"Chidambaram, JNU row, Chidambaram JNU, JNU chidambaram, Chidambaram book, Standing Guard Chidamabaram, India news\" /> Manmohan Singh, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a>, Sitaram Yechury and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/shashi-tharoor/\">Shashi Tharoor</a> at the book launch. (Express Photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi)\n<p>Chidambaram was part of a panel that discussed his book and his columns. Former J&amp;K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, sociologist Shiv Visvanathan and former diplomat Pavan K Verma were the panelists. The discussion was moderated by policy analyst Sanjaya Baru.</p>\n<p>Underlining the importance of standing guard in a democracy, Chidambaram, to much applause, quoted poet Thiruvalluvar: \u201cA king without a critic will fall even if he has no enemies. A king must embrace his critic. A king must listen to his critic. A king must welcome his critic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chidambaram said that in his first column of 2015, he had written that 2014 was the year of acrimony, \u201c2015 promises to be the year of acronyms\u201d. \u201cToday, at the end of the year I am afraid\u201d, as it turned out to be a \u201cyear of deep polarisation\u201d.</p>\n<p>He noted that when he had begun the column Across the Aisle in The Sunday Express in January 2014, he had \u201cdecided to write mainly on economics, but as the year went by the narrative has changed so dramatically, that there are fewer columns on economics and more columns on other issues.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is what worries me, that how this narrative has changed for the worse dramatically in such a short time. Was it an intended change? Or was it an unintended change? Is it just madness or is there a method to this madness?\u201d he said. \u201cThe year did not end with a narrative dominated by the economy. It ended on a completely different narrative. Instead of a rise in economy, we have a rise in intolerance. Instead of a narrative of cooperation, we have a narrative of confrontation,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The panelists commented on what they said was the government\u2019s tendency these days to see the Opposition and dissenters as an \u201cenemy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Verma said that if the Government was really serious about GST, it should have had \u201cstructured negotiations\u201d which it has not and is now blaming the Opposition for not passing it. To which Chidambaram said that it was a flawed bill and the flaws needed to be fixed before it was passed.</p>\n<p>Omar Abdullah expressed his concern at growing intolerance and said that \u201cit\u2019s extremely unfortunate that the number of institutions or organisations willing to call out the government on facts is limited to a handful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noting that \u201cany government requires an opposition\u201d, he said that \u201cthe current government has very conveniently packaged everybody who opposes this government as anti-national. Being in an opposition to this government does not mean being an opposition to the nation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noting that we \u201cnow confuse the opposition with the enemy\u201d, he also advised the Congress that if it \u201cseeks to replace the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> with itself in another two and a half year or three years time, along with the criticism it now needs to start offering alternatives.\u201d</p>\n<p>Visvanathan highlighted the \u201cethical nature of the book\u201d and said the chapter on the revocation of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act \u201craises questions of ethics in a fascinating way\u201d. \u201cEthics is an art of balancing the two improbables,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Verma pointed to a column in which Chidambaram had predicted the impact of the Bihar elections. \u201cYou said a defeat in Bihar will have a sobering effect on Mr Modi and the BJP, they will pause and step back,\u201d Verma said, adding, to laughter, that it was a rare occasion when Chidambaram was proved wrong.</p>\n<p>Baru posed a few questions to Chidambaram and said that since his first book was \u201cA View From the Outside\u201d, the next one was anticipated to be \u201cA View from the Inside\u201d. He asked the former minister to reflect on what kind of a book he would have written had he been \u201cStanding Guard\u201d inside the government as the home minister in the UPA. \u201cIf you had been standing guard effectively, would there have been a change of the party (at the Centre)\u201d, he asked.</p>\n<p>Among those in the audience were former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/\">Sonia Gandhi</a>\u2019s political secretary Ahmed Patel, CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, former Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Justice B N Srikrishna, Congress leader Kapil Sibal and former National Security Advisor Shivshanker Menon.</p>\n<p>Earlier, welcoming the audience, Anant Goenka, Wholetime Director and Head, New Media, said that The Indian Express has been a natural home to those who stand guard. And Chidambaram\u2019s columns were one of the most incisive critiques of this government. \u201cWhen a government loses elections, The Indian Express gains star columnists. I will be honest to mention that we will be delighted if Mr Chidambaram continues to be across the aisle writing for us.\u201d Publisher Kapish Mehra said that this was one of the most honest and prescient books of non-fiction that he had read and published.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2685280&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/hidambaram-book-launch-jnu-gst/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/chidambaram-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/chidambaram-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Chidambaram-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837cd894d0f238e52cce2370f8f193c?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">12ananya</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/chidambaram-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Chidambaram, JNU row, Chidambaram JNU, JNU chidambaram, Chidambaram book, Standing Guard Chidamabaram, India news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/pc-book-launch.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Chidambaram, JNU row, Chidambaram JNU, JNU chidambaram, Chidambaram book, Standing Guard Chidamabaram, India news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>\u2018Minister shouldn\u2019t have read pamphlet in House\u2019</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/smriti-irani-shouldnt-have-read-pamphlet-in-house/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/smriti-irani-shouldnt-have-read-pamphlet-in-house/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2016 02:40:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2016 02:40:36 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Liz Mathew]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2685614</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Varaprasad Rao Velagapalli, Tirupati MP and a YSR Congress party leader, speaks on the \u2018Mahishasur Martyrdom Day\u2019 issue<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2685614&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2685617\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/varaprasad-rao-759.jpg\" alt=\"Varaprasad Rao Velagapalli, Tirupati MP\" /> Varaprasad Rao Velagapalli, Tirupati MP\n<p><strong>What is your view on the HRD Minister raising \u2018Mahishasur Martyrdom Day\u2019 in Parliament?</strong></p>\n<p>The minister should not have read out the pamphlet in the House. If some people, whoever they are, have written something crazy, why should the minister give it publicity? The intention was wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you agree with the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>, which said it was blasphemous?</strong></p>\n<p>The issue should not have been discussed at all. She did not conduct an inquiry on who issued the pamphlets.</p>\n<p><strong>India cannot be monolithic. Demons in popular versions of epics could be worshipped in other places. What is your view on raising such issues in Parliament?</strong></p>\n<p>It is not proper. Even in the national-anti national debate, how is one anti-national? As long as one is not doing any unlawful activity, speaking one\u2019s view is allowed in a democratic set-up. I may like to say I like Saddam Hussain or Nawaz Sharif. These students did not say what Afzal Guru said was right. Kashmiris have been demanding azadi because it was a promise by Jawaharlal Nehru, that there would be a referendum. So why do you take those students seriously?</p>\n<p><strong>By raising the issue, was the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> trying to please the majority?</strong></p>\n<p>The BJP is just diverting attention. In the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/topic/rohith-suicide-case/\">Rohith Vemula</a> case also, they accused some of being anti-national.

Ishrat and her accomplices were killed in an encounter in 2004, which Modi\u2019s critics claim was staged.</p>\n<p>Calling it a \u201ca conspiracy to put in dock political rivals\u201d by the UPA government, Thakur asked, \u201cWho changed the affidavit at the political level, the nation wants to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Hamirpur MP also referred to Chidambaram\u2019s latest position that Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru\u2019s case \u201cwas perhaps not correctly decided\u201d. He pointed out that Chidambaram had been quoted in an interview saying that he felt it was possible to hold an honest opinion that there were \u201cgrave doubts about the extent of his (Guru\u2019s) involvement\u201d in the 2001 attack on Parliament House.</p>\n<p>CPI(M) member M B Rajesh also tried to speak, arguing that he had given a notice, but Speaker Sumitra Mahajan disallowed him. His party colleagues and other Opposition members lent their support to Rajesh by alleging that Mahajan was selectively permitting people to speak, but the Speaker moved on to the next item.</p>\n<p>Earlier, Congress floor leader Mallikarjun Kharge got up to make the point that the Speaker had expunged many words from Congress chief whip Jyotiraditya Scindia\u2019s speech on Wednesday, which referred to the RSS, Nathuram Godse and Delhi BJP MLA O P Sharma, who allegedly attacked a CPI activist outside Patiala House courts recently. But, Kharge said, Mahajan had not deleted the \u201cderogatory\u201d remarks about Congress president <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/\">Sonia Gandhi</a> and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a>.

The annual return also refers to a Rs 20 lakh loan from Keshav Kunj, which is the name of RSS headquarters in Delhi, he said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2685529&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/congress-calls-for-sacking-of-maharashtra-minister-vinod-tawde/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/vinod-tawde-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/vinod-tawde-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Vinod-tawde-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/vinod-tawde-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Vinod Tawde, Maharashtra, Maharashtra minister, Maharashtra bjp minister, Vinod Tawde news, Vinod Tawde controversy, Vinod tawde news, Maharashtra news, India news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Manmohan Singh&#8217;s Gujarat visit called off citing &#8216;security reasons&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/manmohan-singh-gujarat-amit-shah-godhra/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/manmohan-singh-gujarat-amit-shah-godhra/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2016 00:56:57 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2016 01:12:30 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2685162</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[On the day Manmohan was supposed to arrive in Gujarat, Amit Shah will be attending a grand felicitation ceremony in his honour. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2685162&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2514280 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/10/manmohan-singh-express.jpg\" alt=\"PM modi, narendra modi, manmohan singh, sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi, beef ban, congress, modi contacts, eltablish contacts, modi contact with sonia gandhi, parliament, india news\" /> Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh speaking at an event.

(Source: Express photo)\" /> <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> workers protest over the JNU issue in Jalandhar Wednesday. (Source: Express photo)\n<p>A DAY before Delhi CM <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/arvind-kejriwal/\">Arvind Kejriwal</a>\u2019s visit to Punjab, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) state convener Sucha Singh Chhotepur has said that the ruling alliance of SAD-BJP and the party in the opposition, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a>, were scared of the fame of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Chhotepur was reacting to statements of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Capt Amarinder Singh against Kejriwal, the national convenor of AAP.</p>\n<p>Badal had called Kejriwal, who begins his five-day Punjab tour from Sangrur on Thursday, a \u201cseasonal bird\u201d and the PPCC president had said Kejriwal should fulfill at least 50 per cent of his promises in Delhi, before visiting Punjab.</p>\n<p>Defending Kejriwal, Chhotepur said,\u201dCM Parkash Singh Badal and his deputy should tell us what promises they have fulfilled. The Badals and Amarinder get inferiority complex the moment they hear the name of Arvind Kejriwal and their statements show that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He added, \u201cThe Delhi CM has never asked why the Badals visit Delhi so frequently while Punjab has so many problems. Even Amarinder keeps on visiting Delhi. \u201c</p>\n<p>Kejriwal will fly to Chandigarh on Thursday. During his visit, he is scheduled to meet distressed families of farmers who committed suicide due to farm crisis, families of drug addicts ruined after their menfolk got hooked to drugs, victims of law and order failure, including the Abohar-based Dalit who was murdered, women, traders and industrialists, who are suffering due to flight of industry driven away by environment prevailing in state.</p>\n<p>He said, \u201cAs part of the five-day tour, Kejriwal will directly interact with the masses. Based on the feedback, we will set the agenda in our election manifesto.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kejriwal is scheduled to visit Ferozepur, Faridkot, Khadoor Sahib, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Fategarh Sahib and Patiala districts. Kejriwal will visit Sangrur and Maur village where a poverty stricken couple had committed suicide. In Chhajli village he will interact with families of over 30 farmers reported to have committed suicide.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe villagers have been duped of over Rs 100 crore by chit fund companies. The villagers had taken this money as bank loans by mortgaging land or houses. They are getting possession notices from banks. So far, the villagers have not got their money back,\u201d said Sukhjinder Sangha, AAP leader from Sangrur.</p>\n<p>Kejriwal would meet widows of those who committed suicide due to debt and farm losses at Leel Kalan village, and address shopkeepers in Sunam before proceeding to Mansa and Talwandi Sabo villages. The Delhi CM will next visit Bathinda where cotton crop of farmers was damaged. He will visit Abohar to meet the family of the murdered Dalit Bheem Taank and later address farmers in Fazilka.</p>\n<p>On February 27, he will be in Taran Tarn and Amritsar villages, and on February 28, in Jalandhar. He will conclude his tour at Ludhiana and Fatehgarh Sahib where he will meet industrialists of Ludhiana and Mandi Gobindgarh, according to Chhotepur.</p>\n<p>\u201cHis visit is high on symbolism. We want to convey a message that AAP is taking seriously all these issues concerning the state. Kejriwal will personally meet the victims\u2019 families. The victims of crimes pointing at law and order failures have been identified. His itinerary has been chalked out after thoroughly studying the scenario,\u201d said a senior AAP leader.</p>\n<p>His meetings with industrialists have been organised in Batala, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mandi Gobindgarh and Sangrur.</p>\n<p>During the campaign, the party would take up issues facing people and not Panthic or religious issues. The Congress had earlier levelled allegations that AAP was siding with radicals to drive seculars and Hindus away from the party.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will be introducing Punjab Bolda Hai in March.

Incidentally NCRB functions under Rajnath\u2019s own ministry.</p>\n<p>O\u2019Brien, meanwhile, has had one of the most meteoric rises in the Trinamool organisation ever since the estrangement of Roy and Mamata, apparently over Roy\u2019s deposition to the CBI in the Saradha chit fund case in February 2015. O\u2019Brien replaced Roy as the leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha, and led a very combative party before his leader met PM Modi and called a truce. The first overtures of reconciliation with Roy, too, had come from O\u2019Brien when they were seen eating soup in the Central Hall of Parliament. Before that, for months, Roy had been persona non grata for Trinamool MPs.</p>\n<p>Now, while it is Roy\u2019s lot to liaison one on one with political leaders, O\u2019Brien, who had performed that role in bringing Mamata and Delhi CM <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/arvind-kejriwal/\">Arvind Kejriwal</a> together, is now essentially the public face of the party at the national level \u2014 although he will obviously play second fiddle to Mamata when she chooses to step out of the state. O\u2019Brien visited Hyderabad University in the wake of <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/topic/rohith-suicide-case/\">Rohith Vemula</a>\u2019s suicide and has been interacting extensively with students in elite colleges across the country including a programme in SRCC Delhi.</p>\n<p>Roy\u2019s responsibility is tying the Delhi ends of the West Bengal electoral process.

Party national secretary Shrikant Sharma said the video clipping circulated and exhibited by BJP spokespersons was broadcast by various news channels. \u201cTelevision channels have shown these videos. All evidences were submitted in court. The matter is sub judice,\u201d Sharma said.</p>\n<p>However, he added: \u201cYou have freedom of speech, but no one should cross the Lakshman rekha. Those slogans against India raised on the campus were unfortunate. More unfortunate was the political support they got.

(PTI Photo)\n<p>Facing constant attack from the ruling party at Centre for supporting \u201canti-nationals\u201d over ongoing JNU row, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> vice-president Rahul Gandhi Friday hit back saying \u201cpatriotism\u201d runs in his blood and he does not need any certificate from RSS and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a>. He said neither he nor the Congress and its president were afraid of Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a>, who \u201cdoesn\u2019t speak truth, doesn\u2019t fulfil promises\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cRashtrabhakti mere khoon me hai (Patriotism is in my blood)&#8230;32 bullets were fired at (grandmother) Indira Gandhi and my father (Rajiv Gandhi) was also assassinated for the cause of this country. My family has taught me lessons in patriotism&#8230;we have not learnt anything else. So I do not need any certificate from RSS or BJP,\u201d Rahul said in Amethi.</p>\n<p>Addressing a series of meetings here, the Congress leader kept attacking Modi and said a situation has come in the country where attempts are being made to suppress all voices of dissent.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, whoever speaks against Modiji, is being threatened. But neither me, nor the Congress or its president are afraid of him. We are going to form government in every state now. People of Bihar rejected him. People of Assam are going to do the same, and then in 2019, people of the entire country will reject him,\u201d he said at a public meeting in Salon area of Amethi.</p>\n<p>Asking people to remember that \u201cNarendra Modi does not speak the truth and fails to fulfil promises\u201d, Rahul targeted the BJP government at Centre for rising prices of pulses and failing to bring back the black money. \u201cWe are going to fight for the rights of poor and if he (Modi) cannot fulfil his promises, then he should step out of the way,\u201d Rahul said addressing locals in Suchi village.</p>\n<p>Making light of Modi\u2019s flagship project Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Rahul said, \u201cHe is running clean India campaign but his own constituency, as per a recent survey, is among the lowest ranked cities in terms of cleanliness. His constituency is the dirtiest\u201d.</p>\n<p>Telling people that Modi has suddenly remembered farmers and is now holding rally for them, the Congress leader pointed out that \u201cPM took a selfie with Obama but never with a farmer, labourer or an unemployed youth\u201d. Rahul asked \u201cwhat development works have been done by the Modi government\u201d and claimed that \u201cinstead of the poor the central government was working for the industrialists\u201d.</p>\n<p>He even hit out at the \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign saying, \u201cask them, if the produce generated by farmers is not made in India\u201d.</p>\n<p>In a marked change from his earlier visit when he used to say that his hands are tied up as Congress does not have government in Uttar Pradesh or Centre, Rahul this time asked masses to come to him with their problems and he will try to solve them and even put pressure on the governments.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do not have governments (in UP or Centre) but still we will pressurise those in power. I will try to help as much as I can but for better performance you will have to bring Congress government in UP in 2017,\u201d he repeated at almost every meeting and chaupal that he held .</p>\n<p>During the day he had tea at the house of a Dalit, visited a local temple and inspected a MGNREGA work site.<br />\n\u2018SP, BSP represent particular section\u2019</p>\n<p>Addressing chaupals in Amethi, Rahul accused the Samajwadi Party and BSP of \u201crepresenting\u201d a \u201cparticular\u201d section of the society and said this was the reason why Uttar Pradesh was \u201clagging behind\u201d in development. \u201cThe governments that are formed in Uttar Pradesh belong to a particular section of society and this is why the state has lagged behind in the race of development\u201d, he told presidents of gram sabhas here.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Mulayam Singh comes to power, he forms government of a particular section&#8230;Mayawati comes and she also makes government of another section&#8230;the state is not going to benefit from this,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthough people say that the Congress has been weakened in the state, but this is not the fact and they need to come to Rae Bareli and Amethi to see this\u201d.</p>\n<p>Exuding confidence that Congress will come to power in the state, he charged the Centre with attempting to snatch development of Amethi.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter taking away the mega food park and Hindustan paper mill, they now want to take away the Rajiv Gandhi institute of information technology and the workers need to remain prepared for it,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Congress leader continued to face protests over lending support to the JNU agitation. ABVP workers tried to disrupt his entry into his constituency by waving black flags and asking him to go back. More than a dozen activists of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the BJP\u2019s youth wing, were rounded up while some were taken into custody by the district police for raising slogans against the Congress leader, Inspector in-charge S K Mishra said. He added that the decision to release the BJYM workers will be taken later. BJP youth wing leader Sudhanshu Shukla alleged that some Congress workers clashed with them. Later in the day, some BJP activists, led by district leader Chandra Mauli Singh, burnt an effigy of Rahul Gandhi.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2675097&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/patriotism-in-my-blood-dont-need-certificate-from-rss-bjp-rahul/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/rahul-amethi-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/rahul-amethi-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Rahul-amethi-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad19eff6049dd5571c755a3dacf699fc?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">namithans</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/rahul-amethi-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Rahul Gandhi, RSS, JNU, JNUSU, Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, Sedition, Anti national, narendra modi, Jawaharlal nehru university, Congress, BJP</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Kanhaiya Kumar arrest: Define sedition, show evidence &#8211; Nitish to PM Modi</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/jnusu-president-arrest-define-sedition-show-evidence-nitish-to-pm/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/jnusu-president-arrest-define-sedition-show-evidence-nitish-to-pm/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2016 01:15:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2016 11:01:01 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Santosh Singh]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2675093</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[He said the MHA has not been able to produce evidence against Kanhaiya nearly a week after arresting him.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2675093&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2464206 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/08/nitish-kumar-759.jpg\" alt=\"Nitish Kumar, Narendra Modi, Kanhaiya Kumar, JNUSU, JNU, JNU controversy, sedition, anti-national, umar khalid, hafiz saeed, afzal guru\" /> Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar\n<p>Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Friday slammed the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> government for living under an \u201cillusion\u201d of patriotism and arresting JNU students union president Kanhaiya Kumar without evidence to divert the country\u2019s attention from core issues on which the government has come a cropper.</p>\n<p>Speaking to reporters here, Nitish said: \u201cNeither the MHA nor the Delhi Police has been able to produce any evidence of <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/\">sedition</a> against Kanhaiya Kumar. If they have any proof, it should be presented. People sitting at the Centre must not be under the illusion that they alone are patriots. There are patriots in every party, and no party can stand by traitors. The PM should define (the meaning of) sedition.\u201d</p>\n<p>He said the MHA has not been able to produce evidence against Kanhaiya nearly a week after arresting him. \u201cSedition charges can be levelled only with adequate evidence,\u201d he said, and accused the NDA government of \u201cdigressing from development and economic issues and engaging in emotional issues\u201d.</p>\n<p>The CM pointed out that the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> formed the government in Jammu and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/\">Kashmir</a> with the PDP, which had demanded the release of Afzal Guru, who was executed in the Parliament attack case. \u201cCan they tell us what kind of patriotism was it to join hands with a party that carried out a sustained campaign demanding the release of Afzal Guru? Ye kaun sa deshbhakti ka paimana hai (What standard of patriotism is this?)\u201d.</p>\n<p>According to the police, Kanhaiya Kumar was among the group of students that had raised slogans in favour of Afzal Guru and Pakistan. Videos coming out of the university so far, however, have not been able to prove Kanhaiya was part of any such gathering.</p>\n<p>The reason the government is doing all this, Nitish said, is that the NDA rode to power on popular promises but has \u201cfailed miserably on economic fronts\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe number of people not subscribing to the BJP\u2019s (Hindutva) ideology is increasing (on JNU campus), so&#8230;they are out to destroy JNU and its traditions. Let them get evidence (of sedition against any student) and not try to create an atmosphere of confusion by raising emotional issues and digress from basic issues,\u201d Nitish said. Taking a dig at the BJP, which has been claiming that Bihar is returning to \u201cjungle raj\u201d, as seen under the RJD, Nitish said such is the sorry state of affairs in Delhi, where the police is under the MHA\u2019s jurisdiction, that the Supreme Court had to send its team following attacks on Kanhaiya in Patiala House courts. \u201cThings are not improving in Delhi.<br />\nMay I know where jungle raj prevails? Their actions (violence by lawyers allegedly close to the BJP) in court premises do not reflect any patriotism.\u201d</p>\n<p>JD(U) state spokesperson Neeraj Kumar has already visited Kanhaiya\u2019s parents at their village, Bihat in Begusarai.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2675093&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/jnusu-president-arrest-define-sedition-show-evidence-nitish-to-pm/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/08/nitish-kumar4801.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/08/nitish-kumar4801.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">nitish-kumar480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad19eff6049dd5571c755a3dacf699fc?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">namithans</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/nitish-kumar-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Nitish Kumar, Narendra Modi, Kanhaiya Kumar, JNUSU, JNU, JNU controversy, sedition, anti-national, umar khalid, hafiz saeed, afzal guru</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Arunachal Pradesh gets a new CM, Kalikho Pul sworn in at night</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/kalikho-pul-sworn-in-as-arunachal-cm-as-bjp-backs-congress-faction/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/kalikho-pul-sworn-in-as-arunachal-cm-as-bjp-backs-congress-faction/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2016 00:27:07 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2016 09:45:14 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Samudra Gupta Kashyap]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2675077</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Pul\u2019s swearing in came a day after the Supreme Court vacated its order of maintaining status quo in the state, thus paving the way for installation of a new government.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2675077&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2675080 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/kalikho-pul-lead.jpg\" alt=\"Arunachal crisis, Kalikho pul, arunachal pradesh, AP chief minister, nabam tuki, congress govt arunachal, Supreme court, Congress BJP alliance, Arunachal government\" /> Dissident <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> leader Kalikho Pul sworn in as Chief Minister of crisis-ridden Arunachal Pradesh by Governor J P Rajkhowa in Itanagar on Friday.

On Friday, the Supreme Court rejected the plea of Congress leaders seeking direction that it be allowed to go in for a floor test in the assembly to prove majority.</p>\n<p>Pul has the support of only 18 of the 45 Congress MLAs in the assembly. But 13 opposition MLAs \u2014 two Independents and 11 from the BJP \u2014 have given in writing to the Governor that they back him. Arunachal Pradesh Congress Committee president Padi Richo, however, said Tuki is still the Congress Legislative Party leader with 25 MLAs supporting him, and that the 19 dissidents have ceased to be Congress members.</p>\n<p>Pul belongs to the Kaman Mishmi community, which has about 2,500 members in Anjaw district, which shares the international boundary with China.</p>\n<p>Pul\u2019s rise to the post of Chief Minister was preceded by a series of developments, which began with the Governor summoning the state assembly without consulting the cabinet and the Speaker in December last year. While the opposition BJP had moved an impeachment motion against the Speaker, he refused to let the opposition and the dissident Congress faction enter the Assembly premises.

This prompted the Speaker and the Congress Legislature Party to move the Gauhati High Court, with the issue finally landing before a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court has finally cleared the way for a new government to be installed in Itanagar in the next two days. The court Thursday also upheld a stay order of the Gauhati High Court of December 2015 against disqualification of 14 dissident Congress MLAs, clearing the decks for for Pul\u2019s swearing in. The Congress, which is still with the Nabam Tuki faction, made its last attempt Wednesday, before the court\u2019s ruling Thursday cleared all hurdles before Pul.</p>\n<p>Pul, a father of five sons, belongs to a very small community called Kaman Mishmi, which has hardly 2,500 members. An MLA from Hayuliang in Anjaw district in eastern Arunachal that shares a boundary with China, Pul has been a minister for most of the time since he first arrived in 1995.</p>\n<p>He began as deputy minister for finance (1995-97), then became minister of state for power (1997-99), MoS for finance (1999-2002), MoS for land management (2002-03), and finally minister for finance (2003-05) before he was made chairman of a high-powered committee and simultaneously adviser to the CM for about a year. In 2006-09 he once again served as minister for finance, then minister for rural works (2009-11), and then health. Between 2011 and 2014, he was also made adviser to the CM, then again made a minister in 2014.</p>\n<p>Lasy year, reports emerged that Pul was engaged in a secret mission to topple Tuki. The then CM not only dropped him, but also saw to it that the Congress expelled him for anti-party activities in April. In less than a year, four more ministers reportedly began secretly meeting him, prompting Tuki to drop them too. That was October 2015, and as many as 21 Congress legislators had sided with Pul, leaving 26 with Tuki.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what finance is, and how funds have been misappropriated by Tuki and his close associates. Look at the condition of roads. Moreover, more than half the 880 hospitals and health centres across the state don\u2019t have doctors and nurses. Give me an opportunity, and I will not only set things right, but also see to it that those responsible for the mess are taken to task,\u201d Pul told <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a>.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2673374&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/arunachal-pradesh-supreme-court-kalikho-pul-congress-rebel-bjp-support/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/pul2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/pul2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">pul2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/pul1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Kalikho Pul, Arunachal Pradesh governement, Supreme court Arunachal Pradesh, </media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>\u2018Mamata\u2019s aversion to Left, poll concerns behind TMCP\u2019s silence over JNU row&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/mamata-banerjee-tmcp-jnu-row/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/mamata-banerjee-tmcp-jnu-row/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2016 08:56:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2016 08:56:05 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Aniruddha Ghosal]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2672427</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[TMC neither for nor against Centre, says students\u2019 wing leader<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2672427&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as several universities and student unions from across the country have joined in protest against the arrest of JNU Student Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on charges of <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/\">sedition</a>, the students\u2019 wing of the TMC, Trinamool <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> Chhatra Parishad (TMCP), which is in power in a majority of educational institutes in West Bengal, has said nothing so far on the issue. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has also refrained from commenting on the NDA government\u2019s handling of the protests.</p>\n<p>Describing its stance as \u2018neither for nor against\u2019 the anti-government protests over the JNU incident, sources within the Trinamool Congress said the reticence of the students\u2019 body is simply a result of the party supremo\u2019s abhorrence for \u201call things communist\u201d and the delicate situation before the upcoming Assembly elections in the state.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are neither for nor against what is happening. We condemn any arrest of students on fabricated charges or the clamp down of free speech and the freedom to express in universities. But at the same time, we are also against anything which is anti-national or seditious\u201d a TMCP activist said.</p>\n<p>Asked whether or not the TMCP was planning to organise any protests, he said, \u201cWe have no immediate plans, but we will let people know if anything is planned.\u201d</p>\n<p>TMCP\u2019s silence over the issue is in sharp contrast with its active protest after Dalit student <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/topic/rohith-suicide-case/\">Rohith Vemula</a> committed suicide. Not only had the student body organised a series of protest demanding justice, but the TMC leadership had sent party MP Derek O\u2019Brien to Hyderabad as well.</p>\n<p>A senior TMC leader said the reason behind this was party chief Mamata Banerjee\u2019s hatred of anything related to the Left Front. \u201cHer distaste for the Left and the ultra-Left student bodies is quite legendary. She had, in the past, severely cracked down on Jadavpur University student body leaders, who are associated with the Left. Had this been any other student body associated with a different party, she would have jumped at the chance to be critical of the Modi-led government,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>However, another section of the party maintained that ahead of Mamata\u2019s \u201cbrief, informal meeting\u201d with Prime Minister <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> on February 21, the West Bengal CM is deliberately softening her stance towards the NDA government at the Centre, while remaining critical of the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> in the state. \u201cWith the possibility of a CPM and Congress alliance hovering around the corner, political calculations in the country have changed. There are those in the BJP and TMC who believe that such an alliance will bring TMC closer to the NDA-led government. In such a situation, the BJP will need her support in the Upper House of the Parliament,\u201d said a TMC state committee leader.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2672427&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/mamata-banerjee-tmcp-jnu-row/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/mamata2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/mamata2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Mamata Banerjee in South Dinajpur</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a86a2b0a33ed1b857112785cd83ca3f8?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">aditianand1709</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Punjab: Predictable result, different readings</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/punjab-shiromani-akali-dal-wins-khadoor-sahib-bypoll/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/punjab-shiromani-akali-dal-wins-khadoor-sahib-bypoll/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2016 02:38:48 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2016 02:55:09 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kanchan Vasdev, Navjeevan Gopal]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[India]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2669754</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Ravinder Singh Brahmpura polled 83,080 votes out of 1.10 lakh, winning by 65,664 votes against Bhupinder Singh Bittu, a rebel expelled by the Congress.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2669754&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2666898 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/khadoor-sahib-lead.jpg\" alt=\"Shiromani Akali Dal, SAdKhadoor Sahib, Khadoor Sahib by-elections, Khadoor sahib bypolls, Punjab elections, punjab polls, Congress, Amrinder Singh, BJP in Punjab, Akali Dal, Punjab news, Punjab latest news, Guru Granth Sahib, Sacrilege \" /> Voters wait in a queue to cast their votes outside a polling station, in Khadoor Sahib on Saturday, February 13 2016.

Brahmpura\u2019s vote share was 80 per cent, with all others losing their deposit.</p>\n<p>The Congress dismissed the victory and said the real test would be in the 2017 assembly polls while Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said the result had laid the foundation for a SAD-<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/\">BJP</a> victory next year.</p>\n<p>The previous Congress MLA, Ramanjit Singh Sikki, had quit last October citing incidents of desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib across Punjab.

The party could barely manage a \u201cpartial boycott\u201d, plus it lost an opportunity to test the waters ahead of 2017. \u201cWe could have been a barometer of how people\u2019s anger against Akalis manifested itself,\u201d said another senior Congress leader.</p>\n<p>If there is any disquiet over the low turnout, Akali Dal leaders are not showing it. \u201cWe kept saying the proof of the pudding would be apparent. And here it is, for everybody to see. The Congress needs a rethink on what people think about them,\u201d said Parambans Singh Romana, an Akali leader.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2669754&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/punjab-shiromani-akali-dal-wins-khadoor-sahib-bypoll/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/khadoor-sahib-feature.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/khadoor-sahib-feature.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Khadoor Sahib feature</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad19eff6049dd5571c755a3dacf699fc?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">namithans</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/khadoor-sahib-lead.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Shiromani Akali Dal, SAdKhadoor Sahib, Khadoor Sahib by-elections, Khadoor sahib bypolls, Punjab elections, punjab polls, Congress, Amrinder Singh, BJP in Punjab, Akali Dal, Punjab news, Punjab latest news, Guru Granth Sahib, Sacrilege </media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>",
