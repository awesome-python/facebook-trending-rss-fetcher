Shondaland drama as well as shows from the minds behind Dawson&#8217;s Creek, Jessica Jones, and Star Wars Rebels.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>In many ways, ABC&#39;s 2016-2017 schedule represents a major change for the network. In February, Paul Lee was ousted as president of ABC Entertainment and Channing Dungey &mdash; formerly the head of drama development at the network &mdash; took over the job, hand-selecting which shows would make it to air. </p>\n\n<p>But in other ways, the schedule is also in keeping with what has worked for ABC as of late (almost anything Shonda Rhimes, high concept soaps), which is largely because Dungey helped develop all of those dramas. </p>\n\n<p>The most logical addition to ABC&#39;s slate is another show executive produced by Shonda Rhimes. <i>Still Star-Crossed</i>, which takes place in Verona after Romeo and Juliet&#39;s deaths, will join <i>Grey&#39;s Anatomy</i>, <i>Scandal</i>, <i>How to Get Away With Murder</i>, and <i>The Catch</i> in the increasingly crowded Shondaland block dubbed T.G.I.T. (T.G.I.M., perhaps? T.G.I.F. has worked on ABC before...). </p>\n\n<p>Three new dramas boast big names in front of and behind the camera: <i>24</i> alum Kiefer Sutherland is now playing the president on <i>Designator Survivor</i>, Agent Carter herself (<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/2016-tv-season-renewals-cancellations-bubble?utm_term=.gnBW3ProN#.sfL19mxwn\">RIP</a>) Hayley Atwell headlines the legal procedural <i>Conviction</i>, and Kevin Williamson (creator of <i>Dawson&#39;s Creek</i>, <i>The Following</i>, and <i>Scream</i>) sticks to his strengths with the thriller <i>Time After Time</i>, a cat and mouse game about Jack the Ripper. </p>\n\n<p>As far as familiar ABC programming, many fans were shocked by the cancelation of <i>Nashville</i> (although, if we&#39;re being honest, it was long past time to free Connie Britton) and Dungey&#39;s drama roots may explain why the acclaimed but low-rated <i>American Crime</i> is coming back for Season 3. Still, other decisions were out of her hands: <i>Quantico</i> was renewed before she took over and the now-canceled <i>Castle</i> all but imploded with the exit of star Stana Katic.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a closer look at the new shows coming to ABC in the 2016-2017 season.</p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1><i>Conviction</i></h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/18/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-5254-1463092689-1.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"497\" alt=\"Conviction\" /></p>\n \n\t<p><b>Who&rsquo;s in it?</b> Hayley Atwell, Eddie Cahill, Shawn Ashmore, Merrin Dungey, Emily Kinney, Manny Montana, Daniel DiTomasso <br />\n<b>Who created it?</b> Liz Friedman, Liz Friedlander, Mark Gordon<br />\n<b>What&rsquo;s it about?</b> Former first daughter Hayes Morrison (Atwell) is trying to avoid jail time for cocaine possession and totally fucking up her mom&#39;s Senate campaign, so she accepts a job from her nemesis NY District Attorney Wayne Wallis (Cahill).

In February, Paul Lee was ousted as president of ABC Entertainment and Channing Dungey &#x2014; formerly the head of drama development at the network &#x2014;&#x26;nbsp;took over the job, hand-selecting which shows would make it to air. \n\nBut in other ways, the schedule is also in keeping with what has worked for ABC as of late (almost anything Shonda Rhimes, high concept soaps), which is largely because Dungey helped develop all of those dramas. \n\nThe most logical addition to ABC&#x27;s slate is another show executive produced by Shonda Rhimes. &#x3C;i&#x3E;Still Star-Crossed&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, which takes place in Verona after Romeo and Juliet&#x27;s deaths, will join &#x3C;i&#x3E;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Scandal&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, &#x3C;i&#x3E;How to Get Away With Murder&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, and &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Catch&#x3C;/i&#x3E; in the increasingly crowded Shondaland block dubbed T.G.I.T. (T.G.I.M., perhaps? T.G.I.F. has worked on ABC before...). \n\nThree new dramas boast big names in front of and behind the camera: &#x3C;i&#x3E;24&#x3C;/i&#x3E; alum Kiefer Sutherland is now playing the president on &#x3C;i&#x3E;Designator Survivor&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, Agent Carter herself (&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/2016-tv-season-renewals-cancellations-bubble?utm_term=.gnBW3ProN#.sfL19mxwn&#x22;&#x3E;RIP&#x3C;/a&#x3E;) Hayley Atwell headlines the legal procedural &#x3C;i&#x3E;Conviction&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, and Kevin Williamson (creator of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Following&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Scream&#x3C;/i&#x3E;) sticks to his strengths with the thriller &#x3C;i&#x3E;Time After Time&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, a cat and mouse game about Jack the Ripper. \n\nAs far as familiar ABC programming, many fans were shocked by the cancelation of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Nashville&#x3C;/i&#x3E; (although, if we&#x27;re being honest, it was long past time to free Connie Britton) and Dungey&#x27;s drama roots may explain why the acclaimed but low-rated &#x3C;i&#x3E;American Crime&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is coming back for Season 3. Still, other decisions were out of her hands: &#x3C;i&#x3E;Quantico&#x3C;/i&#x3E; was renewed before she took over and the now-canceled &#x3C;i&#x3E;Castle&#x3C;/i&#x3E; all but imploded with the exit of star Stana Katic.\n\nHere&#x27;s a closer look at the new shows coming to ABC in the 2016-2017 season.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"497\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/18/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-5254-1463092689-1.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x3C;b&#x3E;Who&#x2019;s in it?&#x3C;/b&#x3E; Hayley Atwell, Eddie Cahill, Shawn Ashmore, Merrin Dungey, Emily Kinney, Manny Montana, Daniel DiTomasso \n&#x3C;b&#x3E;Who created it?&#x3C;/b&#x3E; Liz Friedman, Liz Friedlander, Mark Gordon\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;What&#x2019;s it about?&#x3C;/b&#x3E; Former first daughter Hayes Morrison (Atwell) is trying to avoid jail time for cocaine possession and totally fucking up her mom&#x27;s Senate campaign, so she accepts a job from her nemesis NY District Attorney Wayne Wallis (Cahill). Working for Wallis&#x27;s new Conviction Integrity Unit, she&#x27;s tasked with turning over cases where there might&#x27;ve been a wrongful conviction.

Good luck to that one.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the new shows coming to The CW in the 2016-2017 season.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"326\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/12/17/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-24138-1463090036-13.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x3C;b&#x3E;Who&#x27;s in it?&#x3C;/b&#x3E; Riley Smith, Mekhi Phifer, Peyton List, Lenny Jacobson, Anthony Ruivivar, Devin Kelley, Daniel Bonjour \n&#x3C;b&#x3E;Who created it?&#x3C;/b&#x3E; Jeremy Carver, Toby Emmerich, John Rickard, Dan Lin, Jennifer Gwartz\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;What&#x27;s it about?&#x3C;/b&#x3E; The 2000 movie starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel is getting a modern-day reboot, only with a female star.

But it wasn&rsquo;t long before Huang began making headlines himself. Frustrated with ABC&rsquo;s depiction of his childhood, the real-life Huang wrote a <i>New York Magazine</i> essay <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2015/01/eddie-huang-fresh-off-the-boat-abc.html\">denouncing <i>Fresh Off the Boat</i></a> as a &ldquo;reverse-yellowface show with universal white stories played out by Chinamen&rdquo; and a &ldquo;cornstarch sitcom.&rdquo; A few months later, he <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/susancheng/eddie-huang-says-he-doesnt-watch-fresh-off-the-boat?utm_term=.pyBYv7n42#.hoKXewmLY\">slammed the network on Twitter, saying</a> the show bore no resemblance to his life.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/13/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web01/longform-7619-1463073842-6.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Hudson Yang as young Eddie Huang on Season 1 of ABC&#39;s <i>Fresh Off the Boat</i>.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Gilles Mingasson / Getty Images</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, he stopped watching altogether.</p><p>Now, more than a year later, he says he&rsquo;s moved on entirely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think people realize how weird it is to watch a 12-year-old kid act out your childhood,&rdquo; Huang told BuzzFeed News with a small smile, sitting inside the Vice Media offices in Venice, California, in late April. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like basking in yourself. That&rsquo;s a lot of ego, to sit back on the couch and look at someone act out your life. Even if it were exactly like the book, it would have been unhealthy. And that&rsquo;s something I didn&rsquo;t realize when we did the show.&rdquo;</p><p>But since then, he has cut ties with <i>Fresh Off the Boat</i>.

Not only is his show four times the length of his original web series, but his team grew too. &ldquo;There are more people whose lives depend on this,&rdquo; he said. The stress seems to have taken a toll on Huang, who appeared a little weary and distracted during his interview with BuzzFeed News.</p><p>But Huang was determined not to let the move to television &mdash; or the pressure that comes with it &mdash; change his show. Some of the &ldquo;veteran TV guys that were hired to come in and work on the show,&rdquo; as Huang described them, pushed for voiceover and reality television setups, which he fought hard against.</p><p>&ldquo;Compared to any other travel show you see, we have the least amount of voiceover ...

We try to meet people who don&rsquo;t have an agenda, [whose] ideas and identities are looked over and ignored a lot of times,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>In an upcoming episode of <i>Huang&rsquo;s World</i>, for instance, he and his crew travel to Istanbul, where he breaks fast with a Muslim family during Ramadan. It was his intention to show a different side of a region in the world that often only gets media attention in relation to ISIS. &ldquo;The few radical maniacs killing people are being allowed to define everybody else that&rsquo;s part of this religion, and it&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; Huang said, his vexation oozing out of every word. &ldquo;If I was Middle Eastern, I would hate to be defined by these psychos who I have nothing to do with.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>It&rsquo;s easy to</b> see why Huang is so keenly sensitive to the way minorities are portrayed in the media. As an Asian-American man, he&rsquo;s had to go through a lifetime of society telling him who he can be. <i>&ldquo;Asians, you guys are nerds. Asian men, you&rsquo;re emasculated</i>,<i>&rdquo;</i> he said mockingly. &ldquo;I just always felt like, this kind of sucks to be siloed off in the world and segregated because of my skin. Like, wait, you&rsquo;re trying to tell me because I look this way that I&rsquo;m supposed to be good at counting and can&rsquo;t do anything else?&rdquo;</p><p>His frustration with the portrayal of Asians in film and television is also a reason he penned that <i>New York</i> <i>Magazine</i> essay in early 2015, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2015/01/eddie-huang-fresh-off-the-boat-abc.html\">ripping <i>Fresh Off the Boat</i>&rsquo;s depiction of his family</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/14/enhanced/webdr13/longform-31108-1463077413-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"449\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Photographed at Baohaus on April 27 in New York.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Randall [Park] was neutered, Constance [Wu] was exoticized, and Young Eddie was urbanized so that the viewers got their mise-en-place. People watching these channels have never seen us, and the network&rsquo;s approach to pacifying them is to say we&rsquo;re all the same. Sell them pasteurized network television with East Asian faces until they wake up intolerant of their own lactose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think it was very important I stood up,&rdquo; he told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;I started a conversation about how we&rsquo;re portrayed and how a person loses control of his identity, what the system does, and how the system skews and projects a hologram of us at times in the media.&rdquo;</p><p>Instead, he wants to speak for himself and explain who he is on his own terms, which seems all the more challenging when there&rsquo;s an entire television show based off his family&rsquo;s story: Born in Washington, D.C., to immigrant parents, Huang then moved to a lily-white suburban neighborhood in Orlando, Florida, where his father, Louis, opened up a steakhouse. But <i>Fresh Off the Boat</i>, the show, really only scratches the surface of what the Huangs have been through.</p><p>&ldquo;My grandma had bound feet, my grandpa committed suicide, [Florida&rsquo;s Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services] tried to take us from my parents. That shit was real,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrEddieHuang/status/585667108933099520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">he tweeted in April 2015</a>, while also addressing his affinity for hip-hop. &ldquo;My relationship to hip hop and black culture rose from being the victim of domestic violence. It&#39;s not a game. That music meant something to me.&rdquo;</p><p>In his memoir, Huang ruminates at length on identity and how white Americans tried to skew his self-perception:</p>\n\n<p>All my life people would call me a chink or a chigger. I couldn&rsquo;t listen to hip-hop and be myself without people questioning my authenticity. Chinese people questioned my yellowness because I was born in America. Then white people questioned my identity as an American because I was yellow ...</p><p>We can&rsquo;t fucking win. If I follow the rules and play the model minority, I&rsquo;m a lapdog under a bamboo ceiling. If I like hip-hop because I see solidarity, then I&rsquo;m aping. But if I throw it all away, shit on my parents, sell weed, pills, and strike fear into unsuspecting white boys with stunt Glocks, now I&rsquo;m authentic? Fuck you, America.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-6095-1463077097-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"1079\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>This dilemma of</b> never fitting in anywhere and constantly being subjected to stereotyping is an Asian-American frustration that viewers don&rsquo;t see in the 22-minute sitcom.<br /></p><p>When asked what his parents thought about his memoir, Huang responded sharply: &ldquo;My dad&rsquo;s first reaction with the first book was &#39;I&rsquo;m sorry I brought you to this country.&#39; &rsquo;Cause he didn&rsquo;t know how it was for Asian-Americans growing up here.&rdquo; But Huang has still carved out a place for himself in a country that has long ostracized and marginalized Asian-Americans. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy with my life. I was raised in America, and I was born in America, and I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like without it, but &hellip; we did good,&rdquo; he said, softening his tone. &ldquo;We came here, we created our place. And look at us,&rdquo; he added before listing his accomplishments over just the past three years: his memoir; his second book, <i>Double Cup Love</i>, which hits shelves at the end of this month; and, of course, <i>Huang&rsquo;s World</i>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\"I think I&rsquo;m part of something bigger than myself. It&rsquo;s called <i>Huang&rsquo;s World</i>, but it&rsquo;s a movement.\" </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;These are things I&rsquo;m really proud of. They&rsquo;re direct from me to you. And if anyone wants to know what it&rsquo;s like to be this Asian-American person, you will see it,&rdquo; he said, resolutely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given myself up to this show. You see me in bad spots, funny spots, awkward spots: You see my fat ass diving in the water in Jamaica. It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m comfortable with it. I&rsquo;m good. &rsquo;Cause I think I&rsquo;m part of something bigger than myself. It&rsquo;s called <i>Huang&rsquo;s World</i>, but it&rsquo;s a movement.&rdquo;</p><p>Toward what exactly?</p><p>Huang seemed to really ponder what he hoped to impart on his viewers before finally explaining, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have one singular message. I really do like to let the people in these countries speak for themselves ... If there&rsquo;s one thing people could learn from the show and myself, it&rsquo;s empathy: to put yourself in other people&rsquo;s shoes, see it from a different perspective than yours. I think it really makes your view of the world a lot more textured and deep and rich. It&rsquo;s in your own interest to be empathetic. It would suck to be all tunnel-visioned and single-minded and run into a wall like Donald Trump.&rdquo;</p><p>Though Huang didn&rsquo;t hide his contempt for Trump, he seemed perhaps even more frustrated by those who oppose the likely Republican nominee&rsquo;s views but shy away from voicing their unease. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like ISIS, if you don&rsquo;t like Donald Trump, if you don&rsquo;t like radicals, <i>say something</i>,&rdquo; Huang said pressingly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/13/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web01/longform-7730-1463074063-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>The \"Orlando\" episode of <i>Huang&#39;s World</i>.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Courtesy Viceland</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;You have to say something. You have to take it head on, otherwise it goes unchecked. I think it&rsquo;s very important that America&rsquo;s facing itself and seeing almost half our population [share Trump&rsquo;s] views. &hellip; Now you want to stop it, now, because he might be president? You should&rsquo;ve fuckin&rsquo; said something earlier,&rdquo; he said, anger seeping into his voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I feel. That&rsquo;s why I said something at Sausage Castle. That&rsquo;s why I said something in Sicily.<i>&rsquo;</i>&rdquo;</p><p>The latter is a reference to when Huang challenged a group of white supremacists, members of the Italian far-right political party known as Forza Nuova, during his visit to Sicily on a recent episode of <i>Huang&rsquo;s World</i>. And the former is an uncomfortable moment in his hometown of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBsfEz0ZXno\">Orlando</a>, at Sausage Castle, in the last minutes of the Orlando episode, when the proprietor of Sausage Castle, Mike Busey, orders a bikini-clad Chinese woman to speak to the camera in Mandarin: &ldquo;Just make some shit up, and make it sound Asian,&rdquo; prompting a visibly angry Huang to leave, but not before lecturing Busey on why it&rsquo;s wrong to exploit people.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\"I have my beliefs about what&rsquo;s right or wrong. And I&rsquo;m going to stand up for those.\"  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re on my show, you&rsquo;re not going to talk to people that way. I have my standards, and if you don&rsquo;t agree with my standards, you can argue with me,&rdquo; Huang said, revealing that there have been multiple instances where he stepped in and debated with his interviewees. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me trying to pick a fight. I have my beliefs about what&rsquo;s right or wrong. I know how I think people should be treated. And I&rsquo;m going to stand up for those. And if I&rsquo;m wrong, I hope people would stand up to me.&rdquo;</p><p>For minorities in America, speaking out about issues pertaining to identity can lead to being branded as the indignant spokesperson on Twitter, which undermines the point they&#39;re trying to get across. So how does Huang, who sparked controversy after lashing out against ABC last year, stay true to himself without coming off as just another angry Asian person?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned the way to win is to not make it personal,&rdquo; he said immediately. &ldquo;I made a lot of mistakes. I&rsquo;d get angry with something somebody said, but then the way that I addressed them was in a personal manner. And I realize now, don&rsquo;t make it personal. Make it about what they say or what they do.&rdquo;</p><p>Huang acknowledged that&rsquo;s where he went wrong with his criticism of <i>Fresh Off the Boat</i>. &ldquo;I think my job was done when I started the discussion. The <i>New York</i> <i>Magazine</i> article should have been the end of it, and I kept talking. And I think, when I made it personal, that&rsquo;s where I lost,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my only regret. &hellip; But you know what? I live with it. I grew up. I don&rsquo;t think people can blame me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-1570-1463069181-3.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1068\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Susan Cheng</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/susancheng/eddie-huang-is-starting-a-movement</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:56:40 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">It&#x2019;s been over a year since Huang publicly denounced &#x3C;i&#x3E;Fresh Off the Boat&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, the show based loosely on his best-selling memoir.

But it wasn&#x26;rsquo;t long before Huang began making headlines himself. Frustrated with ABC&#x26;rsquo;s depiction of his childhood, the real-life Huang wrote a &#x3C;i&#x3E;New York Magazine&#x3C;/i&#x3E; essay &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.vulture.com/2015/01/eddie-huang-fresh-off-the-boat-abc.html&#x22;&#x3E;denouncing &#x3C;i&#x3E;Fresh Off the Boat&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as a &#x26;ldquo;reverse-yellowface show with universal white stories played out by Chinamen&#x26;rdquo; and a &#x26;ldquo;cornstarch sitcom.&#x26;rdquo; A few months later, he &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/susancheng/eddie-huang-says-he-doesnt-watch-fresh-off-the-boat?utm_term=.pyBYv7n42#.hoKXewmLY&#x22;&#x3E;slammed the network on Twitter, saying&#x3C;/a&#x3E; the show bore no resemblance to his life.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/13/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web01/longform-7619-1463073842-6.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;300&#x22; height=&#x22;200&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hudson Yang as young Eddie Huang on Season 1 of ABC&#x26;#39;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Fresh Off the Boat&#x3C;/i&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Gilles Mingasson / Getty Images&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Eventually, he stopped watching altogether.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Now, more than a year later, he says he&#x26;rsquo;s moved on entirely. &#x26;ldquo;I don&#x26;rsquo;t think people realize how weird it is to watch a 12-year-old kid act out your childhood,&#x26;rdquo; Huang told BuzzFeed News with a small smile, sitting inside the Vice Media offices in Venice, California, in late April. &#x26;ldquo;That&#x26;rsquo;s just like basking in yourself. That&#x26;rsquo;s a lot of ego, to sit back on the couch and look at someone act out your life. Even if it were exactly like the book, it would have been unhealthy. And that&#x26;rsquo;s something I didn&#x26;rsquo;t realize when we did the show.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But since then, he has cut ties with &#x3C;i&#x3E;Fresh Off the Boat&#x3C;/i&#x3E;.

Asian men, you&#x26;rsquo;re emasculated&#x3C;/i&#x3E;,&#x3C;i&#x3E;&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/i&#x3E; he said mockingly. &#x26;ldquo;I just always felt like, this kind of sucks to be siloed off in the world and segregated because of my skin. Like, wait, you&#x26;rsquo;re trying to tell me because I look this way that I&#x26;rsquo;m supposed to be good at counting and can&#x26;rsquo;t do anything else?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;His frustration with the portrayal of Asians in film and television is also a reason he penned that &#x3C;i&#x3E;New York&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x3C;i&#x3E;Magazine&#x3C;/i&#x3E; essay in early 2015, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.vulture.com/2015/01/eddie-huang-fresh-off-the-boat-abc.html&#x22;&#x3E;ripping &#x3C;i&#x3E;Fresh Off the Boat&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x26;rsquo;s depiction of his family&#x3C;/a&#x3E;:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/14/enhanced/webdr13/longform-31108-1463077413-1.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;300&#x22; height=&#x22;449&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Photographed at Baohaus on April 27 in New York.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Randall [Park] was neutered, Constance [Wu] was exoticized, and Young Eddie was urbanized so that the viewers got their mise-en-place. People watching these channels have never seen us, and the network&#x26;rsquo;s approach to pacifying them is to say we&#x26;rsquo;re all the same. Sell them pasteurized network television with East Asian faces until they wake up intolerant of their own lactose.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I think it was very important I stood up,&#x26;rdquo; he told BuzzFeed News. &#x26;ldquo;I started a conversation about how we&#x26;rsquo;re portrayed and how a person loses control of his identity, what the system does, and how the system skews and projects a hologram of us at times in the media.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Instead, he wants to speak for himself and explain who he is on his own terms, which seems all the more challenging when there&#x26;rsquo;s an entire television show based off his family&#x26;rsquo;s story: Born in Washington, D.C., to immigrant parents, Huang then moved to a lily-white suburban neighborhood in Orlando, Florida, where his father, Louis, opened up a steakhouse. But &#x3C;i&#x3E;Fresh Off the Boat&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, the show, really only scratches the surface of what the Huangs have been through.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;My grandma had bound feet, my grandpa committed suicide, [Florida&#x26;rsquo;s Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services] tried to take us from my parents. That shit was real,&#x26;rdquo; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/MrEddieHuang/status/585667108933099520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#x22;&#x3E;he tweeted in April 2015&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, while also addressing his affinity for hip-hop. &#x26;ldquo;My relationship to hip hop and black culture rose from being the victim of domestic violence. It&#x26;#39;s not a game. That music meant something to me.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In his memoir, Huang ruminates at length on identity and how white Americans tried to skew his self-perception:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;All my life people would call me a chink or a chigger. I couldn&#x26;rsquo;t listen to hip-hop and be myself without people questioning my authenticity. Chinese people questioned my yellowness because I was born in America. Then white people questioned my identity as an American because I was yellow ...&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;We can&#x26;rsquo;t fucking win. If I follow the rules and play the model minority, I&#x26;rsquo;m a lapdog under a bamboo ceiling. If I like hip-hop because I see solidarity, then I&#x26;rsquo;m aping. But if I throw it all away, shit on my parents, sell weed, pills, and strike fear into unsuspecting white boys with stunt Glocks, now I&#x26;rsquo;m authentic? Fuck you, America.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-6095-1463077097-1.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;1079&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;This dilemma of&#x3C;/b&#x3E; never fitting in anywhere and constantly being subjected to stereotyping is an Asian-American frustration that viewers don&#x26;rsquo;t see in the 22-minute sitcom.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;When asked what his parents thought about his memoir, Huang responded sharply: &#x26;ldquo;My dad&#x26;rsquo;s first reaction with the first book was &#x26;#39;I&#x26;rsquo;m sorry I brought you to this country.&#x26;#39; &#x26;rsquo;Cause he didn&#x26;rsquo;t know how it was for Asian-Americans growing up here.&#x26;rdquo; But Huang has still carved out a place for himself in a country that has long ostracized and marginalized Asian-Americans. &#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;m happy with my life. I was raised in America, and I was born in America, and I don&#x26;rsquo;t know what it&#x26;rsquo;s like without it, but &#x26;hellip; we did good,&#x26;rdquo; he said, softening his tone. &#x26;ldquo;We came here, we created our place. And look at us,&#x26;rdquo; he added before listing his accomplishments over just the past three years: his memoir; his second book, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Double Cup Love&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, which hits shelves at the end of this month; and, of course, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Huang&#x26;rsquo;s World&#x3C;/i&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;I think I&#x26;rsquo;m part of something bigger than myself. It&#x26;rsquo;s called &#x3C;i&#x3E;Huang&#x26;rsquo;s World&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, but it&#x26;rsquo;s a movement.&#x22; &#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;These are things I&#x26;rsquo;m really proud of. They&#x26;rsquo;re direct from me to you. And if anyone wants to know what it&#x26;rsquo;s like to be this Asian-American person, you will see it,&#x26;rdquo; he said, resolutely. &#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;ve given myself up to this show. You see me in bad spots, funny spots, awkward spots: You see my fat ass diving in the water in Jamaica. It&#x26;rsquo;s fine. I&#x26;rsquo;m comfortable with it. I&#x26;rsquo;m good. &#x26;rsquo;Cause I think I&#x26;rsquo;m part of something bigger than myself. It&#x26;rsquo;s called &#x3C;i&#x3E;Huang&#x26;rsquo;s World&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, but it&#x26;rsquo;s a movement.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Toward what exactly?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Huang seemed to really ponder what he hoped to impart on his viewers before finally explaining, &#x26;ldquo;I don&#x26;rsquo;t think I have one singular message. I really do like to let the people in these countries speak for themselves ... If there&#x26;rsquo;s one thing people could learn from the show and myself, it&#x26;rsquo;s empathy: to put yourself in other people&#x26;rsquo;s shoes, see it from a different perspective than yours. I think it really makes your view of the world a lot more textured and deep and rich. It&#x26;rsquo;s in your own interest to be empathetic. It would suck to be all tunnel-visioned and single-minded and run into a wall like Donald Trump.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Though Huang didn&#x26;rsquo;t hide his contempt for Trump, he seemed perhaps even more frustrated by those who oppose the likely Republican nominee&#x26;rsquo;s views but shy away from voicing their unease. &#x26;ldquo;If you don&#x26;rsquo;t like ISIS, if you don&#x26;rsquo;t like Donald Trump, if you don&#x26;rsquo;t like radicals, &#x3C;i&#x3E;say something&#x3C;/i&#x3E;,&#x26;rdquo; Huang said pressingly.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/13/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web01/longform-7730-1463074063-1.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;300&#x22; height=&#x22;169&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x22;Orlando&#x22; episode of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Huang&#x26;#39;s World&#x3C;/i&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Courtesy Viceland&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;You have to say something. You have to take it head on, otherwise it goes unchecked. I think it&#x26;rsquo;s very important that America&#x26;rsquo;s facing itself and seeing almost half our population [share Trump&#x26;rsquo;s] views. &#x26;hellip; Now you want to stop it, now, because he might be president? You should&#x26;rsquo;ve fuckin&#x26;rsquo; said something earlier,&#x26;rdquo; he said, anger seeping into his voice. &#x26;ldquo;That&#x26;rsquo;s how I feel. That&#x26;rsquo;s why I said something at Sausage Castle. That&#x26;rsquo;s why I said something in Sicily.&#x3C;i&#x3E;&#x26;rsquo;&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The latter is a reference to when Huang challenged a group of white supremacists, members of the Italian far-right political party known as Forza Nuova, during his visit to Sicily on a recent episode of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Huang&#x26;rsquo;s World&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. And the former is an uncomfortable moment in his hometown of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBsfEz0ZXno&#x22;&#x3E;Orlando&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, at Sausage Castle, in the last minutes of the Orlando episode, when the proprietor of Sausage Castle, Mike Busey, orders a bikini-clad Chinese woman to speak to the camera in Mandarin: &#x26;ldquo;Just make some shit up, and make it sound Asian,&#x26;rdquo; prompting a visibly angry Huang to leave, but not before lecturing Busey on why it&#x26;rsquo;s wrong to exploit people.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;I have my beliefs about what&#x26;rsquo;s right or wrong. And I&#x26;rsquo;m going to stand up for those.&#x22;  &#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;When you&#x26;rsquo;re on my show, you&#x26;rsquo;re not going to talk to people that way. I have my standards, and if you don&#x26;rsquo;t agree with my standards, you can argue with me,&#x26;rdquo; Huang said, revealing that there have been multiple instances where he stepped in and debated with his interviewees. &#x26;ldquo;It&#x26;rsquo;s not me trying to pick a fight. I have my beliefs about what&#x26;rsquo;s right or wrong. I know how I think people should be treated. And I&#x26;rsquo;m going to stand up for those. And if I&#x26;rsquo;m wrong, I hope people would stand up to me.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;For minorities in America, speaking out about issues pertaining to identity can lead to being branded as the indignant spokesperson on Twitter, which undermines the point they&#x26;#39;re trying to get across. So how does Huang, who sparked controversy after lashing out against ABC last year, stay true to himself without coming off as just another angry Asian person?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;ve learned the way to win is to not make it personal,&#x26;rdquo; he said immediately. &#x26;ldquo;I made a lot of mistakes. I&#x26;rsquo;d get angry with something somebody said, but then the way that I addressed them was in a personal manner. And I realize now, don&#x26;rsquo;t make it personal. Make it about what they say or what they do.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Huang acknowledged that&#x26;rsquo;s where he went wrong with his criticism of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Fresh Off the Boat&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. &#x26;ldquo;I think my job was done when I started the discussion. The &#x3C;i&#x3E;New York&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x3C;i&#x3E;Magazine&#x3C;/i&#x3E; article should have been the end of it, and I kept talking. And I think, when I made it personal, that&#x26;rsquo;s where I lost,&#x26;rdquo; he said earnestly. &#x26;ldquo;That&#x26;rsquo;s my only regret. &#x26;hellip; But you know what? I live with it. I grew up. I don&#x26;rsquo;t think people can blame me.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-1570-1463069181-3.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;1600&#x22; height=&#x22;1068&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;I refuse to bash that show anymore.&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;You&#x2019;re trying to tell me because I look this way that I&#x2019;m supposed to be good at counting and can&#x2019;t do anything else?&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;I think I&#x2019;m part of something bigger than myself.

Cut to Africa, where a local preacher stands on his pulpit. The instant the word &ldquo;God&rdquo; passes the preacher&rsquo;s lips, the intergalactic object crashes into him. First, it infuses the mystery man with an immediately perceptible influx of power. &ldquo;I am the prophet,&rdquo; he bellows. &ldquo;I am the chosen one.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s when he explodes, drenching his congregation in a horrifying but comical typhoon of blood and entrails.</p><p>That opening scene &mdash; a defacto &ldquo;Welcome to the insanity of <i>Preacher</i>&#33;&rdquo; &mdash; kicks off AMC&rsquo;s inspired adaptation of Garth Ennis&rsquo;s revered comic book series; it&rsquo;s part gritty Western, part religious examination, part vampire thriller, part slapstick comedy, part action-adventure, part family drama, and &mdash; by design &mdash; entirely risky.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fucking crazy, and it should not be on television,&rdquo; <i>Preacher</i> co-executive producer Sam Catlin told BuzzFeed News, with a laugh, backstage at WonderCon in March. &ldquo;But also could only be on television now.&rdquo; Catlin, who spent four seasons executive producing and writing on <i>Breaking Bad</i>, said thanks are due to boundary-obliterating genre shows like <i>Game of Thrones</i> and <i>The Walking Dead</i> so that unconventional <i>Preacher</i> is even able to exist as a series today.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/12/enhanced/webdr14/longform-18006-1463072316-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"461\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Vertigo</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Created in 1995 by Ennis and artist Steve Dillon, <i>Preacher</i> is centered on Rev. Jesse Custer, a small town Texan who has lost his way, his faith, and the trust of his congregation, when Genesis &mdash; the same supernatural entity that obliterated that African cleric &mdash; possesses him. After successfully bonding with the spirit, Custer begins to slowly develop otherworldly powers and discovers he&rsquo;s not the only supernatural being on this planet.</p><p>The comics, which spanned more than 70 issues, were one of the first of many pop culture obsessions Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg &mdash; who developed the series with Catlin and co-directed the pilot &mdash; bonded over as kids. As adults, the duo spent longer than a decade trying to get the rights to <i>Preacher</i> to no avail. &ldquo;More successful people than us were always able to get their hands on it,&rdquo; Rogen told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview. Among those were Kevin Smith and Sam Mendes, who each previously attempted to adapt the source material, but the genre-bending series proved to be too tricky, and their projects never made it off the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone before us tried to do a darker version, and without the lightness and the comedy that is in the comic, it doesn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Goldberg told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview.</p><p>&ldquo;I think the sense of fun is something that seemed to be elusive in other incarnations of this,&rdquo; Rogen added. &ldquo;It&#39;s not a combination you see very often by any means, and for us, that was the thing we talked the most about as we put the show together and prepared to direct it: How do we combine this dramatic character Western story with all these crazy elements that converge on it?&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to comedy, drama, and Western, the show includes touches of noir, sci-fi, action, horror, and some of the blackest humor to ever grace television screens. Take for example, a scene where the empowered Custer kindly advises Ted (Brian Huskey) &mdash; a parishioner with mommy issues &mdash; to &ldquo;open your heart.&rdquo; Taking the advice way too literally, Ted confronts his mother and cuts his heart from his chest before, in his dying act, handing the bloody gift to his mother.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/13/enhanced/webdr15/enhanced-mid-567-1463072709-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Matthias Clamer / AMC</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>To pull off the giant stylistic mashup, Catlin drew inspiration from Ennis&rsquo;s self-assured source material. &ldquo;Garth just does it,&rdquo; he said with a simple shrug of his shoulders. &ldquo;There&#39;s something unapologetic about it. It&#39;s a recognizable world that looks like America, but there&#39;s vampires and crazy cults and angels, and the confidence with which these elements are introduced has been the example we&#39;ve been trying to follow.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dominic Cooper, who plays Custer, called the pilot &ldquo;one of the best things I&#39;ve read in years,&rdquo; but he initially had reservations over the intimidating number of genres the script required him to play. &ldquo;I was petrified about the prospect once I actually realized I was going to do it,&rdquo; he told BuzzFeed News at WonderCon. &ldquo;Every day is quite complex and quite a challenge because of all that. It can be daunting and you can feel a bit lost at times, but the writing is so strong and so clear and Sam&#39;s overview is so secure, it&#39;s a joy. But you do question a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>Cooper was also slightly worried by the idea of breathing life into a character that millions of comic book readers had visualized in their heads for years. &ldquo;I felt such a responsibility to the people who have grown up with the comic,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;The actor needs to encompass everything the show encompasses, which is something that&#39;s very dark at times but also light at times, something that is very funny at times and romantic and sexual at times,&rdquo; Rogen said. &ldquo;We needed an actor who could star in all those different shows, basically.&rdquo;</p><p>For the show&rsquo;s trio of creators, Cooper was always someone at the top of their ever-changing list, thanks to the varied roles he&rsquo;s played throughout his career. They cited Cooper&rsquo;s humorous work as Howard Stark in the Captain America films, his malevolent performance as Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s twisted son in <i>Devil&rsquo;s Double</i>, and the posh swagger he brought to Bond author Ian Fleming in <i>Fleming</i>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/13/enhanced/webdr15/longform-565-1463072769-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"258\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Matthias Clamer / AMC</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Producers cast a much wider net when it came to hiring an actor to play Tulip O&rsquo;Hare, Jesse&rsquo;s deadly ex, who is first introduced on the show when she&rsquo;s in the middle of a brutal close-quarters fistfight with two men in a moving car. After what &ldquo;felt like 72 auditions,&rdquo; Ruth Negga &mdash; best known for playing Raina on <i>Marvel&rsquo;s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> &mdash; landed the role she never imagined she would ever get.</p><p>&ldquo;When I read the pilot, I rang my agent and said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re sending me something I&rsquo;m never going to get and that&rsquo;s mean,&rsquo;&rdquo; she told BuzzFeed News. However, once she stepped into tryouts, Rogen and Goldberg quickly became fans of Negga&rsquo;s take on Tulip. &ldquo;Seth and Evan were like soccer moms cheering me on.\"</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wild, unpredictable nature to her as a person that works for the character,&rdquo; Rogen said. &ldquo;There&#39;s a very easy way for it to just become this femme fatale with a gun, but she really added a lot of humor and sympathy and at the same time, created a character that was immensely watchable and someone you were really interested in learning more about.&rdquo;</p><p>On paper, Negga &mdash; who stands 5&rsquo; 3&rdquo; &mdash; might not seem like the most obvious choice to play an unabashed brute, but she feels that being physically underestimated works to the character&rsquo;s advantage. &ldquo;It&#39;s not because she&#39;s got big muscles, it&#39;s because she commits to the idea that you can&#39;t fuck with her. And her temper is her strength,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think a lot of women can identify with that, but I&#39;ve never seen it reflected on camera at all actually. Her volatility is something we&#39;ve only really seen in men characters before.&rdquo;</p><p>Tulip&rsquo;s belief in herself speaks to the show&rsquo;s most significant theme: faith. The faith one has in God, the faith one has in society, the faith one can exploit, and how the faithful are tested day to day. Building an entire series around religious identification (or the lack thereof) might seem risky, as the desire for every show to appeal to as broad an audience as possible has resulted lately in increasingly agnostic television fare. But everyone involved insists that <i>Preacher</i> isn&rsquo;t, ironically, preaching to the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/13/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-mid-4719-1463072844-1.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"452\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Matthias Clamer / AMC</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think religion as a topic, everyone has an opinion about it &mdash; religion is in decline or religion is under threat or religion is the cause of every problem in the world,&rdquo; said Catlin. &ldquo;What I like about the world in <i>Preacher</i> is we have hardcore atheists and very religious people and they&#39;re all sort of butting heads together. But it isn&#39;t about religion, it&#39;s about what we&#39;re all doing here on this mess of a planet.&rdquo;</p><p>Like all good preachers do, the show is committed to presenting complex concepts but leaving it up to the congregation to decipher meaning. &ldquo;It asks loads of questions, and it&#39;s not afraid to ask questions it knows there&#39;s no answer to,&rdquo; Negga said. &ldquo;It&#39;s like a &lsquo;fuck you&rsquo; to tidy politics. That&#39;s what Garth&#39;s comics do, they really force you to think about what you believe and why you believe it &mdash; and if you should believe it, because is it really worth believing in?&rdquo;</p><p>While it remains to be seen if audiences congregate every Sunday for <i>Preacher</i>, should the series follow in the footsteps of <i>The Walking Dead</i> &mdash; AMC&rsquo;s most popular show, also adapted from a comic book &mdash; Cooper feels confident the stage is set for a rich, multi-season journey. &ldquo;Playing Jesse for a long time doesn&#39;t feel daunting because &mdash; and this happens so rarely &mdash; each scene is like this little nugget of excellence that I can&#39;t wait to crack open,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One minute you&#39;ll adore him, and the next you&#39;ll think he&#39;s the most vile human being on Earth, given what he&#39;s capable of.

First, it infuses the mystery man with an immediately perceptible influx of power. &#x26;ldquo;I am the prophet,&#x26;rdquo; he bellows. &#x26;ldquo;I am the chosen one.&#x26;rdquo; And that&#x26;rsquo;s when he explodes, drenching his congregation in a horrifying but comical typhoon of blood and entrails.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;That opening scene &#x26;mdash; a defacto &#x26;ldquo;Welcome to the insanity of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Preacher&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x26;#33;&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;mdash; kicks off AMC&#x26;rsquo;s inspired adaptation of Garth Ennis&#x26;rsquo;s revered comic book series; it&#x26;rsquo;s part gritty Western, part religious examination, part vampire thriller, part slapstick comedy, part action-adventure, part family drama, and &#x26;mdash; by design &#x26;mdash; entirely risky.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;It&#x26;rsquo;s fucking crazy, and it should not be on television,&#x26;rdquo; &#x3C;i&#x3E;Preacher&#x3C;/i&#x3E; co-executive producer Sam Catlin told BuzzFeed News, with a laugh, backstage at WonderCon in March. &#x26;ldquo;But also could only be on television now.&#x26;rdquo; Catlin, who spent four seasons executive producing and writing on &#x3C;i&#x3E;Breaking Bad&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, said thanks are due to boundary-obliterating genre shows like &#x3C;i&#x3E;Game of Thrones&#x3C;/i&#x3E; and &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Walking Dead&#x3C;/i&#x3E; so that unconventional &#x3C;i&#x3E;Preacher&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is even able to exist as a series today.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/12/enhanced/webdr14/longform-18006-1463072316-1.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;300&#x22; height=&#x22;461&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Vertigo&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Created in 1995 by Ennis and artist Steve Dillon, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Preacher&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is centered on Rev. Jesse Custer, a small town Texan who has lost his way, his faith, and the trust of his congregation, when Genesis &#x26;mdash; the same supernatural entity that obliterated that African cleric &#x26;mdash; possesses him. After successfully bonding with the spirit, Custer begins to slowly develop otherworldly powers and discovers he&#x26;rsquo;s not the only supernatural being on this planet.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The comics, which spanned more than 70 issues, were one of the first of many pop culture obsessions Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg &#x26;mdash; who developed the series with Catlin and co-directed the pilot &#x26;mdash; bonded over as kids. As adults, the duo spent longer than a decade trying to get the rights to &#x3C;i&#x3E;Preacher&#x3C;/i&#x3E; to no avail. &#x26;ldquo;More successful people than us were always able to get their hands on it,&#x26;rdquo; Rogen told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview. Among those were Kevin Smith and Sam Mendes, who each previously attempted to adapt the source material, but the genre-bending series proved to be too tricky, and their projects never made it off the ground.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Everyone before us tried to do a darker version, and without the lightness and the comedy that is in the comic, it doesn&#x26;rsquo;t work,&#x26;rdquo; Goldberg told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I think the sense of fun is something that seemed to be elusive in other incarnations of this,&#x26;rdquo; Rogen added. &#x26;ldquo;It&#x26;#39;s not a combination you see very often by any means, and for us, that was the thing we talked the most about as we put the show together and prepared to direct it: How do we combine this dramatic character Western story with all these crazy elements that converge on it?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In addition to comedy, drama, and Western, the show includes touches of noir, sci-fi, action, horror, and some of the blackest humor to ever grace television screens. Take for example, a scene where the empowered Custer kindly advises Ted (Brian Huskey) &#x26;mdash; a parishioner with mommy issues &#x26;mdash; to &#x26;ldquo;open your heart.&#x26;rdquo; Taking the advice way too literally, Ted confronts his mother and cuts his heart from his chest before, in his dying act, handing the bloody gift to his mother.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/13/enhanced/webdr15/enhanced-mid-567-1463072709-1.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;480&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Matthias Clamer / AMC&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;To pull off the giant stylistic mashup, Catlin drew inspiration from Ennis&#x26;rsquo;s self-assured source material. &#x26;ldquo;Garth just does it,&#x26;rdquo; he said with a simple shrug of his shoulders. &#x26;ldquo;There&#x26;#39;s something unapologetic about it. It&#x26;#39;s a recognizable world that looks like America, but there&#x26;#39;s vampires and crazy cults and angels, and the confidence with which these elements are introduced has been the example we&#x26;#39;ve been trying to follow.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Dominic Cooper, who plays Custer, called the pilot &#x26;ldquo;one of the best things I&#x26;#39;ve read in years,&#x26;rdquo; but he initially had reservations over the intimidating number of genres the script required him to play. &#x26;ldquo;I was petrified about the prospect once I actually realized I was going to do it,&#x26;rdquo; he told BuzzFeed News at WonderCon. &#x26;ldquo;Every day is quite complex and quite a challenge because of all that. It can be daunting and you can feel a bit lost at times, but the writing is so strong and so clear and Sam&#x26;#39;s overview is so secure, it&#x26;#39;s a joy. But you do question a lot.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Cooper was also slightly worried by the idea of breathing life into a character that millions of comic book readers had visualized in their heads for years. &#x26;ldquo;I felt such a responsibility to the people who have grown up with the comic,&#x26;rdquo; he said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;The actor needs to encompass everything the show encompasses, which is something that&#x26;#39;s very dark at times but also light at times, something that is very funny at times and romantic and sexual at times,&#x26;rdquo; Rogen said. &#x26;ldquo;We needed an actor who could star in all those different shows, basically.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;For the show&#x26;rsquo;s trio of creators, Cooper was always someone at the top of their ever-changing list, thanks to the varied roles he&#x26;rsquo;s played throughout his career. They cited Cooper&#x26;rsquo;s humorous work as Howard Stark in the Captain America films, his malevolent performance as Saddam Hussein&#x26;rsquo;s twisted son in &#x3C;i&#x3E;Devil&#x26;rsquo;s Double&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, and the posh swagger he brought to Bond author Ian Fleming in &#x3C;i&#x3E;Fleming&#x3C;/i&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/13/enhanced/webdr15/longform-565-1463072769-1.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;300&#x22; height=&#x22;258&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Matthias Clamer / AMC&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Producers cast a much wider net when it came to hiring an actor to play Tulip O&#x26;rsquo;Hare, Jesse&#x26;rsquo;s deadly ex, who is first introduced on the show when she&#x26;rsquo;s in the middle of a brutal close-quarters fistfight with two men in a moving car. After what &#x26;ldquo;felt like 72 auditions,&#x26;rdquo; Ruth Negga &#x26;mdash; best known for playing Raina on &#x3C;i&#x3E;Marvel&#x26;rsquo;s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; landed the role she never imagined she would ever get.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;When I read the pilot, I rang my agent and said, &#x26;lsquo;You&#x26;rsquo;re sending me something I&#x26;rsquo;m never going to get and that&#x26;rsquo;s mean,&#x26;rsquo;&#x26;rdquo; she told BuzzFeed News. However, once she stepped into tryouts, Rogen and Goldberg quickly became fans of Negga&#x26;rsquo;s take on Tulip. &#x26;ldquo;Seth and Evan were like soccer moms cheering me on.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;There&#x26;rsquo;s a wild, unpredictable nature to her as a person that works for the character,&#x26;rdquo; Rogen said. &#x26;ldquo;There&#x26;#39;s a very easy way for it to just become this femme fatale with a gun, but she really added a lot of humor and sympathy and at the same time, created a character that was immensely watchable and someone you were really interested in learning more about.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On paper, Negga &#x26;mdash; who stands 5&#x26;rsquo; 3&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;mdash; might not seem like the most obvious choice to play an unabashed brute, but she feels that being physically underestimated works to the character&#x26;rsquo;s advantage. &#x26;ldquo;It&#x26;#39;s not because she&#x26;#39;s got big muscles, it&#x26;#39;s because she commits to the idea that you can&#x26;#39;t fuck with her. And her temper is her strength,&#x26;rdquo; she said. &#x26;ldquo;I think a lot of women can identify with that, but I&#x26;#39;ve never seen it reflected on camera at all actually. Her volatility is something we&#x26;#39;ve only really seen in men characters before.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Tulip&#x26;rsquo;s belief in herself speaks to the show&#x26;rsquo;s most significant theme: faith. The faith one has in God, the faith one has in society, the faith one can exploit, and how the faithful are tested day to day. Building an entire series around religious identification (or the lack thereof) might seem risky, as the desire for every show to appeal to as broad an audience as possible has resulted lately in increasingly agnostic television fare. But everyone involved insists that &#x3C;i&#x3E;Preacher&#x3C;/i&#x3E; isn&#x26;rsquo;t, ironically, preaching to the audience.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/12/13/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-mid-4719-1463072844-1.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;452&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Matthias Clamer / AMC&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I think religion as a topic, everyone has an opinion about it &#x26;mdash; religion is in decline or religion is under threat or religion is the cause of every problem in the world,&#x26;rdquo; said Catlin. &#x26;ldquo;What I like about the world in &#x3C;i&#x3E;Preacher&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is we have hardcore atheists and very religious people and they&#x26;#39;re all sort of butting heads together. But it isn&#x26;#39;t about religion, it&#x26;#39;s about what we&#x26;#39;re all doing here on this mess of a planet.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Like all good preachers do, the show is committed to presenting complex concepts but leaving it up to the congregation to decipher meaning. &#x26;ldquo;It asks loads of questions, and it&#x26;#39;s not afraid to ask questions it knows there&#x26;#39;s no answer to,&#x26;rdquo; Negga said. &#x26;ldquo;It&#x26;#39;s like a &#x26;lsquo;fuck you&#x26;rsquo; to tidy politics. That&#x26;#39;s what Garth&#x26;#39;s comics do, they really force you to think about what you believe and why you believe it &#x26;mdash; and if you should believe it, because is it really worth believing in?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;While it remains to be seen if audiences congregate every Sunday for &#x3C;i&#x3E;Preacher&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, should the series follow in the footsteps of &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Walking Dead&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; AMC&#x26;rsquo;s most popular show, also adapted from a comic book &#x26;mdash; Cooper feels confident the stage is set for a rich, multi-season journey. &#x26;ldquo;Playing Jesse for a long time doesn&#x26;#39;t feel daunting because &#x26;mdash; and this happens so rarely &#x26;mdash; each scene is like this little nugget of excellence that I can&#x26;#39;t wait to crack open,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x26;ldquo;One minute you&#x26;#39;ll adore him, and the next you&#x26;#39;ll think he&#x26;#39;s the most vile human being on Earth, given what he&#x26;#39;s capable of.

She was 14 years old when she was first nominated for an Oscar &mdash; for playing a prostitute in Martin Scorsese&#39;s <i>Taxi Driver</i> &mdash; and 26 when she won Best Actress for the first time, for the 1988 movie <i>The Accused</i>. She won again soon after for playing Clarice Starling &mdash; the character who created an entirely new archetype for a female hero &mdash; in 1991&#39;s <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>.</p><p>Given Foster&#39;s background, it is not surprising that she wanted to direct movies from a young age. In a recent interview in Beverly Hills, she called her childhood self \"a power-hungry 7-year-old\" who had learned early that directing was the way to get to realize \"the full vision of the film, and having every part of you expressed.\" She was not only in movies, but she was also a film buff. \"My mom took me to all these European films,\" Foster said. \"Lina Wertm&uuml;ller: That was the first time I had ever seen there was a woman director, and I loved those movies, and I would see them over and over and over again.\"</p><p>And so Foster started paying attention, she said, \"and saying, &#39;Why did he do that? Why did he choose <i>this</i>?&#39;\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr04/longform-14117-1463011417-7.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Jack O&#39;Connell as Kyle, with George Clooney as Lee.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>TriStar Pictures</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The fourth movie that Foster has directed, <i>Money Monster</i>, a hostage thriller reminiscent of &#39;70s films such as <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>, will be released on May 13. It co-stars George Clooney as Lee Gates, a cynical finance channel shill, who touts stocks without considering the consequences; Julia Roberts as Patty Fenn, the producer who has grown out of working with him; and Jack O&#39;Connell as Kyle, the angry, duped regular guy who blew his only cash on one of Lee&#39;s tips, and seizes control of the station, with a bomb and a gun, on live television.</p><p>Foster sat down with BuzzFeed News to discuss her directing career so far. She was open about how her films have reflected her life, and quick to laugh. She claimed she still enjoys being interviewed, even after all this time.</p><p>\"I like talking about the movies,\" she said. \"Who else am I going to talk to about them?\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p><b><i>Little Man Tate</i> (1991)</b></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr13/enhanced-mid-21810-1463011653-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Adam Hann-Byrd, Jodie Foster.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Orion Pictures Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><i>Little Man Tate</i> tells the story of a 7-year-old prodigy named Fred Tate (Adam Hann-Byrd) living in semi-squalor in Cincinnati with his waitress mother, Dede (Foster). Foster had been sent the script, written by Scott Frank, as an actor, but it piqued her interest as a possible first directing project.</p><p>\"They laughed about that,\" she said, without elaborating on who \"they\" were. She persisted, and found a way to get the movie financed with her directing and co-starring. Foster was 27 at the time, and credits her age with having the \"confidence, or maybe the bravado,\" not to question whether it was wise to direct both herself and a child who had never acted before. (Hann-Byrd had been discovered in a regular school, not through an agency.) \"The good news about being 27 years old is you&#39;re pretty unconscious, and you don&#39;t think about how hard it is what you&#39;re undertaking,\" she said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr05/longform-17136-1463011798-7.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"207\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Foster</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Orion Pictures Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Foster certainly had her own abundant experiences with directors as a child to guide her &mdash; especially on what <i>not</i> to do. \"There were lots of directors that worked with me that annoyed me, so I tried to avoid those techniques,\" she said. Later, she added: \"There&#39;s nothing that I love more than a director who knows what they want. But I especially didn&#39;t want to be manipulated or bullied. And bad things happen to me when I&#39;m bullied or manipulated. It&#39;s the one area where I really rebel, and my way of rebellion is I just get cold. I get cold and totally unemotional and I will not act.\"</p><p>Fred&#39;s story was particularly important to Foster. Though Dede, a single parent, is devoted to him, Fred is not thriving in public school, nor does he have any friends (his greatest desire). When a school for gifted children discovers Fred &mdash; who excels both at math and in the arts &mdash; Dede becomes competitive with Jane (Dianne Wiest), the condescending, socially inept head of the school. Their dynamic hurts Fred, but by the movie&#39;s end, Dede and Jane find a balance that serves both his mind and heart. It&#39;s a warm, sweet, intimate film that <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/little-man-tate-1991\">Roger Ebert described</a> as \"the kind of movie you enjoy watching; it&#39;s about interesting people finding out about themselves.\"</p><p>Foster saw her own past dilemmas in the arc of <i>Little Man Tate</i>. \"It&#39;s a personal movie even though it was written by somebody else; I feel like it&#39;s an auteur film,\" she said.</p><p>\"I really saw myself as somebody who was pulled in two different directions,\" Foster continued, describing her bifurcated childhood. \"I had this weird emotional intelligence about people, and why they do what they do and trying to figure out how to help take care of people. But I also really felt great joy, and lived in the world of my intellect.\"</p><p>Though <i>Little Man Tate</i> shows the audience some of Fred&#39;s talents, they&#39;re not the focus of the film &mdash; his awkward, poignant attempts to fit into the world are. It was a deliberate choice of Foster&#39;s. \"Some of the criticism of the movie was, like, <i>Wait a minute, this is a movie about a child genius: Why don&#39;t we talk about all the amazing things he does? Why don&#39;t we talk about his joy with math?</i>\" she said. \"I was, like, &lsquo;Well, I was a prodigy, and I don&#39;t want to talk about that. I want to talk about how lonely I was.&rsquo;\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr04/longform-15446-1463012167-5.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"484\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Dianne Wiest, Hann-Byrd, Foster.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Orion Pictures Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>But Foster is also critical of her directing work. With Wiest, she said, she tried to \"control her performance too much.\" Jane, a brilliant snob who begins to discover her maternal side with Fred, was a different sort of role for Wiest, who had played spaced-out, warm-hearted characters in <i>Footloose</i>, <i>Hannah and Her Sisters</i>, and <i>Parenthood</i>. \"She has this beautiful, kind of bubbling way about her where she kind of discovers the lines in the moment,\" Foster said of Wiest &mdash; and that couldn&#39;t be the case with Jane. \"I forced Dianne to be so meticulous and so rigid, and I know it wasn&#39;t her instinct,\" said Foster. \"And I still feel bad about it. But I think it&#39;s a great performance.\" Nevertheless, she said, \"I always apologize every time I see her.\"</p><p>Though Foster said the movie was &ldquo;na&iuml;ve,&rdquo; &ldquo;very plodding and black and white,&rdquo; and that she made her points &ldquo;in a <i>big</i> way,&rdquo; she&rsquo;s still proud of her directorial debut.</p><p>\"I think more than anything else, it just has a lot of heart,&rdquo; Foster said. \"And mostly because it came from a really personal place: the theme of being alone, and knowing that you&#39;re different, and knowing that you&#39;re never going to belong, and you&#39;re never going to be like everybody else. I think that was a theme in my life as a young person. It is as I grew up. And I was just starting to understand that then.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p><b><i>Home for the Holidays</i> (1995)</b></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr13/enhanced-mid-26327-1463012000-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"492\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Holly Hunter, Robert Downey Jr.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>After directing <i>Little Man Tate</i> &mdash; as well as winning that second Best Actress Oscar for <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> &mdash; Foster formed a production company, Egg, and entered into a deal with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, a studio that eventually merged with Universal. \"Failed moguldom&#33;\" she said with a loud laugh. \"I was following a path, and &mdash; I can&#39;t say I think it was a mistake? But it was a lot of energy output, and I think the energy would have been better spent in other places. When you&#39;re young, you try things.\"</p><p>She added: \"I think people thought I wanted to make big, mainstream movies, and the truth is I didn&#39;t. I just wanted to make movies that were relevant to me.\"</p><p><i>Nell</i> in 1994 was the first film that Foster and Egg produced, and it was set to be released just as she began to prepare to direct her next feature, <i>Home for the Holidays</i>, a drama/comedy about one loud, messy family&#39;s Thanksgiving weekend. Foster developed and starred in <i>Nell</i>, in addition to producing. It was an immersive performance, with Foster playing the title role of a young woman who had lived in isolation with her mother and created her own language before being discovered by doctors. \"<i>Nell</i> was tough,\" she said. \"People did not respond to the movie, they didn&#39;t like the movie. And I was really out there. I really put everything on the line.\"</p><p>Foster would go on to be nominated for Best Actress again for <i>Nell</i>, but as she absorbed the criticism of the movie, she dove into <i>Home for the Holidays</i>. \"It was a good way of curing the ills of an unsuccessful movie,\" she said.</p><p>Foster had bought <i>Home for the Holidays</i> after another company decided not to make it. It was based on a short story by Chris Radant, and she would be only behind the camera this time: no acting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-mid-5392-1463012084-1.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"392\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>From left: Steve Guttenberg, Charles Durning, Anne Bancroft, Cynthia Stevenson, Dylan McDermott, and Hunter.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Paramount</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The film stars Holly Hunter as Claudia, an art restorer in Chicago who is fired from her museum job just as she is about to head to her parents&#39; house for Thanksgiving. Once there, she is infantilized &mdash; if lovingly &mdash; by her eccentric parents, played by Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning. It was a large ensemble: The cast also included Robert Downey Jr. as Tommy, Claudia&#39;s charismatic, mercurial, gay brother; Dylan McDermott as Tommy&#39;s friend and Claudia&#39;s love interest; Cynthia Stevenson as Joanne, Claudia and Tommy&#39;s sourpuss sister; Claire Danes as Claudia&#39;s sophisticated teenage daughter; and various other family members of all embarrassing stripes.</p><p>With this crowd, the script ended up changing significantly during the rehearsal period before the movie began shooting, and Foster worked closely with screenwriter W.D. Richter (<i>The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension</i>). \"So much of the overlapping dialogue and their dynamic with each other was really important, mostly for shaping the screenplay,\" Foster said. At this late stage, as the actors, Richter, and Foster workshopped the script, the focus of the movie became the warm relationship between Claudia and Tommy. Hunter, Foster said, loved to \"react to other people.\" And so, \"it was about engineering things for Holly to react to &mdash; she was the person reacting to all this craziness around her.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr08/longform-18136-1463012250-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Downey</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Paramount</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Downey was in his wild-man days then, and was steps away from going into rehab (one of many times in the years to come). Yet the open process during <i>Home for the Holidays</i> served his talents well. \"He really fleshed out that character in a way that I wouldn&#39;t have been able to,\" Foster said. In her and Downey&#39;s hands, Tommy ended up being one of the most fully developed, realistic LGBT characters popular culture had yet seen: He is the object of his parents&#39; silent homophobia, and of his sister Joanne&#39;s more vicious strain, but he has found joy in his home life with his husband &mdash; <i>Home for the Holidays</i> features one of the first same-sex weddings in film.

The only person he connects to is his sister, mostly because she&#39;s an outsider as well.

But it was scrapped after Crowe injured himself right before shooting began, and Foster&#39;s subsequent efforts to get the movie going again did not work. As recently as 2008, she thought she still yearned to do it &mdash; until she realized that she actually didn&#39;t.</p><p>\"That was <i>many</i> years of my life,\" she said. \"And that was just a testament to a bad part of my personality too &mdash; that I can&#39;t let things go, and I just keep banging myself against a wall over and over and over again&#33; To the point where, 10 years down the line, I get that movie financed &mdash; I <i>finally</i> get that movie financed, again, for the third time &mdash; and I&#39;m about to get to the point where they&#39;re dropping the money into the escrow. And I go, like, <i>Wait a minute. I feel like I already made this movie. I feel like I grew out of this movie now&#33;</i>\"</p><p>Between <i>Home for the Holidays</i> and <i>The Beaver</i>, Foster also had two sons, who are now in their teens. \"I was really present for their lives,\" she said. \"And maybe because I&#39;m so focused &mdash; overly, hyperfocused on one thing &mdash; I think I was scared of leaving them, and focusing on that other thing.\" She continued: \"And I can&#39;t regret that. I don&#39;t regret that I was there every single day for every single thing that they did. And acting allowed me to do that. I couldn&#39;t do that being a director.\"</p><p>During the 2000s, she was in such movies as David Fincher&#39;s <i>Panic Room</i> (2002), Spike Lee&#39;s <i>Inside Man</i> (2006), and more &mdash; but the acting lessened too. \"I burned out a little,\" Foster said. \"I&#39;m not going to be one of those actors who&#39;s like, &#39;Oh, yeah, I&#39;m only going to give you five days, and we can&#39;t work past 5, and my kid&#39;s going to be in my trailer. I only shoot in L.A.&#39; That&#39;s not going to be me&#33; I&#39;m going to commit 100%. Otherwise, I don&#39;t know how to be good. It means that I only did one movie every three years.\"</p><p>Despite knowing why she made the choices she did, and what she was doing instead, Foster said she feels bad about how rarely she has directed. \"That&#39;s a big failure in my life, you know?\" she said. \"I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;ve directed so little, and I&#39;ve been in the business for so long, and I did my first movie when I was 27.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-19827-1463012404-3.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"323\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Riley Thomas Stewart and Gibson.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Summit Entertainment</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><i>The Beaver</i> by Kyle Killen was on the 2008 Black List, Franklin Leonard&#39;s annual survey of the most popular unproduced screenplays (as picked by Hollywood executives). It was the story of a depressed CEO named Walter Black whose breakdown is so acute that he is revived only when he begins speaking through a beaver puppet he wears on his hand. Before Foster signed on to direct, it was geared to be more of a comedy, and Steve Carell was set to star in it.</p><p>Foster did not see <i>The Beaver</i> that way. \"That was a very strong choice that I made that I know was not for everybody,\" she said. \"The movie that I loved was the drama about a man who&#39;s so broken and hates himself so much that he has to put a puppet on his hand in order to figure out how to survive. I wanted the darkness of it, and I wanted the emptiness of it to reflect who he was. I wanted it to be a film about mental illness.\"</p><p>Foster wanted Mel Gibson &mdash; her good friend, with whom she had starred in 1994&#39;s <i>Maverick</i> &mdash; to play Walter. Gibson&#39;s anti-Semitic outburst during a 2006 DUI arrest had put him on the fringes of the entertainment industry; and even before that, he had not starred in a movie since 2002&#39;s <i>Signs</i>. But he was Foster&#39;s first choice. \"He knows how to do comedy, and he has a light touch &mdash; and he&#39;s lovable. But he would really understand this movie from its darkest place. And that&#39;s really what I wanted to push him to do,\" she said.</p><p>Despite not liking acting in the films she directs, she cast herself as Walter&#39;s estranged wife, Meredith. \"I wanted to know that the person playing opposite him was going to honor the performance that he was giving and was going to be believable, and had the strength to stand opposite Mel Gibson,\" she said. Anton Yelchin played Porter, their high school&ndash;age son who despises Walter, and Riley Thomas Stewart was cast as Henry, their younger kid, who loves Walter and yearns for his attention.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web01/longform-13521-1463012773-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"126\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Jennifer Lawrence</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Summit Entertainment</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Kate Aurthur</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/jodie-foster-directing-career-retrospective</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:16:54 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">She&#x27;s directed Mel Gibson, Jennifer Lawrence, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and herself.

She was 14 years old when she was first nominated for an Oscar &#x26;mdash; for playing a prostitute in Martin Scorsese&#x26;#39;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Taxi Driver&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; and 26 when she won Best Actress for the first time, for the 1988 movie &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Accused&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. She won again soon after for playing Clarice Starling &#x26;mdash; the character who created an entirely new archetype for a female hero &#x26;mdash; in 1991&#x26;#39;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Silence of the Lambs&#x3C;/i&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Given Foster&#x26;#39;s background, it is not surprising that she wanted to direct movies from a young age. In a recent interview in Beverly Hills, she called her childhood self &#x22;a power-hungry 7-year-old&#x22; who had learned early that directing was the way to get to realize &#x22;the full vision of the film, and having every part of you expressed.&#x22; She was not only in movies, but she was also a film buff. &#x22;My mom took me to all these European films,&#x22; Foster said. &#x22;Lina Wertm&#x26;uuml;ller: That was the first time I had ever seen there was a woman director, and I loved those movies, and I would see them over and over and over again.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;And so Foster started paying attention, she said, &#x22;and saying, &#x26;#39;Why did he do that? Why did he choose &#x3C;i&#x3E;this&#x3C;/i&#x3E;?&#x26;#39;&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr04/longform-14117-1463011417-7.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;300&#x22; height=&#x22;200&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Jack O&#x26;#39;Connell as Kyle, with George Clooney as Lee.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;TriStar Pictures&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;The fourth movie that Foster has directed, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Money Monster&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, a hostage thriller reminiscent of &#x26;#39;70s films such as &#x3C;i&#x3E;Dog Day Afternoon&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, will be released on May 13. It co-stars George Clooney as Lee Gates, a cynical finance channel shill, who touts stocks without considering the consequences; Julia Roberts as Patty Fenn, the producer who has grown out of working with him; and Jack O&#x26;#39;Connell as Kyle, the angry, duped regular guy who blew his only cash on one of Lee&#x26;#39;s tips, and seizes control of the station, with a bomb and a gun, on live television.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Foster sat down with BuzzFeed News to discuss her directing career so far. She was open about how her films have reflected her life, and quick to laugh. She claimed she still enjoys being interviewed, even after all this time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;I like talking about the movies,&#x22; she said. &#x22;Who else am I going to talk to about them?&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Little Man Tate&#x3C;/i&#x3E; (1991)&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr13/enhanced-mid-21810-1463011653-1.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;478&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Adam Hann-Byrd, Jodie Foster.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Orion Pictures Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Little Man Tate&#x3C;/i&#x3E; tells the story of a 7-year-old prodigy named Fred Tate (Adam Hann-Byrd) living in semi-squalor in Cincinnati with his waitress mother, Dede (Foster). Foster had been sent the script, written by Scott Frank, as an actor, but it piqued her interest as a possible first directing project.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;They laughed about that,&#x22; she said, without elaborating on who &#x22;they&#x22; were. She persisted, and found a way to get the movie financed with her directing and co-starring. Foster was 27 at the time, and credits her age with having the &#x22;confidence, or maybe the bravado,&#x22; not to question whether it was wise to direct both herself and a child who had never acted before. (Hann-Byrd had been discovered in a regular school, not through an agency.) &#x22;The good news about being 27 years old is you&#x26;#39;re pretty unconscious, and you don&#x26;#39;t think about how hard it is what you&#x26;#39;re undertaking,&#x22; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr05/longform-17136-1463011798-7.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;300&#x22; height=&#x22;207&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Foster&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Orion Pictures Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Foster certainly had her own abundant experiences with directors as a child to guide her &#x26;mdash; especially on what &#x3C;i&#x3E;not&#x3C;/i&#x3E; to do. &#x22;There were lots of directors that worked with me that annoyed me, so I tried to avoid those techniques,&#x22; she said. Later, she added: &#x22;There&#x26;#39;s nothing that I love more than a director who knows what they want. But I especially didn&#x26;#39;t want to be manipulated or bullied. And bad things happen to me when I&#x26;#39;m bullied or manipulated. It&#x26;#39;s the one area where I really rebel, and my way of rebellion is I just get cold. I get cold and totally unemotional and I will not act.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Fred&#x26;#39;s story was particularly important to Foster. Though Dede, a single parent, is devoted to him, Fred is not thriving in public school, nor does he have any friends (his greatest desire). When a school for gifted children discovers Fred &#x26;mdash; who excels both at math and in the arts &#x26;mdash; Dede becomes competitive with Jane (Dianne Wiest), the condescending, socially inept head of the school. Their dynamic hurts Fred, but by the movie&#x26;#39;s end, Dede and Jane find a balance that serves both his mind and heart. It&#x26;#39;s a warm, sweet, intimate film that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/little-man-tate-1991&#x22;&#x3E;Roger Ebert described&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as &#x22;the kind of movie you enjoy watching; it&#x26;#39;s about interesting people finding out about themselves.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Foster saw her own past dilemmas in the arc of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Little Man Tate&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. &#x22;It&#x26;#39;s a personal movie even though it was written by somebody else; I feel like it&#x26;#39;s an auteur film,&#x22; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;I really saw myself as somebody who was pulled in two different directions,&#x22; Foster continued, describing her bifurcated childhood. &#x22;I had this weird emotional intelligence about people, and why they do what they do and trying to figure out how to help take care of people. But I also really felt great joy, and lived in the world of my intellect.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Though &#x3C;i&#x3E;Little Man Tate&#x3C;/i&#x3E; shows the audience some of Fred&#x26;#39;s talents, they&#x26;#39;re not the focus of the film &#x26;mdash; his awkward, poignant attempts to fit into the world are. It was a deliberate choice of Foster&#x26;#39;s. &#x22;Some of the criticism of the movie was, like, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Wait a minute, this is a movie about a child genius: Why don&#x26;#39;t we talk about all the amazing things he does? Why don&#x26;#39;t we talk about his joy with math?&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x22; she said. &#x22;I was, like, &#x26;lsquo;Well, I was a prodigy, and I don&#x26;#39;t want to talk about that. I want to talk about how lonely I was.&#x26;rsquo;&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr04/longform-15446-1463012167-5.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;484&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Dianne Wiest, Hann-Byrd, Foster.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Orion Pictures Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;But Foster is also critical of her directing work. With Wiest, she said, she tried to &#x22;control her performance too much.&#x22; Jane, a brilliant snob who begins to discover her maternal side with Fred, was a different sort of role for Wiest, who had played spaced-out, warm-hearted characters in &#x3C;i&#x3E;Footloose&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Hannah and Her Sisters&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Parenthood&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. &#x22;She has this beautiful, kind of bubbling way about her where she kind of discovers the lines in the moment,&#x22; Foster said of Wiest &#x26;mdash; and that couldn&#x26;#39;t be the case with Jane. &#x22;I forced Dianne to be so meticulous and so rigid, and I know it wasn&#x26;#39;t her instinct,&#x22; said Foster. &#x22;And I still feel bad about it. But I think it&#x26;#39;s a great performance.&#x22; Nevertheless, she said, &#x22;I always apologize every time I see her.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Though Foster said the movie was &#x26;ldquo;na&#x26;iuml;ve,&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;ldquo;very plodding and black and white,&#x26;rdquo; and that she made her points &#x26;ldquo;in a &#x3C;i&#x3E;big&#x3C;/i&#x3E; way,&#x26;rdquo; she&#x26;rsquo;s still proud of her directorial debut.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;I think more than anything else, it just has a lot of heart,&#x26;rdquo; Foster said. &#x22;And mostly because it came from a really personal place: the theme of being alone, and knowing that you&#x26;#39;re different, and knowing that you&#x26;#39;re never going to belong, and you&#x26;#39;re never going to be like everybody else. I think that was a theme in my life as a young person. It is as I grew up. And I was just starting to understand that then.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Home for the Holidays&#x3C;/i&#x3E; (1995)&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr13/enhanced-mid-26327-1463012000-1.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;492&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Holly Hunter, Robert Downey Jr.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;After directing &#x3C;i&#x3E;Little Man Tate&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; as well as winning that second Best Actress Oscar for &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Silence of the Lambs&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; Foster formed a production company, Egg, and entered into a deal with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, a studio that eventually merged with Universal. &#x22;Failed moguldom&#x26;#33;&#x22; she said with a loud laugh. &#x22;I was following a path, and &#x26;mdash; I can&#x26;#39;t say I think it was a mistake? But it was a lot of energy output, and I think the energy would have been better spent in other places. When you&#x26;#39;re young, you try things.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;She added: &#x22;I think people thought I wanted to make big, mainstream movies, and the truth is I didn&#x26;#39;t. I just wanted to make movies that were relevant to me.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Nell&#x3C;/i&#x3E; in 1994 was the first film that Foster and Egg produced, and it was set to be released just as she began to prepare to direct her next feature, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Home for the Holidays&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, a drama/comedy about one loud, messy family&#x26;#39;s Thanksgiving weekend. Foster developed and starred in &#x3C;i&#x3E;Nell&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, in addition to producing. It was an immersive performance, with Foster playing the title role of a young woman who had lived in isolation with her mother and created her own language before being discovered by doctors. &#x22;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Nell&#x3C;/i&#x3E; was tough,&#x22; she said. &#x22;People did not respond to the movie, they didn&#x26;#39;t like the movie. And I was really out there. I really put everything on the line.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Foster would go on to be nominated for Best Actress again for &#x3C;i&#x3E;Nell&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, but as she absorbed the criticism of the movie, she dove into &#x3C;i&#x3E;Home for the Holidays&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. &#x22;It was a good way of curing the ills of an unsuccessful movie,&#x22; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Foster had bought &#x3C;i&#x3E;Home for the Holidays&#x3C;/i&#x3E; after another company decided not to make it. It was based on a short story by Chris Radant, and she would be only behind the camera this time: no acting.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-mid-5392-1463012084-1.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;392&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;From left: Steve Guttenberg, Charles Durning, Anne Bancroft, Cynthia Stevenson, Dylan McDermott, and Hunter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Paramount&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;The film stars Holly Hunter as Claudia, an art restorer in Chicago who is fired from her museum job just as she is about to head to her parents&#x26;#39; house for Thanksgiving. Once there, she is infantilized &#x26;mdash; if lovingly &#x26;mdash; by her eccentric parents, played by Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning. It was a large ensemble: The cast also included Robert Downey Jr. as Tommy, Claudia&#x26;#39;s charismatic, mercurial, gay brother; Dylan McDermott as Tommy&#x26;#39;s friend and Claudia&#x26;#39;s love interest; Cynthia Stevenson as Joanne, Claudia and Tommy&#x26;#39;s sourpuss sister; Claire Danes as Claudia&#x26;#39;s sophisticated teenage daughter; and various other family members of all embarrassing stripes.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;With this crowd, the script ended up changing significantly during the rehearsal period before the movie began shooting, and Foster worked closely with screenwriter W.D. Richter (&#x3C;i&#x3E;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&#x3C;/i&#x3E;). &#x22;So much of the overlapping dialogue and their dynamic with each other was really important, mostly for shaping the screenplay,&#x22; Foster said. At this late stage, as the actors, Richter, and Foster workshopped the script, the focus of the movie became the warm relationship between Claudia and Tommy. Hunter, Foster said, loved to &#x22;react to other people.&#x22; And so, &#x22;it was about engineering things for Holly to react to &#x26;mdash; she was the person reacting to all this craziness around her.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr08/longform-18136-1463012250-1.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;300&#x22; height=&#x22;167&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Downey&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Paramount&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Downey was in his wild-man days then, and was steps away from going into rehab (one of many times in the years to come). Yet the open process during &#x3C;i&#x3E;Home for the Holidays&#x3C;/i&#x3E; served his talents well. &#x22;He really fleshed out that character in a way that I wouldn&#x26;#39;t have been able to,&#x22; Foster said. In her and Downey&#x26;#39;s hands, Tommy ended up being one of the most fully developed, realistic LGBT characters popular culture had yet seen: He is the object of his parents&#x26;#39; silent homophobia, and of his sister Joanne&#x26;#39;s more vicious strain, but he has found joy in his home life with his husband &#x26;mdash; &#x3C;i&#x3E;Home for the Holidays&#x3C;/i&#x3E; features one of the first same-sex weddings in film. (Foster &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/jodie-fosters-coming-out-speech-at-the-golden-glo?utm_term=.nyB3Ew22O3#.xiMZp5EEDZ&#x22;&#x3E;came out&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of her own &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2013/01/7176703/jodie-foster-now-unquestionably-out-except-maybe-times&#x22;&#x3E;glass closet&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in 2013 at the Golden Globe Awards.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;He&#x26;#39;s a verbal guy who can live performatively on the outside of his body,&#x22; Foster said of Downey and the creation of Tommy. &#x22;But there&#x26;#39;s also such pain in that character, knowing that he&#x26;#39;ll never really be able to talk to his father, and that his mother is busy ignoring who he really is. The only person he connects to is his sister, mostly because she&#x26;#39;s an outsider as well.

But it was scrapped after Crowe injured himself right before shooting began, and Foster&#x26;#39;s subsequent efforts to get the movie going again did not work. As recently as 2008, she thought she still yearned to do it &#x26;mdash; until she realized that she actually didn&#x26;#39;t.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;That was &#x3C;i&#x3E;many&#x3C;/i&#x3E; years of my life,&#x22; she said. &#x22;And that was just a testament to a bad part of my personality too &#x26;mdash; that I can&#x26;#39;t let things go, and I just keep banging myself against a wall over and over and over again&#x26;#33; To the point where, 10 years down the line, I get that movie financed &#x26;mdash; I &#x3C;i&#x3E;finally&#x3C;/i&#x3E; get that movie financed, again, for the third time &#x26;mdash; and I&#x26;#39;m about to get to the point where they&#x26;#39;re dropping the money into the escrow. And I go, like, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Wait a minute. I feel like I already made this movie. I feel like I grew out of this movie now&#x26;#33;&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Between &#x3C;i&#x3E;Home for the Holidays&#x3C;/i&#x3E; and &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Beaver&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, Foster also had two sons, who are now in their teens. &#x22;I was really present for their lives,&#x22; she said. &#x22;And maybe because I&#x26;#39;m so focused &#x26;mdash; overly, hyperfocused on one thing &#x26;mdash; I think I was scared of leaving them, and focusing on that other thing.&#x22; She continued: &#x22;And I can&#x26;#39;t regret that. I don&#x26;#39;t regret that I was there every single day for every single thing that they did. And acting allowed me to do that. I couldn&#x26;#39;t do that being a director.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;During the 2000s, she was in such movies as David Fincher&#x26;#39;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Panic Room&#x3C;/i&#x3E; (2002), Spike Lee&#x26;#39;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Inside Man&#x3C;/i&#x3E; (2006), and more &#x26;mdash; but the acting lessened too. &#x22;I burned out a little,&#x22; Foster said. &#x22;I&#x26;#39;m not going to be one of those actors who&#x26;#39;s like, &#x26;#39;Oh, yeah, I&#x26;#39;m only going to give you five days, and we can&#x26;#39;t work past 5, and my kid&#x26;#39;s going to be in my trailer. I only shoot in L.A.&#x26;#39; That&#x26;#39;s not going to be me&#x26;#33; I&#x26;#39;m going to commit 100%. Otherwise, I don&#x26;#39;t know how to be good. It means that I only did one movie every three years.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Despite knowing why she made the choices she did, and what she was doing instead, Foster said she feels bad about how rarely she has directed. &#x22;That&#x26;#39;s a big failure in my life, you know?&#x22; she said. &#x22;I can&#x26;#39;t believe that I&#x26;#39;ve directed so little, and I&#x26;#39;ve been in the business for so long, and I did my first movie when I was 27.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/20/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-19827-1463012404-3.png&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;323&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Riley Thomas Stewart and Gibson.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Summit Entertainment&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;The Beaver&#x3C;/i&#x3E; by Kyle Killen was on the 2008 Black List, Franklin Leonard&#x26;#39;s annual survey of the most popular unproduced screenplays (as picked by Hollywood executives). It was the story of a depressed CEO named Walter Black whose breakdown is so acute that he is revived only when he begins speaking through a beaver puppet he wears on his hand. Before Foster signed on to direct, it was geared to be more of a comedy, and Steve Carell was set to star in it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Foster did not see &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Beaver&#x3C;/i&#x3E; that way. &#x22;That was a very strong choice that I made that I know was not for everybody,&#x22; she said. &#x22;The movie that I loved was the drama about a man who&#x26;#39;s so broken and hates himself so much that he has to put a puppet on his hand in order to figure out how to survive. I wanted the darkness of it, and I wanted the emptiness of it to reflect who he was. I wanted it to be a film about mental illness.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Foster wanted Mel Gibson &#x26;mdash; her good friend, with whom she had starred in 1994&#x26;#39;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Maverick&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; to play Walter. Gibson&#x26;#39;s anti-Semitic outburst during a 2006 DUI arrest had put him on the fringes of the entertainment industry; and even before that, he had not starred in a movie since 2002&#x26;#39;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Signs&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. But he was Foster&#x26;#39;s first choice. &#x22;He knows how to do comedy, and he has a light touch &#x26;mdash; and he&#x26;#39;s lovable. But he would really understand this movie from its darkest place. And that&#x26;#39;s really what I wanted to push him to do,&#x22; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Despite not liking acting in the films she directs, she cast herself as Walter&#x26;#39;s estranged wife, Meredith. &#x22;I wanted to know that the person playing opposite him was going to honor the performance that he was giving and was going to be believable, and had the strength to stand opposite Mel Gibson,&#x22; she said.

A minute later, the blue powers of its title villain, n&eacute; En Sabah Nur, seep inside of him and take him over as part of a consciousness-transferring, body-snatching procedure, and Isaac spends the rest of the movie encased in blue makeup and bewildering motivations as he seeks to remake the world and reappoint himself as its god.<br /></p><p>Isaac isn&#39;t the only big name to have been woven into the franchise &mdash; <i>Apocalypse</i>, like the two previous movies, flounders at giving Jennifer Lawrence (way more famous now than when she appeared in 2011&#39;s <i>X-Men: First Class</i>) more non-blue screen time and a place of prominence. But Isaac&#39;s appearance in the film seems a particular waste after he proved himself so resoundingly last year as both an actor and a heartthrob. It&#39;s not just that you can barely see Isaac; it&#39;s that Apocalypse is such an incredible letdown as a foe, with his fixation on being worshipped, the amount of time he spends recruiting an entourage, and, frankly, the micromanaging attention he gives his henchmen&#39;s various new looks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr09/longform-22861-1462993170-8.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Michael Fassbender</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Alan Markfield / 20th Century Fox</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>For an ancient antagonist reaching back to the dawn of time &mdash; the first mutant&#33; The baddest bad to have ever badded&#33; &mdash; Apocalypse is neither frightening nor memorable, aside from the way he personally applies the facial decal on one of his four followers. After emerging in 1983 following millennia of being buried underground, Apocalypse catches up on the current status of the planet by absorbing it through a television. \"Learrrning,\" he groans, like a very drunk Leeloo from <i>The Fifth Element</i>. Getting to the \"war part,\" he <i>likes it</i>, and he decides unworthy humans have been in charge for too long and it&#39;s time for him to put mutants back on top. He turns people into sand. He&#39;s camp, but the rest of the movie isn&#39;t &mdash; the rest of the movie tries to parcel out earnest angst to its many, many characters, leaning on recognition from past <i>X-Men</i> installments to give them a wholeness that the film doesn&#39;t have time to fill out itself.</p><p>The biggest recipient is Magneto (Michael Fassbender), who&#39;s gone to ground since <i>Days of Future Past</i>, hiding in Eastern Europe, married with a daughter and a factory job. That life is taken from him, abruptly and awfully, in what is essentially a police shooting after he outs himself as a mutant by saving someone at work. It&#39;s one of the few instances of regular ol&#39; humanity in the movie, and it&#39;s only in the context of a character careening back to wanting to destroy it. Fassbender is the tormented heart of the <i>X-Men</i> prequels, imbuing his character with soulful tragedy (and still giving the best \"I&#39;m using my superpowers\" grimace in the business), but he struggles to bring freshness to Magneto&#39;s latest cycle of destroy/remorse in this sequel, even when he levels Auschwitz with new, Apocalypse-issued strength. It&#39;s a scene that should be audacious, but instead is a shrug, the wreckage spiraling prettily into the air &mdash; his powers are bigger, but not more meaningful.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-22707-1462993217-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Sophie Turner, Kodi Smit-McPhee, and Tye Sheridan.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>20th Century Fox</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><i>Apocalypse</i> director Bryan Singer&#39;s always had a way with the beats between the action, the ones that made mutantism such an all-purpose stand-in for the targets of intolerance &mdash; Iceman&#39;s \"coming out\" to his parents in <i>X2</i>; Rogue&#39;s fear that her own body and sexuality were deadly in the <i>X-Men</i> world, when her first kiss sent someone into a coma; Mystique spitting about how \"people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child\"; Magneto&#39;s powers rumbling to life in that Nazi concentration camp. But in <i>Apocalypse</i>, the \"you&#39;re with us or against us\" of it all is as abstract as that scene of Magneto vowing a new genocide while obliterating the site of a past one. The baby mutants &mdash; like Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) &mdash; have little interaction with the outside world after their introductions. In the big finish, we&#39;re given flashes of some worried faces in a war room to provide a reminder of the mostly offscreen stakes of the battle.</p><p><i>Apocalypse</i> focuses on mutant-on-mutant action, with Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters, once again getting the best scene in the movie), Mystique (Lawrence, looking uncharacteristically at sea), and Xavier (James McAvoy) on one side and Apocalypse and his horsemen Angel (Ben Hardy), Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn, weakest of the bunch), and Magneto on the other. But Apocalypse is so silly, and his actions are so lacking the pained resonance of past movies&#39; clashes &mdash; that fundamental schism over what&#39;s best for mutantkind &mdash; that it hardly matters.

A minute later, the blue powers of its title villain, n&#x26;eacute; En Sabah Nur, seep inside of him and take him over as part of a consciousness-transferring, body-snatching procedure, and Isaac spends the rest of the movie encased in blue makeup and bewildering motivations as he seeks to remake the world and reappoint himself as its god.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Isaac isn&#x26;#39;t the only big name to have been woven into the franchise &#x26;mdash; &#x3C;i&#x3E;Apocalypse&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, like the two previous movies, flounders at giving Jennifer Lawrence (way more famous now than when she appeared in 2011&#x26;#39;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;X-Men: First Class&#x3C;/i&#x3E;) more non-blue screen time and a place of prominence. But Isaac&#x26;#39;s appearance in the film seems a particular waste after he proved himself so resoundingly last year as both an actor and a heartthrob. It&#x26;#39;s not just that you can barely see Isaac; it&#x26;#39;s that Apocalypse is such an incredible letdown as a foe, with his fixation on being worshipped, the amount of time he spends recruiting an entourage, and, frankly, the micromanaging attention he gives his henchmen&#x26;#39;s various new looks.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/14/enhanced/webdr09/longform-22861-1462993170-8.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;300&#x22; height=&#x22;201&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Michael Fassbender&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Alan Markfield / 20th Century Fox&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;For an ancient antagonist reaching back to the dawn of time &#x26;mdash; the first mutant&#x26;#33; The baddest bad to have ever badded&#x26;#33; &#x26;mdash; Apocalypse is neither frightening nor memorable, aside from the way he personally applies the facial decal on one of his four followers. After emerging in 1983 following millennia of being buried underground, Apocalypse catches up on the current status of the planet by absorbing it through a television. &#x22;Learrrning,&#x22; he groans, like a very drunk Leeloo from &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Fifth Element&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. Getting to the &#x22;war part,&#x22; he &#x3C;i&#x3E;likes it&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, and he decides unworthy humans have been in charge for too long and it&#x26;#39;s time for him to put mutants back on top. He turns people into sand. He&#x26;#39;s camp, but the rest of the movie isn&#x26;#39;t &#x26;mdash; the rest of the movie tries to parcel out earnest angst to its many, many characters, leaning on recognition from past &#x3C;i&#x3E;X-Men&#x3C;/i&#x3E; installments to give them a wholeness that the film doesn&#x26;#39;t have time to fill out itself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The biggest recipient is Magneto (Michael Fassbender), who&#x26;#39;s gone to ground since &#x3C;i&#x3E;Days of Future Past&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, hiding in Eastern Europe, married with a daughter and a factory job. That life is taken from him, abruptly and awfully, in what is essentially a police shooting after he outs himself as a mutant by saving someone at work. It&#x26;#39;s one of the few instances of regular ol&#x26;#39; humanity in the movie, and it&#x26;#39;s only in the context of a character careening back to wanting to destroy it. Fassbender is the tormented heart of the &#x3C;i&#x3E;X-Men&#x3C;/i&#x3E; prequels, imbuing his character with soulful tragedy (and still giving the best &#x22;I&#x26;#39;m using my superpowers&#x22; grimace in the business), but he struggles to bring freshness to Magneto&#x26;#39;s latest cycle of destroy/remorse in this sequel, even when he levels Auschwitz with new, Apocalypse-issued strength. It&#x26;#39;s a scene that should be audacious, but instead is a shrug, the wreckage spiraling prettily into the air &#x26;mdash; his powers are bigger, but not more meaningful.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/11/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-22707-1462993217-1.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;300&#x22; height=&#x22;158&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sophie Turner, Kodi Smit-McPhee, and Tye Sheridan.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;20th Century Fox&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Apocalypse&#x3C;/i&#x3E; director Bryan Singer&#x26;#39;s always had a way with the beats between the action, the ones that made mutantism such an all-purpose stand-in for the targets of intolerance &#x26;mdash; Iceman&#x26;#39;s &#x22;coming out&#x22; to his parents in &#x3C;i&#x3E;X2&#x3C;/i&#x3E;; Rogue&#x26;#39;s fear that her own body and sexuality were deadly in the &#x3C;i&#x3E;X-Men&#x3C;/i&#x3E; world, when her first kiss sent someone into a coma; Mystique spitting about how &#x22;people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child&#x22;; Magneto&#x26;#39;s powers rumbling to life in that Nazi concentration camp. But in &#x3C;i&#x3E;Apocalypse&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, the &#x22;you&#x26;#39;re with us or against us&#x22; of it all is as abstract as that scene of Magneto vowing a new genocide while obliterating the site of a past one. The baby mutants &#x26;mdash; like Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) &#x26;mdash; have little interaction with the outside world after their introductions. In the big finish, we&#x26;#39;re given flashes of some worried faces in a war room to provide a reminder of the mostly offscreen stakes of the battle.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Apocalypse&#x3C;/i&#x3E; focuses on mutant-on-mutant action, with Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters, once again getting the best scene in the movie), Mystique (Lawrence, looking uncharacteristically at sea), and Xavier (James McAvoy) on one side and Apocalypse and his horsemen Angel (Ben Hardy), Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn, weakest of the bunch), and Magneto on the other. But Apocalypse is so silly, and his actions are so lacking the pained resonance of past movies&#x26;#39; clashes &#x26;mdash; that fundamental schism over what&#x26;#39;s best for mutantkind &#x26;mdash; that it hardly matters. They fight, and some change their mind, and for some, it wasn&#x26;#39;t clear why they were fighting in the first place.

Women and U.N. Under-Secretary Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka; actor-producer and abortion rights activist Amy Brenneman; and recently elected Flint Mayor Karen Weaver. Each recipient explained feminist activism from their varying perspectives. Lakshmi Puri, who accepted the award on behalf of Mlambo-Ngcuka, discussed global movements on equal pay for equal work, women&#39;s unpaid care burden, and the fight against child marriage, among other issues. Brenneman spoke on her public disclosure of an abortion she does not regret, and her continued involvement in the fight to keep the procedure safe and accessible in the U.S. Weaver has been reckoning with the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, caused by gross mismanagement that she later in the evening implied was criminal.<br /></p><p>Ferrera, who produces NBC&#39;s <i>Superstore</i> in addition to starring in it, focused her acceptance speech on role models.</p>\n\n<p>The very first film I did, <i>Real Women Have Curves</i>, received a response from so many &mdash; not just women, not just Latinas, all kinds of people from around the world who saw themselves. And I realized what I already knew as a young person, the power of seeing ourselves, being shown ourselves, being shown our own potential as women, as human beings, as people of color, as people from disadvantaged backgrounds. It was life-changing, to know that what I love to do and the talent that I had so desperately wanted to express had the potential to be a tool. A tool for helping other people find their voices. It was then that I went from wanting to be a famous, successful actress to wanting my work to matter. ... It&#39;s not easy out there for most of us who don&#39;t look like the one thing you are supposed to look like in this industry. To find roles that honor our intelligence and our humanity and our passion, and our real-life roles. When you find them, it really is a gift, and when you find people who are willing to also dedicate their time and their lives and their careers to creating those types of images, not just for us, but for our children, it&#39;s such a gift to know them and to work with them. ... I was moderating a conversation once among young women, and there was something that a young girl said that has really stayed with me. She stood up and she asked one of our panelists &mdash; she was in junior high &mdash; and she said, \"I was on the chess team. I was really good. But I was the only girl on the chess team, and it felt hard to be there, so I quit.\" And I haven&#39;t been able to shake that. Because if we can&#39;t get our young girls to stay in the room for the chess team, how are we gonna get them to stay in the room to be leaders in business, leaders in politics, leaders in medicine, leaders in science? We have a really big job to do, and part of that is creating role models. Creating people that our young women and young men can look up to and say, \"I can be that.\"</p>\n\n<p>During a panel discussion later in the evening, apparent Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was discussed in terms of presenting children poor role models. \"We have young children coming home from school; kindergarteners, coming home from school being told by their fellow kindergarteners, &#39;My mom says that when Donald Trump becomes president, he&#39;s gonna deport you and your family,&#39;\" Ferrera said. \"It&#39;s not happening in a vacuum. We are teaching a young generation what it means to be American.\"</p><p>Ferrera, who is a celebrity spokesperson for voter mobilization nonprofit Voto Latino, also addressed DREAMers (undocumented people who came to the U.S. as minors) in the forthcoming national election. The Obama administration&#39;s policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) allows DREAMers to apply for a renewable work permit and exemption from deportation. Ferrera notes that in the fight for policies to help DREAMers and their families, many have come forward and publicly identified as undocumented and, thus, there is an enormous amount at stake if the policies don&#39;t survive in the next administration: \"These young people now have given the government their names, their addresses, and fear retaliation. And so we have to do our best to make sure that that is not the case. ... Someone asked me outside, on the step and repeat, &#39;Does this frighten you? Everything that&#39;s happening, does it frighten you?&#39; More than anything, it saddens me. I was born and raised to be so grateful that I lived in a country where my ideas meant that I belonged, and what we&#39;re seeing now is that we&#39;re being told that&#39;s not the case, that no matter how much you want to be American, no matter how hard you want to work, no matter how much you have to contribute, the color of your skin, where you were born, the language you speak make you undesirable.\"</p><p>\"When you talk about the immigration issue, immigration is a feminist issue as well, and we need to start thinking about it as such,\" she said.<br /></p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Ariane Lange</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/america-ferrera</guid>\n<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 18:07:49 -0400</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;Immigration is a feminist issue,&#x22; the actor, producer, and activist said at the Feminist Majority Foundation&#x27;s Global Women&#x27;s Rights Awards.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">arianelange</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/10/18/campaign_images/webdr11/america-ferrera-2-1249-1462918576-2.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n  <media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/10/12/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-10234-1462899478-11.jpg&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;943&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;America Ferrera at the 11th Annual Global Women&#x26;#39;s Rights Awards at the Directors Guild of America.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Alberto E.

Either way, the cast is terrific, with &#x3C;i&#x3E;Blue Is the Warmest Color&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x27;s Ad&#xE8;le Exarchopoulos, Jared Harris, and Jean Reno in supporting roles.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"350\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/9/9/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-7916-1462800426-2.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Kristen Stewart&#x27;s transformation from YA star to arthouse darling continues apace with two movies at Cannes this year. One, alas, is the new Woody Allen movie &#x2014; &#x3C;b&#x3E;(8) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Caf&#xE9; Society&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;, in which Stewart joins Jesse Eisenberg for their third onscreen romance, this time in 1930s Hollywood and New York. If you haven&#x27;t already bailed on Allen or been chased away &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/woody-allen-interview-he-wont-889678&#x22;&#x3E;by his comments about his marriage in his most recent interview&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, you can &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl4X6pFfmTI&#x22;&#x3E;check out this trailer&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, which makes the film look like a less buoyant sibling to &#x3C;i&#x3E;Hail, Caesar!&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. Stewart plays the assistant of a powerful agent (Steve Carell), with Blake Lively holding up the other point of a love triangle with Eisenberg&#x27;s character.\n\nIn 2014&#x27;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Clouds of Sils Maria&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, Stewart also played an assistant, then working for an actor (Juliette Binoche). The role highlighted her strengths in a way few others have, particularly her restless naturalism. She reunites with director Olivier Assayas for &#x3C;b&#x3E;(9) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Personal Shopper&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; (pictured), once again playing someone employed in a celebrity-adjacent field. This time, though, there&#x27;s a supernatural twist: Stewart&#x27;s character, Maureen, has a late twin who could communicate with spirits, an ability she might share. Besides, fashion-centric ghost story is a seriously under-explored genre.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"350\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/10/2/enhanced/webdr15/enhanced-2371-1462860671-5.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Indie legend Jim Jarmusch, of the ferocious deadpan and the fantastic hair, also has two movies at Cannes. The first, &#x3C;b&#x3E;(10) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Paterson&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; (pictured), stars Adam Driver as a New Jersey bus driver and poet who shares a name with the movie and the city in which he lives. Driver seems like a perfect fit for Jarmusch&#x27;s dry sensibilities, and he&#x27;ll share the screen with the excellent Iranian actor Golshifteh Farahani, who plays his wife. \n\nJarmusch&#x27;s other film in the festival is a documentary, &#x3C;b&#x3E;(11) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Gimme Danger&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;, about the life and legacy of the Stooges. And while there are more than enough docs being made about musicians these days, Jarmusch doesn&#x27;t seem like the kind of filmmaker to just trudge dutifully through the lives of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll greats.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"350\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/9/10/enhanced/webdr03/enhanced-18935-1462803468-1.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">While other festivals pack their midnight sections with slashers and strangeness, last year Cannes programmed Asif Kapadia&#x27;s Oscar-winning Amy Winehouse doc &#x3C;i&#x3E;Amy&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. This is to say, Cannes isn&#x27;t known for genre films. But the fest and its parallel programs have been known to surface the occasional horror gem, like the gorgeous and terrifying sexually transmitted ghost story &#x3C;i&#x3E;It Follows&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, which premiered during Critics&#x2019; Week in 2014 and turned out to be one of the best horror films in recent memory. This year&#x27;s intriguing prospect is &#x3C;b&#x3E;(12) &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Transfiguration&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; (pictured), a New York&#x2013;set vampire movie that&#x27;s the first feature from writer/director Michael O&#x27;Shea. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.indiewire.com/article/michael-oshea-vampire-movie-2016-cannes-film-festival-the-transfiguration&#x22;&#x3E;O&#x27;Shea has described &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Transfiguration&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as an indie drama as much as it is a horror movie. Keep an eye out for the relative newcomers as its leads: Eric Ruffin, who plays 14-year-old Milo, and Chloe Levine.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"350\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/9/13/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-6508-1462814427-1.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Brit filmmaker Andrea Arnold&#x27;s 2009 film &#x3C;i&#x3E;Fish Tank&#x3C;/i&#x3E; was a searingly good portrait of a teenage girl. It starred first-time actor Katie Jarvis alongside a just-about-to-break-big Michael Fassbender, who was at his snaky best as a man whose relationship with his girlfriend&#x27;s neglected 15-year-old daughter wavers between encouraging and inappropriate. So the prospect of another teen portrait from Arnold is more than encouraging. Her new film, &#x3C;b&#x3E;(13) &#x3C;i&#x3E;American Honey&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; (pictured), has the added benefit of being a road-trip movie that plunks its heroine, Star (Sasha Lane, another newcomer), into the unstable world of sales crews taken around the country to sell magazine subscriptions. The group she falls into is young and raucous, and includes characters played by Shia LaBeouf, Riley Keough, and Arielle Holmes, star of last year&#x27;s autobiographical addition drama &#x3C;i&#x3E;Heaven Knows What&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. \n\nHow sales figured into Asghar Farhadi&#x27;s &#x3C;b&#x3E;(14) &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Salesman&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; isn&#x27;t so clear &#x2014; the movie, which is set in Farhadi&#x27;s native Iran, was reported early on to be tied in some way to Arthur Miller&#x2019;s famous play &#x3C;i&#x3E;Death of a Salesman&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. The Cannes description is more circumspect, noting only that it&#x27;s a movie about a couple whose relationship is changed by a move to a new apartment. But Farhadi, who won an Oscar and was nominated for another in 2012 for &#x3C;i&#x3E;A Separation&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, is one of the most consistently impressive directors working today, so who cares? The result is bound to be heartrending.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"350\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/10/2/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-29080-1462861573-2.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Desperate dads are probably a theme of every festival, but this year&#x27;s Cannes has a few notable ones. The biggest question mark is &#x3C;b&#x3E;(15) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Blood Father&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; (pictured), Mel Gibson&#x27;s first leading role in four years. The film comes from a French director, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Mesrine&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x27;s Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Richet, and features Gibson as an ex-con whose teenage daughter (Erin Moriarty) has to be saved from drug dealers. Gibson&#x27;s stock in Hollywood has been understandably low since his various meltdowns, legal troubles, substance abuse issues, and racist and anti-Semitic remarks over the last decade; this film floats the idea of him as a viable leading man again, and it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how that works out.\n\nThere&#x27;s also an ex-con &#x3C;i&#x3E;and&#x3C;/i&#x3E; another desperate dad in &#x3C;b&#x3E;(16) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Hell or High Water&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;, the new film from David Mackenzie. They&#x27;re brothers, played by Ben Foster and Chris Pine, and they plan a bank robbery to save their family&#x27;s farm. Mackenzie is a gifted director whose prison drama &#x3C;i&#x3E;Starred Up&#x3C;/i&#x3E; was a deeply tender movie about some very violence-prone men, so there&#x27;s promise to this West Texas heist scenario. \n\nJapan&#x27;s Hirokazu Kore-eda has a way with understated family dramas in which huge emotions lurk under quiet scenes, and his new film about a deadbeat dad trying to reconnect with his son, &#x3C;b&#x3E;(17) &#x3C;i&#x3E;After the Storm&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;, sounds like it&#x27;ll offer more of the same. \n\nAnd in Romanian filmmaker Cristian Mungiu&#x27;s latest, &#x3C;b&#x3E;(18) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Graduation&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;, a Transylvanian doctor has to decide if he&#x27;ll go against his own beliefs to help his daughter get an education and live abroad after an attack gets in the way of her final exams. Mungiu is capable of making thrillers out of people struggling against impassive systems (see his tremendous &#x3C;i&#x3E;4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, about a woman trying to obtain an illegal abortion), and this one certainly has that potential.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"350\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/6/20/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-11628-1462581505-1.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x3C;b&#x3E;(19) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Dog Eat Dog&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; (pictured) sounds like a straightforward crime movie: Three ex-cons botch a kidnapping job and go on the run from the Mexican mob in Los Angeles. But the film comes from Paul Schrader, writer of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Taxi Driver&#x3C;/i&#x3E; and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Raging Bull&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, director of &#x3C;i&#x3E;American Gigolo&#x3C;/i&#x3E; and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Affliction&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. He&#x27;s a great talent in need of a win, as is Nicolas Cage, who plays one member of the main trio, alongside Christopher Matthew Cook and Willem Dafoe.\n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;(20) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Risk&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; is, like &#x3C;i&#x3E;Dog Eat Dog&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, a Directors&#x27; Fortnight selection, and it&#x27;s also about being on the run, though in the case of its subject, Julian Assange, it&#x27;s extradition that&#x27;s the issue. Documentarian Laura Poitras, film&#x27;s foremost chronicler of our age of surveillance, was there with Glenn Greenwald in Edward Snowden&#x27;s Hong Kong hotel room in &#x3C;i&#x3E;Citizenfour&#x3C;/i&#x3E; before the former NSA analyst was granted asylum in Russia. Assange has himself been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for over three years now, and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Risk&#x3C;/i&#x3E; reportedly looks at the period leading up to that confinement, when WikiLeaks was responsible for major information dumps.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"350\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/10/3/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-8034-1462866679-2.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Isabelle Huppert plays a ruthless video game executive in &#x3C;b&#x3E;(21) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Elle&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; (pictured), which should be enough in itself to sell the film. But &#x3C;i&#x3E;Elle&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is also directed by Paul Verhoeven, who, after a Hollywood run that included &#x3C;i&#x3E;RoboCop&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Total Recall&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Showgirls&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, went home to the Netherlands for World War II drama &#x3C;i&#x3E;Black Book&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, starring Carice van Houten as a Jewish woman who becomes a resistance spy. In the decade since, he&#x27;s kept quiet, releasing only a small film called &#x3C;i&#x3E;Tricked&#x3C;/i&#x3E; while trying to get together a bigger project. &#x3C;i&#x3E;Elle&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is his comeback, and, given that it places Huppert in a tense game with a man who attacked her, it doesn&#x27;t seem like he&#x27;s softened up one bit.\n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;(22) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Toni Erdmann&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; is also about a dedicated exec, a jet-setting woman (Sandra H&#xFC;ller) whose relationship with her free-spirited music teacher dad (Peter Simonischek) has drifted. They seem destined to grow more distant until he calls on his alter ego, a wilder, freer version of himself that allows the two to bridge the gap. Sounds odd, maybe, but the film is written and directed by Germany&#x27;s Maren Ade, whose last film, the relationship drama &#x3C;i&#x3E;Everyone Else&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, showed an incredible talent for catching all the little ways people wound and criticize the ones they love.\n\nThe main character (Ad&#xE8;le Haenel) in &#x3C;b&#x3E;(23) &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Unknown Girl&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; isn&#x27;t an executive &#x2014; she&#x27;s a doctor who chooses to ignore a late visitor who comes to her clinic after she&#x27;s closed for the day. The next day, a dead girl is found nearby, and the doctor becomes obsessed with finding out her identity. &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Unknown Girl&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is the latest film from the Dardenne brothers, favorites of Cannes, whose work often explores people in tenuous economic positions. This sounds no different, and, coming off of the high of 2014&#x27;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Two Days, One Night&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, it&#x27;s one to really look forward to.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"350\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2016-05/6/14/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-7800-1462560480-1.jpg\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Cannes leans decidedly toward art films, but the fest always makes a place for a handpicked studio debut or two, like last year&#x27;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Mad Max: Fury Road&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. This year, Cannes is showcasing a few, most notably &#x3C;b&#x3E;(24) &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Nice Guys&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E; (pictured), the chatty &#x27;70s-set buddy-cop movie from &#x3C;i&#x3E;Lethal Weapon&#x3C;/i&#x3E; writer Shane Black, which should bring stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe to the festival&#x27;s famous red carpet and get a touch of prestige in return.\n\nThriller &#x3C;b&#x3E;(25) &#x3C;i&#x3E;Money Monster&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;, in which George Clooney goes big as a Jim Cramer-style finance show host who, with his producer (Julia Roberts), is taken hostage on air, is headed to Cannes the day before it hits theaters. The movie, which takes on themes of corporate ruthlessness and the 24-hour news cycle, is Jodie Foster&#x27;s fourth as a director. \n\nAnd Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &#x3C;b&#x3E;(26) &#x3C;i&#x3E;The BFG&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;, adapted from the novel about a big, friendly giant by Roald Dahl, will come to Cannes a big two months before its scheduled release date, with Ruby Barnhill playing
