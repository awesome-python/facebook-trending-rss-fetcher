Oklahoma City for the fourth time in six years is in the Western Conference Finals, where they will face the defending champion Warriors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/oklahoma-city-thunder\"&gt;Thunder&lt;/a&gt; will have a chance to close the series against the &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/san-antonio-spurs\"&gt;Spurs&lt;/a&gt; with a win at home in Game 6. They earned that privilege by rallying when they were looking their most vulnerable and beating San Antonio twice in a row. One more victory and they will clinch a spot in the Western Conference Finals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/35063/russell-westbrook\"&gt;Russell Westbrook&lt;/a&gt; deserves plenty of praise for Oklahoma City's turnaround. Following a terrible Game 3, he found his focus. He recommitted to distributing the ball and letting &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/24285/kevin-durant\"&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; get more shots in Game 4 before returning to his usual assertive form on Tuesday, firing 27 shots and scoring 35 points. He was huge in the fourth quarter as well, pitching in 10 points and three assists to finish off the Spurs. This might still be Durant's team but Westbrook is proving that he's readier than ever to be a leader.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The stars are not the only reason the Thunder have been outplaying the Spurs. Their role players have been terrific as well. &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/198051/steven-adams\"&gt;Steven Adams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/149905/enes-kanter\"&gt;Enes Kanter&lt;/a&gt; are taking advantage of San Antonio's lack of size inside to have their way on the boards and scoring off the pick-and-roll. &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/51539/serge-ibaka\"&gt;Serge Ibaka&lt;/a&gt; has taken on a lesser role but he's been scorching hot from beyond the arc, averaging 57 percent from outside in the series. Even the always mercurial &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/157872/dion-waiters\"&gt;Dion Waiters&lt;/a&gt; is giving them steady minutes at the wing, contributing nine points per game on 48.5 percent shooting.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Even with those advantages, though, the games have been close. The Thunder have not dominated. In fact, the Spurs had the lead going into the final quarter in the past two losses. &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/21819/lamarcus-aldridge\"&gt;LaMarcus Aldridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/132534/kawhi-leonard\"&gt;Kawhi Leonard&lt;/a&gt; have been matching the input of Westbrook and Durant, and when someone else steps up San Antonio seems like the better overall team, at least for stretches. They could easily take Game 6 and force a final showdown at home in the AT&amp;amp;T Center.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the Thunder have the edge in the series and they need to make the best of it. Use the energy from the home crowd, hurt the Spurs inside and finish this. If they give San Antonio another chance, they might regret it on Sunday in a potential Game 7.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;How to watch Thunder vs. Spurs Game 6&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Place: &lt;/b&gt;Chesapeake Energy Arena&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time: &lt;/b&gt;8:30 p.m. ET&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TV: &lt;/b&gt;ESPN&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Streaming:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://espn.go.com/watchespn/\"&gt;WatchESPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n</content>\r\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/12/11668878/nba-playoffs-schedule-results-2016-game-6-thunder-spurs-russell-westbrook-kawhi-leonard-kevin-durant\" />\r\n    <id>http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/12/11668878/nba-playoffs-schedule-results-2016-game-6-thunder-spurs-russell-westbrook-kawhi-leonard-kevin-durant</id>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Liam Boylan-Pett</name>\r\n    </author>\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <published>2016-05-12T19:59:16-04:00</published>\r\n    <updated>2016-05-12T19:59:16-04:00</updated>\r\n    <title>NHL playoffs Thursday: Sharks advance to Western Conference Final</title>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">  \r\n  &lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6kDTrnqHaIAD6J9SH-PUsICoyc=/74x0:4173x2733/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49585811/GettyImages-531107258.0.jpg\" /&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &lt;p&gt;After besting the Predators 5-0 in Game 7, the Blues await the Sharks as the final two teams in the Western Conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a decidedly quicker overtime in Game 6, the Sharks and Predators play a winner-take-all Game 7 on Thursday for the chance to advance to the Western Conference Final. Puck drop for Game 7 is 9 p.m. EST on NBCSN.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Scouting the Predators&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pekka Rinne allowed a few bad goals in Game 6, and will overall need to be better in the final game of this series. Thankfully for Nashville, his team rallied around him in the overtime victory, with some big time goals from Ryan Johanssen and Colin Wilson. The Predators pushed the pace in the series equalizer with the 32-18 shot advantage, but might not get so lucky against a Sharks team out for blood.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Scouting the Sharks&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Predators were wise not to give the Sharks many chances on the power play in Game 6, as San Jose's special teams has clicked at a 28-percent rate since the playoffs began. The Sharks took advantage of the one power play opportunity they were given in Game 6, but they managed just five shots on goal in the third period of the loss. A bigger offensive output will be needed to best the Predators in Game 7, and better puck possession will be key for the Sharks biggest stars.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Nashville Predators at&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;San Jose Sharks&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p id=\"paragraph3\" class=\"pgh-paragraph\"&gt;9 p.m. ET | Game 7, Western Conference Round 2&lt;br&gt;SAP Center | San Jose, California&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Local: &lt;/b&gt;N/A&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Nat'l: &lt;/b&gt;NBCSN, SN, TVAS2&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Live stream&lt;/b&gt; at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://stream.nbcsports.com/liveextra/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ref-index=\"9\"&gt;NBC Live Extra&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=\"new\" href=\"https://gamecentrelive.rogers.com/\" data-ref-index=\"10\"&gt;Rogers GameCentre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;More coverage: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a data-ref-index=\"11\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ontheforecheck.com/\"&gt;Predators blog&lt;/a&gt; |&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-ref-index=\"12\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fearthefin.com/\"&gt;Sharks blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n</content>\r\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/12/11668808/nhl-playoffs-thursday-sharks-predators\" />\r\n    <id>http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/12/11668808/nhl-playoffs-thursday-sharks-predators</id>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Mary Clarke</name>\r\n    </author>\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <published>2016-05-11T19:39:01-04:00</published>\r\n    <updated>2016-05-11T19:39:01-04:00</updated>\r\n    <title>NHL playoffs: Blues rout Stars in Game 7, move on to Western Conference Final</title>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">  \r\n  &lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GeE2-FjkE72QMeBvbCBDdlFpclo=/140x0:4177x2691/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49580045/usa-today-9291173.0.jpg\" /&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &lt;p&gt;A back-and-forth series that saw the road team win five of seven games, including the last four, ended with the St. Louis Blues routing the Dallas Stars 6-1 on the road in Game 7 for the right to play in the NHL Western Conference Final.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two best teams in the Western Conference will square off in Game 7 when the &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/dallas-stars\"&gt;Dallas Stars&lt;/a&gt; host the &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/st-louis-blues\"&gt;St. Louis Blues&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. Puck drop is at 8 p.m. ET on NBCSN and Sportsnet.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Scouting the Stars&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The only reason the Stars won Game 6 was poor goaltending for the Blues and career-best goaltending for Dallas. The Stars finally converted on chances early, scoring three quick goals in the first period to chase &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/54387/brian-elliott\"&gt;Brian Elliott&lt;/a&gt; from the net for the first time in the series. Other than that, Kari Lehtonen's best playoff game kept Dallas hanging on until the final buzzer. They'll have their home crowd behind them for Game 7, which should help turn the tide a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Scouting the Blues&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The key for St. Louis is to play exactly how they did for the final 40 minutes, when they had the Stars in pure survival mode. Scoring early is crucial; when the Blues have held a lead in the series the Stars have struggled to mount comebacks. Brian Elliott will likely get the start in net once again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Dallas Stars at St. Louis Blues&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=\"pgh-paragraph\" id=\"paragraph9\"&gt;8 p.m. ET | Game 7, Western Conference Round 2&lt;br&gt;American Airlines Center | Dallas, Texas&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Local: &lt;/b&gt;N/A&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Nat'l: &lt;/b&gt;NBCSN, SN, TVAS&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Live stream&lt;/b&gt; at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-ref-index=\"38\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stream.nbcsports.com/liveextra/\"&gt;NBC Live Extra&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-ref-index=\"39\" href=\"https://gamecentrelive.rogers.com/\" target=\"new\"&gt;Rogers GameCentre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;More coverage: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.defendingbigd.com/\"&gt;Stars blog&lt;/a&gt; |&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stlouisgametime.com/\"&gt;Blues blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n</content>\r\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/2016/5/11/11660880/nhl-playoffs-stanley-cup-blues-stars-game-7-western-conference\" />\r\n    <id>http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/2016/5/11/11660880/nhl-playoffs-stanley-cup-blues-stars-game-7-western-conference</id>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Eric Stephen</name>\r\n    </author>\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <published>2016-05-11T19:38:54-04:00</published>\r\n    <updated>2016-05-11T19:38:54-04:00</updated>\r\n    <title>NBA playoffs 2016: Warriors eliminate Blazers at home, Raptors beat Heat in pivotal Game 5</title>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">  \r\n  &lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CswQTvh2MomSbz23v371dGEnaoE=/0x587:2301x2121/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49577431/GettyImages-530894140.0.jpg\" /&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &lt;p&gt;Steph Curry got his MVP award, then led the Warriors over the Blazers in Game 5 to send Golden State to the Western Conference Finals. In the East, the Raptors outlasted the Heat 99-91 in Game 5 on Wednesday night, pushing Miami to the brink of elimination. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The games haven't been pretty, but they have been close. Three of the contests between the &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/miami-heat\"&gt;Heat&lt;/a&gt; and Raptors this series, including Miami's 94-87 victory Monday night, have gone to overtime. Now the series heads back to Toronto where the Raptors will look to bounce back from that tough loss.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In order to do so, they'll need more from their All-Star backcourt of &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/21730/kyle-lowry\"&gt;Kyle Lowry&lt;/a&gt; and DeMar DeRozan. Lowry, after finally rediscovering his touch in Game 3, struggled from the field once again in Game 4 and misfired on nine of his 11 looks. DeRozan was just 4-for-17. Toronto will need more from both players going forward, especially with &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/150194/jonas-valanciunas\"&gt;Jonas Valanciunas&lt;/a&gt; out for the remainder of the series with an ankle injury.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As for Miami, the Heat needed a big performance from &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/21883/dwyane-wade\"&gt;Dwyane Wade&lt;/a&gt; (30 points on 13-for-24 from the field) in order to squeeze out that Game 4 win. Erik Spoelstra's crew is also battling without its starting center. &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/111947/hassan-whiteside\"&gt;Hassan Whiteside&lt;/a&gt; left Game 3 with a sprained knee, sat out Game 4 and will also miss Game 5.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With him out of the lineup the Heat have no one to patrol the paint, deter Lowry or DeRozan or keep &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/150201/bismack-biyombo\"&gt;Bismack Biyombo&lt;/a&gt; off the glass. The question is: Will the Raptors have more success attacking the rim and will head coach &lt;a class=\"sbn-auto-link\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/98718/dwane-casey\"&gt;Dwane Casey&lt;/a&gt; feel comfortable leaving a big lineup on the floor to take advantage of Miami's lack of size?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;How to watch&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/toronto-raptors\" class=\"sbn-auto-link\"&gt;Raptors&lt;/a&gt; vs. Heat&amp;nbsp;Game 5&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Place: &lt;/b&gt;Air Canada Centre&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time: &lt;/b&gt;8 p.m. ET&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TV: &lt;/b&gt;TNT&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Streaming: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tntdrama.com/watchtnt/\"&gt;Watch TNT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: center; letter-spacing: 0.25em\"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Goran Dragic keeps getting hit in the face | 8211\" data-volume-uuid=\"a1ace202f\" data-volume-id=\"8211\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" id=\"volume-placement-3787\" class=\"volume-video\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n</content>\r\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/11/11660882/nba-playoffs-2016-schedule-results-heat-raptors-warriors-blazers\" />\r\n    <id>http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/11/11660882/nba-playoffs-2016-schedule-results-heat-raptors-warriors-blazers</id>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Eric Stephen</name>\r\n    </author>\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <published>2016-05-10T20:24:12-04:00</published>\r\n    <updated>2016-05-10T20:24:12-04:00</updated>\r\n    <title>NBA Playoffs: Thunder win Game 5 in San Antonio behind Russell Westbrook</title>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">  \r\n  &lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gk3F5NOwoXEyfXjOksdXruzpKoI=/0x0:5062x3375/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49567713/usa-today-9289370.0.jpg\" /&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &lt;p&gt;The Thunder surged back behind a magnificent overall performance by Russell Westbrook to win Game 5 in San Antonio and take a 3-2 series lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/san-antonio-spurs\" class=\"sbn-auto-link\"&gt;San Antonio Spurs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/oklahoma-city-thunder\" class=\"sbn-auto-link\"&gt;Oklahoma City Thunder&lt;/a&gt; head back to Texas for Game 5 all tied up at 2-2 after a scintillating &lt;a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/24285/kevin-durant\" class=\"sbn-auto-link\"&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; performance in Game 4 helped the Thunder pull away in crunch time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Durant tied a playoff career high with 41 points, with 17 of those coming in the final frame. He made all six of his shot attempts in the fourth quarter and also handed out two assists in a gratifying performance after the disappointing showing in a Game 3 loss that had Oklahoma City's season on the ropes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/35063/russell-westbrook\" class=\"sbn-auto-link\"&gt;Russell Westbrook&lt;/a&gt; had another brutal shooting day, but he helped make up for it with 15 assists.

They now trail in the series 2-1.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lillard was fantastic Saturday night. He was launching three-pointers off the dribble from 28 feet and breaking the Golden State down off the dribble, too.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Warriors are sure to come out strong Monday night. But once again they'll likely have to go to battle without &lt;a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/71907/stephen-curry\" class=\"sbn-auto-link\"&gt;Stephen Curry&lt;/a&gt; on the floor. Curry is expected to participate in the team's shootaround on Monday but head coach Steve Kerr told the media on Sunday that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MarcJSpearsESPN/status/729401462686547968\"&gt;it's doubtful he suits up for the game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The means the load will once again fall on &lt;a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/150213/klay-thompson\" class=\"sbn-auto-link\"&gt;Klay Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and Draymond Green. Thompson is averaging 33 points per game this series, while Green is averaging 25.7 points, 12 rebounds and 8.7 assists.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The question for the Warriors will be: can they figure out a way to slow down Lillard. If they can, then they should have no problem heading back home to Golden State up 3-1. If once again they struggle then perhaps Portland can force Curry back to the court quicker than he'd like.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;How to watch Warriors vs. &lt;a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/portland-trail-blazers\" class=\"sbn-auto-link\"&gt;Trail Blazers&lt;/a&gt; Game 4&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Place: &lt;/b&gt;Moda Center&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time: &lt;/b&gt;10:30 p.m. ET&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TV: &lt;/b&gt;TNT&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Streaming: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tntdrama.com/watchtnt/\"&gt;Watch TNT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: center; letter-spacing: 0.25em\"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Draymond Green's mom is the Warriors' 6th man&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Draymond Green's mom is the Warriors' 6th Man | 8176\" data-volume-uuid=\"71578da35\" data-volume-id=\"8176\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" id=\"volume-placement-2977\" class=\"volume-video\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be sure to &lt;a href=\"http://goo.gl/Nbabae\"&gt;subscribe to SB Nation's YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for highlight videos, features, analysis and more&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n</content>\r\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/9/11645818/nba-playoffs-2016-warriors-blazers-raptors-heat\" />\r\n    <id>http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/9/11645818/nba-playoffs-2016-warriors-blazers-raptors-heat</id>\r\n    <author>\r\n      <name>Mike Prada</name>\r\n    </author>\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <published>2016-05-08T15:42:46-04:00</published>\r\n    <updated>2016-05-08T15:42:46-04:00</updated>\r\n    <title>NBA Playoffs Sunday: Thunder rally to beat Spurs, Cavaliers sweep away Hawks</title>\r\n    <content type=\"html\">  \r\n  &lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-0pnTRkR3p2m44nPJCL844JOE8=/0x0:4245x2830/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49548939/usa-today-9287695.0.jpg\" /&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant tied a playoff career high with 41 points to lift Oklahoma City to a Game 4 win and a tied series against the Spurs.

With his cherubic face and easy athletic grace, Lue still looks the part of a point guard. But he\u2019s 39 years old now and the faint whispers of gray reveal his professional path. \"I dye mine gray,\" he joked, running his hand through his closely-cropped hair. \"My Barack Obama look.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lue has been a coach for only a few years and a head coach for barely a few months, but he\u2019s taken to the job like a lifer. There are plenty of early signs to indicate that he may become a really good one, if he\u2019s not already. Certainly the Cleveland Cavaliers have bet big on that being the case. Lue\u2019s predecessor David Blatt had taken the Cavs to Game 6 of the Finals with an injury-ravaged roster that had been revamped at the trade deadline. When Blatt was fired in late January, the Cavs were 30-11 and comfortably in first place in the Eastern Conference.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The reasons for the dismissal have been well-documented. Blatt was hired to develop a team of young talent, not one with LeBron James and immediate designs on a championship. Their relationship was tenuous from the beginning and never really evolved. Any team with LeBron on its roster will have more than its share of tension and scrutiny, and Blatt didn\u2019t help himself by being needlessly antagonistic with the press corps that covered the team. It was an unfair position for a decorated veteran coach of international competition to make his NBA debut, but this is an unfair business.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"chorus-snippet floated_images\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"float_right\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6456021/smitty.0.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Blatt\u2019s firing may have been a surprise, but Lue\u2019s promotion to the big chair was not. League observers have been talking about his coaching potential from the moment he ended his career and took his place behind the Celtics bench under Doc Rivers. Those who have worked with him previously rave about his communication skills, sharp eye and upbeat approach. As one former colleague put it, \"He isn\u2019t afraid to tell a player the truth.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lue\u2019s confident in the way that people who truly know themselves are confident. That manifests itself in a natural charisma that translates well to his players.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"He\u2019s never changed from the time he was an assistant to now in terms of his demeanor,\" Cavs GM David Griffin told me. \"The moment\u2019s never been too big for him. He\u2019s been consistent and guys respect that.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;James reinforced that notion following Cleveland\u2019s Game 1 victory over Atlanta in the conference semifinals. The Cavs had built a big lead that evaporated in the second half after Atlanta\u2019s Dennis Schroder got hot. The Cavs\u2019 scheme essentially dared Schroder to beat them from the outside and he was doing just that. Lue stayed calm, his players responded and they walked away with an 11-point win.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We have an even keel mentality starting with our head coach,\" James said after the game. \"He\u2019s the same way no matter the point in the game. When we mess up, he gets on us. He\u2019s always saying, \u2018OK let\u2019s just move on to the next possession. Let\u2019s figure out a way how we can be better on the next possession.\u2019 No matter the point or score of the game he\u2019s always the same way. It\u2019s a calm feeling when you come come to the sideline no matter if you\u2019re giving up a lead or not.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Comparisons to Blatt are inevitable and it doesn\u2019t take much to read between the lines. It\u2019s a no-win situation for Lue, who has gone out of his way to downplay that dynamic. He doesn\u2019t want to be viewed as the guy who stepped over someone, to the point where ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin reported that &lt;a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15430004/tyronn-lue-cleveland-cavaliers-sign-new-contract-taking-david-blatt-head-coach\"&gt;Lue still hasn\u2019t signed a new contract&lt;/a&gt; befitting his promotion. Still, this is the opportunity of a lifetime and he\u2019d be foolish to be someone he\u2019s not for the sake of appearances. His approach, which Lue said he learned from playing for Phil Jackson, has served him well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"When you\u2019re calm and you\u2019re not complaining, you\u2019re not rattled, that carries over to your team,\" Lue said. \"If you react to every single call, to every single shot or every single turnover it doesn\u2019t give your team confidence. I think being even-keeled, being poised, and staying with it, being positive with the guys, I think that\u2019s best approach. Playing the game myself for 11 years I\u2019ve seen how guys react to certain situations and I think it\u2019s the best way to coach.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One shouldn\u2019t confuse calmness with passivity. Lue has held LeBron accountable, both publically and privately, and those around the team say this is exactly what James wanted from his coach. If it was a test, Lue passed, but there is far more to coaching than developing relationships and setting boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div data-ad-slot=\"athena_features\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Following a period of transition and adjustment during the regular season, Lue has made several key tactical decisions during the playoffs. He elevated Tristan Thompson into the starting lineup and tightened up his rotations, deploying more smallball lineups. He also made Kevin Love a featured part of the offense by playing through him in the post. Those strategies have integrated Love more fully into the offensive flow and unlocked what appears to be staggering offensive potential.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"They\u2019re still huge. LeBron is as big as a four-man so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re losing that much size,\" Atlanta\u2019s Kyle Korver told me before Game 1. \"They obviously have a lot of shooting. It just gives Kyrie and LeBron more driving lanes. They\u2019re a great drive and kick team. They\u2019re very efficient around the basket and they\u2019re very efficient from three. When you go small it\u2019s harder to double, it\u2019s harder to help because you\u2019re worried about giving up 3-point shooting.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Korver\u2019s remarks proved prescient a few days later when the Cavs\u2019 3-point shooting devastated the Hawks in a Game 2 rout featuring an NBA-record 25 made 3-pointers. Some of those threes were a byproduct of J.R. Smith\u2019s uncanny knack for making absurd shots look normal. Many of them came from the simple tenets of ball movement, unselfish play and the confidence to knock down shots.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"We\u2019re making the right play,\" Lue said. \"When Kevin posts up and they double team we make the right pass out of the double team. Swing, swing, shot.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Cavs\u2019 are getting 60 percent of their makes off assists, an uptick from the regular season, and their turnovers are way down. Those are positive signs of trust and belief in one another.  As Lue put it, \"If they\u2019re open, the guy that\u2019s open knows he\u2019s going to get the basketball. It\u2019s fun to play that way.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fun isn\u2019t a word that hasn\u2019t been thrown around all that much with the Cavs since LeBron came back. Tense is more like it. Edgy is another. But here they were on Wednesday night in Cleveland, knocking down shot after shot and having the time of their lives. They were having so much fun destroying the Hawks that a couple of Atlanta players, notably Paul Millsap, said they were bothered by their pursuit of the 3-point record. (Lue had his starters on the bench during the fourth quarter and noted in his postgame remarks that he didn\u2019t care for the way the reserves were hunting shots.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"chorus-snippet browser_wide_media\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6456023/cavs.0.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;As Cav controversies go, this one merits barely any attention. There always has to be something and if blowing out their opponents is their biggest problem, then there really isn\u2019t any problem at all. The bottom line is they made a very good Atlanta team look downright ordinary and if that bothers the Hawks, perhaps they shouldn\u2019t have been two steps behind the action all night.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"I think we\u2019re playing with appropriate fear,\" Griffin told me between Games 1 and 2. \"I think we\u2019re playing like we\u2019re focused. Guys are just focused and playing together and for each other, which is good.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fear is another word rarely featured in the Cavs\u2019 lexicon, but playing with appropriate fear is an apt phrase for this team. They have achieved so much, so fast, but in their world they haven\u2019t really achieved anything at all. Everything they\u2019ve accomplished has been expected. That\u2019s the burden and the blessing of employing LeBron James. Those accomplishments weren\u2019t enough to save Blatt\u2019s job and they haven\u2019t been enough to satisfy the city\u2019s thirst for a championship. There\u2019s a lot riding on this postseason, but the Cavs seem more focused on the tasks at hand.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"There\u2019s no reason to look ahead,\" LeBron said pointedly after the Game 2 romp when asked if they were sending a message to the rest of the league. \"Tomorrow\u2019s not promised. For our team we\u2019re still a young group. Let\u2019s not get this mistaken. We\u2019re still a young group. We just got put together last year and then put together again toward the All-Star break. We don\u2019t have enough games played in pressure situations for us to ever lose focus on what the main thing is and that\u2019s to play the next game. We can\u2019t afford it. We don\u2019t have the experience of San Antonio and Golden State and OKC. We don\u2019t have that. So we have to understand to be in the moment.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The moment came again in Game 3 on Friday when the Hawks built a nine-point lead in the fourth quarter. Lue called on Channing Frye to put another shooter on the floor to beat Atlanta\u2019s traps and Frye went for 27 points. It was Cleveland\u2019s version of the Lineup of Death and it was overwhelming. The moment for Tyronn Lue as a head coach is here, and he\u2019s rewarding the faith the Cavs showed in him.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div style=\"background-image:url('http://assets.sbnation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/features/sunday-shootaround/section-3.jpg')\" class=\"big-section\" id=\"tl\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"lede-box right\"&gt;\r\n&lt;i class=\"icon-doc\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;The List&lt;span&gt;Consumable NBA thoughts&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"main-wrap\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant\u2019s free agency will be the story of the summer, while DeMar DeRozan and Al Horford will also make huge scores. Beyond them, there are a number of players still active in the postseason who will define a market without established boundaries. They may not all be max players, but their deals will help establish some kind of parameters for what will be a chaotic offseason.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kent Bazemore:&lt;/b&gt; The latest graduate of Hawks University, Bazemore has emerged as a fearless competitor with an improved 3-point shooting stroke. Given a larger role with the offseason departure of DeMarre Carroll, Bazemore acquitted himself well as a starter. He doesn\u2019t Baze less -- as if that wasn\u2019t even possible -- but his energetic style has been tempered by a better understanding of situations. It\u2019s that relentless approach that got him into the league in the first place, and he has proven during the playoffs that he is unafraid of the moment. Bazemore will get a huge deal and casual observers will freak out, but he\u2019s earned this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hassan Whiteside:&lt;/b&gt; The great conundrum of the regular season will be the most debated free agent on the market. Rough edges and all, Whiteside is a legitimately terrifying force in the middle. It\u2019s hard to argue with his production and it\u2019s even harder to knock his effort, given that he played through a variety of injuries before injuring his knee in Saturday's Game 3. Even with all that, the question isn\u2019t whether he\u2019ll get paid, but who will be the one shelling out the dough.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bismack Biyombo:&lt;/b&gt; Rim-protecting centers were all the rage a few years ago, but they have begun to lose their luster with the transition toward smaller lineups and positional versatility. Here\u2019s the thing, though: You don\u2019t need one until you don\u2019t have one. Biyombo\u2019s offensive limitations are obvious, especially in the postseason, but he\u2019s still a legit shot-blocker and rugged rebounder. The Raptors don\u2019t have his full Bird Rights, meaning another team can grab him for the right offer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allen Crabbe:&lt;/b&gt; A F+Z favorite throughout the year, Crabbe is a 3+D wing whose 3-point shooting is ahead of his defensive presence. Shooting is the skill that teams lust over and a 24-year-old wing who makes almost 40 percent of his long-range shots will always find a market for his services. Crabbe is a restricted free agent and the Blazers would do very well to lock him up as part of their core.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Festus Ezeli:&lt;/b&gt; There has been a lot of attention paid to Harrison Barnes\u2019 pending free agency and rightly so, for it has a ripple effect on the Warriors\u2019 offseason plans (read: KD). Barnes is going to make big money and there will be teams lining up to secure his services. Ezeli, however, is also set to become a free agent and that will present another interesting pivot point for the franchise. He\u2019s been groomed as Andrew Bogut\u2019s successor and as Draymond Green testified the center is set to make, \"Big money. Big money.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n \r\n&lt;div style=\"background-image:url('http://assets.sbnation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/features/sunday-shootaround/section-4.jpg')\" class=\"big-section\" id=\"icymi\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"lede-box\"&gt;\r\n&lt;i class=\"icon-fire\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;ICYMI&lt;span&gt;or In Case You Missed It&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"main-wrap\"&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=\"story\"&gt;&lt;a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/5/5/11593556/kobe-from-downtown%0D%0A\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6456027/kobe-wall.0.jpg\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"text\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;From Downtown&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fascinating deep dive into Kobe Bryant\u2019s Angeleno legacy from Tyler Tynes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n \r\n&lt;div class=\"story\"&gt;&lt;a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/5/5/11598498/pacers-larry-bird-ice-cold-frank-vogel\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6456029/bird.0.jpg\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"text\"&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Ice cold&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Larry Bird\u2019s firing of Frank Vogel was merciless, writes Seth Rosenthal.

It began when George resisted the move to the four, preferring to stay at his natural wing position. It was there when Vogel was alternating between the smallball lineups that Bird preferred and the traditional two-big alignment that proved more successful. Vogel wrung 45 wins and a 7-game series out of this roster that even Bird acknowledged wasn\u2019t good enough. Bird may be right about changing the voice, but Vogel has proven to be a capable coach who achieved strong results with whatever he was given. Good luck finding someone better.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n \r\n&lt;div class=\"quote-wrap\"&gt;\r\n&lt;q&gt;\"The decision was not about Dave\u2019s in-game coaching.
