Meizu says it works to distinguish which part of Android is good and what needs work and brings only important elements to its Flyme UI.</p>\n<p>She said they are working hard to deliver the latest security patch received from <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> at the earliest, as \u201csecurity is a key to the success of Flyme UI and the reason behind its 20 million customers\u201d.</p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/meizu-m3-note-759.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2798369\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/meizu-m3-note-759.jpg\" alt=\"Meizu, Meizu m3 note, Meizu m3 note first impressions, Meizu m3 note specs, Meizu m3 note price, Meizu m3 note features, Android, smartphones, Android Marshmallow update, tech news, technology\" /></a> Meizu m3 note is the first direct competitor to <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/xiaomi/\">Xiaomi</a>\u2019s Redmi Note 3 smartphone with competitive specs on paper\n<p>The Meizu m3 note is the first direct competitor to Xiaomi\u2019s Redmi Note 3 smartphone with competitive specs on paper, including a large 4100mAh battery. Meizu, however, sees the phone as much more than competition. In fact, Leon Zhang, Marketing Head of Meizu India, goes to the extent of calling it \u201cthe beauty of attraction\u201d.</p>\n<p>The Meizu m3 note features a metal unibody design and specs to match the likes of Xiaomi\u2019s Redmi Note 3 or other similar smartphones. The differentiator is not the design but what runs on the device, the company says, putting the focus on its Flyme UI 5.1 which run on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop.</p>\n<p>But custom ROMs have for long had one simple problem, that of being pretty late to the part when it comes to Android updates. Within a few days, Google will announce Android N at its annual developer conference I/O 2016 in San Francisco. And that will leave Meizu\u2019s so called &#8216;beauty of attraction\u2019 running a two-year-old operating system.</p>\n<p>But the company doesn\u2019t think it is a valid evaluation. \u201cWe believe the key with software is interaction and integration and our Flyme UI 5 brings seamless UI and neat software elements to make an otherwise old OS feel updated,\u201d said Leon.</p>\n<p>With Flyme UI 5, Meizu has added card style multi-window option and Jennifer was quick to note that it is a fully functional multi-tasking feature. The new gallery app on Meizu\u2019s Flyme UI sorts pictures based on time and place. The picture gallery can also be viewed based on maps, very much like Google Photos app.</p>\n<p>Meizu claims significant performance improvement on Flyme UI 5 versus Flyme 4.5 and has reduced memory consumed by system apps in favour of more user apps. Like other Android ROMs, Flyme UI also boasts of 1000+ themes and 10,000+ wallpapers.</p>\n<p>Flyme UI does bring elements from Google\u2019s vanilla Android, but it lacks some of the core Android 6.0 Marshmallow features. Users won\u2019t get Google Now on Tap and there is no doze. Meizu says m3 note comes with a significantly large 4,100mAh battery but we would have liked to see Google\u2019s Doze battery optimisation here.<br />\nMeizu m3 note does sound like a good option, but the Android 6.0 release for India is definitely not on cards.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2798331&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/meizu-m3-note-flyme-ui-android-marshmallow-update-2798331/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/meizu-m3-note-flyme-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/meizu-m3-note-flyme-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Meizu-m3-note-flyme-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/meizu-m3-note-flyme.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Meizu m3 note won\u2019t be pushing the Android Marshmallow update on the phone anytime soon</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/meizu-m3-note-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Meizu, Meizu m3 note, Meizu m3 note first impressions, Meizu m3 note specs, Meizu m3 note price, Meizu m3 note features, Android, smartphones, Android Marshmallow update, tech news, technology</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Solar plane on global trip completes Arizona-to-Oklahoma leg</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/solar-plane-on-global-trip-completes-arizona-to-oklahoma-leg-2798227/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/solar-plane-on-global-trip-completes-arizona-to-oklahoma-leg-2798227/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 11:19:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 11:19:59 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2798227</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[After Oklahoma, the plane is expected to make at least one more stop in the United States before crossing the Atlantic Ocean to Europe or northern Africa, according to the website documenting the journey.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2798227&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2781843 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/solar-plane_kuma-3-759.jpg\" alt=\"Solar Plane, solar-powered airplane, Solar Plane Oklahoma, Arizona, Boeing 747, solar cells, technology news\" /> The globe-circling voyage began in March 2015 from Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, and made stops in Oman, Myanmar, China and Japan.\n<p>A solar-powered airplane has landed in Oklahoma after taking off from Arizona on the latest leg of its around-the-world journey.</p>\n<p>The Swiss-made Solar Impulse 2 took off from Phoenix Goodyear Airport about 3 am Thursday.

Gizmodo did not name this person.</p>\n<p>Facebook denied the claims, but the GOP-led US Senate Commerce Committee has sent a letter to Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg requesting answers about the matter.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a look at what the fuss is about:</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT ARE &#8216;TRENDING&#8217; TOPICS?</strong></p>\n<p>Facebook shows popular topics being discussed at any given moment.</p>\n<p>As with a similar feature on Twitter, Facebook doesn&#8217;t purport to show all the most popular topics. They wouldn&#8217;t be interesting anyway and would probably include the weather, cute puppy videos, and years-old listicles about the best ways to stay thin. Facebook says software formulas identify trending topics, and humans review them &#8220;to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Also Read:\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/facebook-conducting-full-investigation-into-trending-news-bias-reports-mark-zuckerberg/\">Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook conducting full investigation into Trending news bias\u00a0reports</a></strong></p>\n<p>Topics that appear as trending can have a self-fulfilling effect, as more Facebook readers see and share the items, and other news organizations decide to write their own stories.</p>\n<p><strong>FINDING THE TRENDS</strong></p>\n<p>On browsers, the topics appear on the top right corner, separate from the news feed containing updates from your friends and family.</p>\n<p>Besides &#8220;top trends,&#8221; users on traditional personal computers can click on specific topics such as &#8220;sports&#8221; and &#8220;entertainment.&#8221; On Wednesday, top politics trends for one U.S. user included comments from &#8220;Duck Dynasty&#8221; star Phil Robertson on the transgender bathroom issue as well as the Facebook trending controversy itself. Topics for another US Facebook user were slightly different and also had Donald Trump and &#8220;Full Frontal&#8221; comedy host Samantha Bee giving a goodbye tribute to Ted Cruz.</p>\n<p>On mobile devices, users can tap on the search bar to see the top trends, but they can&#8217;t see separate categories, regardless of whether it&#8217;s on an app or Web browser.</p>\n<p><strong>WHERE&#8217;S THE PROOF?</strong></p>\n<p>There isn&#8217;t much proof beyond one anonymous former contractor that Facebook is hiding these conservative trends.</p>\n<p>The Associated Press couldn&#8217;t independently verify the claims. Facebook&#8217;s vice president of search, Tom Stocky, said Monday that the company found &#8220;no evidence&#8221; that the allegations are true.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so. Our guidelines do permit reviewers to take steps to make topics more coherent &#8230; to deliver a more integrated experience,&#8221; Stocky wrote.</p>\n<p>As one example, he cited combining related topics into a single event, such as &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; and a movie reference widely used on May 4, &#8220;May The Fourth Be With You.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It might not even be in Facebook&#8217;s interest to promote or suppress certain perspectives. The service is used by 1.65 billion people each month, most of them outside the US Facebook has an interest in keeping these people happy, regardless of their political leanings, so that they keep using the service and advertisers keep courting them. Zuckerberg typically sets his sights on the next decade \u2014 and decades \u2014 into Facebook&#8217;s future. As such, an election year such as this one is but a blip.</p>\n<p><strong>BACKLASH FOR FACEBOOK?</strong></p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s sheers size and ubiquity means any controversy can attract the attention of the news media, politicians and political activists. Other recent examples include the company&#8217;s frequent changes to its privacy policies and its requirement that drag queens and other transgender users use their real names on the site.</p>\n<p>The latest firestorm has led to plenty of media coverage, as well as a letter from US Sen. John Thune, the South Dakota Republican who heads the Commerce Committee. He requested information on who at the company made the decisions on stories that appear in the trending feature. He asked for answers by May 24.</p>\n<p><strong>A BIG DEAL?</strong></p>\n<p>If evidence emerges that Facebook favors certain political perspectives, it would be a big deal, as it could cause people to lose trust in the company as a neutral platform.</p>\n<p>Thirty percent of US adults get news on Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. The firestorm suggests a certain degree of anxiety about the influence Facebook is having in shaping the worldview of its users by becoming their main news source, even as newspapers across the US are shutting down amid low readership and declining advertising dollars.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2798159&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/facebook-trending-topics-controversy-2798159/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/facebook-trending-articles-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/facebook-trending-articles-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Facebook-Trending-articles-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/facebook-trending-articles-big.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Facebook&#039;s trending topics shows popular topics being discussed at any given moment (Source: Facebook)</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Hyperloop One sled speeds through US desert via electromagnets</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/hyperloop-one-magnetic-levitation-pods-magnetic-levitation-2798113/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/hyperloop-one-magnetic-levitation-pods-magnetic-levitation-2798113/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 10:18:03 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 10:19:19 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2798113</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Hyperloop One is a vision to send pods holding passengers and cargo inside giant vacuum tubes between Los Angeles and San Francisco<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2798113&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/hyperloop-main.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2798132\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/hyperloop-main.jpeg\" alt=\"Hyperloop One is a vision to send pods holding passengers and cargo inside giant vacuum tubes between Los Angeles and San Francisco\" /></a> Hyperloop One is a vision to send pods holding passengers and cargo inside giant vacuum tubes between Los Angeles and San Francisco\n<p>A car-sized sled powered by electromagnets rocketed to more than 100 miles (160 kph) an hour through the Nevada desert on Wednesday in what the Los Angeles company developing the technology said was the first successful test of a futurist transit system called hyperloop.</p>\n<p>Hyperloop One is among several companies competing to bring to life a technical vision by Elon Musk, the founder of rocket maker SpaceX and electric car company Tesla Motors, who suggested sending pods holding passengers and cargo inside giant vacuum tubes between Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a matter of debate how soon &#8211;

he said to a crowd of 300. &#8220;You never know on a given day if things are going to work exactly like you want.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The sled began on a train track and then was rocketed to 105 miles per hour by electromagnets as electricity was shot into copper coils. After a short ride, the sled ran into a sand trap, sending out silicon sprays. If all goes according to plan, sleds will levitate and carry pods in a test later this year. Gigantic tubes already are scattered around the Las Vegas area test site.</p>\n<p>Company Chief Executive Rob Lloyd on Wednesday forecast a hyperloop would transport cargo by 2019 and passengers by 2021.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re practicing large, fast construction that includes robotic welding. Techniques that allow us to create a perfect production level,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What people think takes years should take quarters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Musk created a stir by saying California could build a hyperloop from San Francisco to Los Angeles for around $6 billion, a 10th of the cost of the state&#8217;s high-speed rail project.</p>\n<p>Skeptics say real-world challenges ranging from construction permits to making the new technology work mean the costs are likely to be far greater.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The hyperloop might be promising, but it&#8217;s still unproven and just an idea. High-speed rail is a proven technology that&#8217;s been in use around the world for decades,&#8221; said Lisa Marie Alley, a spokeswoman with the California High Speed Rail Authority.</p>\n<p>A hyperloop, she said, will run into the same challenges of any other large infrastructure project, including funding, right of way, environmental permits, approvals and clearances. &#8220;None of it is easy,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Alon Levy, a mathematician who writes about mass transit for the blog Pedestrian Observations, said the cost estimates from hyperloop backers do not fully take into account difficulties such as engineering turns at jet speed or even digging tunnels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do think Hyperloop can be built.

Health info fed to apps is analysed to give guidance to the patient and to send data to doctors.\n<p>A university professor experiences mild discomfort in his chest while taking a class, he chooses to ignore it. Shortly after, he receives a call from his caregiver requesting him to take some tests to make sure he\u2019s well. Spooky or not, real time health sensing and recording is projected to be a $234-billion market by 2020, according to online statistics portal Statista.</p>\n<p>Technology giants like Apple, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a> are investing substantially in this space, and hundreds of startups are in tow. For good reasons, the early adopters of digital health tools are parents with young children, people with medical conditions and young adults under the age of 35. Although still in its nascent stage, this draw seems to stem from a mix of convenience, customisation, connectivity, low cost or simply the desire to own a cool gadget.</p>\n<p>Digital health is the convergence of healthcare and technology to enable efficient and seamless healthcare management. In this domain, personal health tools (eg. wearables) are most popular, followed by care coordinators and telemedicine platforms.</p>\n<p>Wearables range from ear or hand devices that measure physical parameters (eg. blood pressure, pulse, blood oxygen, muscle exertion) by Sensogram Technologies and FitBit; to sweat biosensors on smartwatch that measure biochemical parameters (eg. body electrolytes, hydration levels) by Electrozyme.</p>\n<p><b><div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/digital-health-wearables-health-apps-smartwatch-health-apps-2797787/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/heres-why-you-should-stop-treating-google-as-your-doctor/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/google-thumb.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Here&#039;s why you should stop treating Google as your doctor</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/digital-india-scheme-to-focus-on-health-sector-arvind-gupta/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/digital-india-arvind-gupta480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Digital India scheme to focus on health sector: Arvind Gupta</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/delhi-govt-plans-for-a-paperless-citizen-service/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/sm.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Delhi govt plans for a &#039;paperless&#039; citizen service</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/in-5-years-420-patients-have-disappeared-from-state-run-ihbas/\"><span class=\"text\">In 5 years, 420 patients have \u2018disappeared\u2019 from state-run IHBAS</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/internet-may-help-predict-disease-outbreak/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/internetthumbbb.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Internet may help predict disease outbreak</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/mayor-behl-launches-unique-health-smart-card-scheme-in-pimpri/\"><span class=\"text\">Mayor Behl launches unique health smart card scheme in Pimpri</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</b></p>\n<p>Bright light intake by the body has been linked to essential components of mental wellness such as hormones, energy levels, mood, digestion and sleep. Biosensors track this intake and alert in case of deficiency or overexposure (GoodLux and SunSprite). Ingestible sensors, on the other hand, are microscopic robots which transmit intake of medicine by the patient. This form of digital medicine, like the one developed by Proteus, aims to ensure drug compliance among patients with mental illnesses, like schizophrenia. While there are thousands of health apps on Google Play and iTunes to sync with these devices, soon your iPhone case might also double up as ECG during an evening walk, like the FDA approved AliveCor, for people with type II diabetes, or your urine analysed for biomarkers.</p>\n<p>In today\u2019s cloud network, data is wealth. Big data collected by direct investigations, voluntary medical data donations or in partnership with genomic service providers like 23andMe, is being utilised for building umpteen predictive and preventive algorithms which in turn power biosensors or enable e-clinical trials for drug discovery and development. In such a study by Intel, 300 data points were collected per second over six months to record tremors, sleep quality and slowness of movement to predict, treat and hopefully, prevent Parkinson\u2019s disease. In another case, data on eye movements was recorded by Neurotrack to predict early onset of Alzheimer\u2019s. Data collected may also be used to study health trends and for designing interventional programmes.</p>\n<p>In healthcare, according to Accenture, Internet of Things (IoT) is giving way to Internet of Me (IoM) for better patient experience. Health information fed manually or electronically to \u2018Mobile Prescription Therapy\u2019 apps, like Well Doc\u2019s BlueStar, is analysed to give guidance to the patient and send the summarised data to their physician to enable tracking of progress and review prior to their visit. This optimises time and treatment efficiencies.</p>\n<p>Telemedicine platforms and digital clinics are extending diagnosis and treatment inside homes via video games for cognitive and motor skill evaluations. This interface also maintains electronic medical record (EMRs) which, unlike in hospital care, can be managed and shared between platforms and medical specialties for a comprehensive health evaluation without you ever leaving home! Maintenance of personal e-files also becomes easier as opposed to physical files and folders.</p>\n<p>Healthcare system in India is under tremendous pressure due to high patient volumes making it largely inaccessible or unaffordable. Recent times have witnessed startups providing concierge medical services to narrow this gap between providers and end-users by linking information and connections with doctors, pharmacies, medical device suppliers, diagnostic labs, paramedics etc. They are also sharing records among them for a comprehensive and productive patient experience. According to Department of Industrial Policy &amp; Promotion, FDI worth nearly $3.2 billion was received by hospitals and diagnostic labs in India in 2015.</p>\n<p>India Brand Equity Foundation projects Indian healthcare market to touch $280 billion by 2020 clocking a growth rate of 22.9 per cent. Startups like Practo, Portea Medical, MedGenome, and Lybrate are already dominating the online market and many more are following suit. With currently 930 million cellphone users, 360 million internet users, and half a billion new smartphone users projected in the next five years, India is poised to be a lucrative market for mobile-based apps, sensors and services, especially in healthcare. Soon the doctor may, quite literally, be just a click away.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797787&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/digital-health-wearables-health-apps-smartwatch-health-apps-2797787/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/health-tech-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/health-tech-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">health-tech-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b79f669bb80e3de68460b2235b5e7285?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">maneeshkarki</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/health-tech.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Digital health, wearables, health sector, health apps, smartwatch health apps, Apple, Google, Microsoft, smartwatch, health sector digital india, tech news, technology</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Myntra\u2019s U-Turn: e-commerce back to the basics</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/myntra-relaunch-desktop-website-e-commerce-2797784/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/myntra-relaunch-desktop-website-e-commerce-2797784/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 02:41:45 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 09:54:44 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ranaditya Baruah]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2797784</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Apps might be the best way for a personalised shopping experience, but in a buying behaviour driven market an app-only strategy could leave players with a narrower sales-funnel, say experts.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797784&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2797806\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/ecommerce1.jpg\" alt=\"According to a report by IAMAI, mobile internet users in India are expected to reach 371 million by June.

Despite the fast rising traffic not much is translating into sales. The report says only 13% of urban users opt for online shopping. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)\n<p>In May last year, e-tailing firm Myntra had announced that it was winding up its website and moving all its operations to its mobile app. Twelve months down the line, the Flipkart-owned company has decided to end its app-only experiment and relaunch its desktop website operations from June 1. The move has potential ramifications for the country\u2019s nascent e-commerce sector, especially since this experiment was being closely monitored by peers as a validation of whether the app-only strategy heralds the future for a sector where a majority of consumer transactions were happening over the mobile phone.</p>\n<p>Thanks to high traffic on mobile, app-only model was considered the future, something that Myntra had cited as a reason for the switch in May last year. Myntra had justified the move by saying that over 70 per cent of their traffic is driven by smartphones and mobile users and that having an app-only model would help them in providing personalised shopping experiences to its users. Despite continued high-mobile traffic, what made the e-tailing major to rollback its decision in less than a year?</p>\n<p>\u201cThe customer journeys in recent years have been evolving to take advantage of new technologies. While mobile apps are at the nucleus of overall customer experience, significant traffic to leading e-commerce websites is still driven by desktop browsers. In a market driven by consumers\u2019 buying behaviour, app-only strategy is likely to impact e-commerce organisations by having a narrower sales-funnel to start with. It is generally not an \u2018either or\u2019 decision,\u201d said Ashvin Vellody, partner, e- commerce &amp; startups, KPMG.</p>\n<p><b><div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/myntra-relaunch-desktop-website-e-commerce-2797784/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/e-commerce-trends-mobile-the-king-but-dont-shun-pcs-just-yet/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/e-shop-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">E-commerce trends: Mobile the king, but don\u2019t shun PCs just yet</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/flipkart-claims-to-be-on-top-of-mobile-traffic-ahead-of-amazon-and-snapdeal/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/ecomm_app_s1.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Flipkart claims to be on top of mobile traffic, ahead of Amazon and Snapdeal</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/2015-when-ecommerce-grew-despite-the-bumpy-ride/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/ecomm_app_s1.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">2015: When ecommerce grew, despite the bumpy ride</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/myntra-ditches-app-only-mode-as-mobile-site-goes-live-heres-what-it-means/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/myntra_feat.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">App-only not working?

Myntra also claimed that opening its desktop website will increase sales by 15-20 per cent this fiscal and bring back the customers it had lost by switching to the app-only strategy.</p>\n<p>A formal query send to parent firm Flipkart seeking details about Myntra\u2019s change in strategy did not elicit a response.</p>\n<p>According to a report by Internet and Mobile Association of India, the number of mobile Internet users in India is expected to reach 371 million by June this year. Mobile Internet user base in the country has increased from 238 million in June last year to 306 million at the end of December 2015. Despite the fast rising traffic not much is translating into sales. The report found that only 13 per cent of users in urban India are opting for online shopping. In rural India, just 1 per cent are shopping online.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving to download an app for shopping is not acceptable to many transactional users. Transactional and/or first time users contribute to a large portion of e-commerce market in India. While it is relatively easy to have a mobile app, it requires deliberate and comprehensive strategy and an execution model to build and sustain a mobile app-only ecosystem. No company can deliver extraordinary customer experience without having a mobile app in today\u2019s world. However, \u2018forcing\u2019 users to stick to a channel might not work in favour of companies,\u201d said Vellody.</p>\n<p>Experts still feel that apps are the best way to deliver a personalised shopping experience to the user. With a tailored approach, firms are more likely to put a lock on customers and build a long-term user base. Moreover, maintaining an app is likely to be cheaper than a full-fledged website. \u201cThe biggest advantage of moving to app-only model is to be able to do targeted marketing without worrying about competition. The apps are great when it comes to sending personalised notifications and keeping customers engaged,\u201d an analyst tracking the sector said.</p>\n<p>However, users in India are used to comparing products across various outlets and then arriving at a buying decision. The small screen size of smartphones is another hurdle. The bigger screen size of laptops and desktops are seen as better alternative to compare products. Keeping multiple tabs open for comparison is another convenience that the mobile doesn\u2019t allow. \u201cOur data shows that there are still many customers who use desktops to shop online. We do not want to force our customers to use one specific medium to shop,\u201d Anand Chandrasekaran, chief product officer at Snapdeal.</p>\n<p>Instead of an app-only approach, a website that functions smoothly across all devices is something all e-commerce players must focus on. \u201cDesktop browsers collect a lot of information about customers, having presence only on mobile apps limits browsers from collecting and sharing such data points,\u201d said Vellody.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> is another factor that the app-only model doesn\u2019t take into account. A lot of shopping decisions are made via Google. People are so used to looking up products on the search engine that the success of any e-commerce firm depends a lot on how prominently they are reflected on a Google search. \u201cA big disadvantage of having just an app is that you lose out on the huge traffic from Google,\u201d said a person associated with a major e-commerce firm.</p>\n<p>Unlike food ordering apps or e-hailing apps, e-commerce is not a service that people use on a daily basis. As a result, these are more prone to uninstalls. It makes more sense for an e-commerce firm to keep all channels open for a customer to make contact. \u201cToday all our development and innovation is app first, and it will continue to be our flagship experience. However, as a customer-obsessed company we will enable our customers to shop anytime, anywhere and anyway they want including the app, mobile and a desktop site,\u201d an Amazon India spokesperson said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2797784&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/myntra-relaunch-desktop-website-e-commerce-2797784/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/myntra_feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/myntra_feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Myntra_FEAT</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b79f669bb80e3de68460b2235b5e7285?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">maneeshkarki</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ecommerce1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">According to a report by IAMAI, mobile internet users in India are expected to reach 371 million by June.

I used it for well over a year and was very happy for one main reason: this was a great watch at the end of the day. And it is this simple logic that drives Pebble, which gave the world the first really smartwatch, even today.</p>\n<p><strong>Pebble Time Steel</strong></p>\n<p>The Classic Pebble was simple plastic watch that drew no one\u2019s attention, but still gave you the advantage of some smart numbers and notifications on your wrist. The newer Pebbles add more features, but without overwhelming the user with apps or data. And the Pebble Time Steel is the top of the range watch from the company.</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Rs 15,999</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9vceSI1dN8&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><strong>Watch: Pebble Time Steel Video Review</strong></a></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9vceSI1dN8&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p><strong>What is good?</strong></p>\n<p>A Pebble just works, it is more like a watch in that aspect. So the battery life even on its top end version is at least seven days. And that is despite the colour display and fitness tracking. So the times when you wear a Pebble and realise it has no juice will be few and far between.</p>\n<p>The UI is as simple as it can get on something that has smart in its names. There are four buttons and you can use these to control everything on the watch. For the rest, you have the Pebble app on the phone with access to controls, more apps and watchfaces. And, yes, the animations are fun.</p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/13214730_10154263163027664_902338119_o.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2797228\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/13214730_10154263163027664_902338119_o.jpg\" alt=\"Pebble's UI is as simple as it can get on something that has smart in its names\" /></a> Pebble&#8217;s UI is as simple as it can get on something that has smart in its names\n<p>There are some good additions with this model. For one there is fitness and sleep tracking, which is integrated natively to the smartphone through the Apple Health and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> Fit apps. So you get all types of data based on the hardware capabilities. The data does not sync on the Apple Activity app, but details do show up on the Health app. On the watch you can keep track of steps, though it does not show up as distance. There is sleep tracking too, but I was not all the comfortable wearing a smartwatch to bed. I did test though and it does work, showing very clearly that I should be sleeping more.</p>\n<p>Another interesting new app is Voice Notes. There is a small microphone on this watch that lets you dictate notes which the app notes down. The app is very accurate and you can use these to set reminders. You can also use many other third party apps that sync the phone too &#8212; I personally have loved using Endomondo on the Pebble.</p>\n<p><strong>What is not so good?</strong></p>\n<p>I am not a big fan of the Comic Sans type font the UI has. I would have loved for there to be a settings tweak to let me use other fonts and styles. If there is a way, I could not find it.</p>\n<p>The UI is very simple, maybe a bit too simple. On the homescreen, the up down buttons can be used only to scroll through your calendar, while you have to use the middle button to enter the apps. I would have loved a quicker way to access my favourite apps.</p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/13214885_10154263163572664_1239954915_o.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2797229\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/13214885_10154263163572664_1239954915_o.jpg\" alt=\"I am not a big fan of the Comic Sans type font the UI has. Pebble should add settings tweak to let me use other fonts and styles\" /></a> I am not a big fan of the Comic Sans type font the UI has. Pebble should add settings tweak to let me use other fonts and styles\n<p>It is time wearable makers put their minds together on creating a standard for chargers. The Pebble just adds another charger to my long list of these cables.</p>\n<p>The gold and red colour review unit, was not something I want to show off on my wrist. So be careful about the colour combinations you choose.</p>\n<p><strong>Should you buy</strong></p>\n<p>The Pebble Time Steel is one of the best smartwatches you can buy, even if it is not the smartest.

And on Wednesday it made what could be one of the most significant steps in ensuring it gets there. It partnered with iBall and Intel to launch the CompBook Excelance, which at Rs 9,999 might be the cheapest Windows 10 laptop.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis partnership is a reflection of our mission of empowering every individual and organisation to achieve more. Windows 10 already powers over 300 million devices globally,\u201d said Priyadarshi Mohapatra, Country General Manager, Consumer Channel Group Microsoft India.</p>\n<p>iBall CEO Sandeep Parasrampuria said the laptop penetration in India is only 9 per cent, as compared to China where its 50 per cent and thus Excelance was launched with the idea of making a laptop available in every household. He believes despite the growth of smartphone segment, laptops are the real thing. \u201cThere can be supplementary devices, but when it comes to real utility; perhaps even today, what we can do on a laptop is much higher than what one can achieve using a smartphone.\u201d</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2796629 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/iball-excelance-d.jpg\" alt=\"iBall, Windows 10, Microsoft, cheap laptop, cheapest laptop, iBall Excelance, iBall excelance price, iball excelance specs, iball excelance features, iBall Windows laptop, gadgets, technology, technology news\" /> Microsoft has a clear target: Windows 10 on over 1 billion devices in the next three years.\n<p>\u201cAs far as usage, productivity and compatibility goes; a Windows device is the most useful. Whether you want it for learning or for business, Windows is almost like a de-facto standard. Also, we wanted to present this as an affordable solution to consumers, thus a sub 10k laptop\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>iBall also launched the CompBook Exemplaire, priced slightly higher at Rs 13,999. While the laptops come with the Windows Home version pre-installed in them, users can upgrade to Windows Pro at Rs 19,999 and Rs 23,499 for Excelance and Exemplaire respectively.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2796627 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/iball-excelance-a.jpg\" alt=\"iBall, Windows 10, Microsoft, cheap laptop, cheapest laptop, iBall Excelance, iBall excelance price, iball excelance specs, iball excelance features, iBall Windows laptop, gadgets, technology, technology news\" /> iBall also launched the CompBook Exemplaire, priced slightly higher at Rs 13,999.\n<p>\u201cThe Digital India revolution prompted us as we thought there is going to be a huge consumption of information, so we started working at the right price-point at which people can consume it.

Google CEO <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/sundar-pichai/\">Sundar Pichai</a> had announced the feature when he had visited India in December 2015.</p>\n<p>Google announced a number of updates for Tap to Translate including improved Offline Mode and a Word Lens in Chinese.</p>\n<p>Google, in a <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2016/05/translate-where-you-need-it-in-any-app.html\" target=\"_blank\">blogpost</a> said of 500 million people who use Google Translate, more than 9 in 10 live outside the US.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now, you can just copy the text of a chat, comment, song lyric, etc. in whichever app you\u2019re using, and a translation will pop up right there\u2014no need to switch apps,&#8221; says Google. The feature is expected to make translations easier for those who can&#8217;t understand regional languages.</p>\n<p>Google says that it is rolling out the improvements after talking to thousands of people in India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Thailand to learn what works, and what doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Google Tap to Translate feature works for all 103 languages supported by app. It will be supported on Android smartphones running Android Jellybean (4.2) and above. Users will need to install the Google Translate app on their smartphone to experience the feature.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2796532\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/milk_chinese-english.gif\" alt=\"Google, Google Translate, Tap to Translate, Tap to Translate offline, translate for Android, Google offline mode, Google new features, Google translate new features, smartphones, technology, technology news\" /> Google also added Word Lens in Chinese.\n<p>Next up, Google&#8217;s Offline Mode allows users to download small offline language packages. According to the post, the company has shrunk the packages by 90 per cent, to make them more manageable at 25MB each. Google says that this because previous users found the &#8220;packages too big to download on unreliable data connections.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Offline Mode can be set-up by clicking the arrow next to the language name to download the relevant package. It works on iOS and Android, with Tap to Translate. Google has also added a Filipino language pack, bringing the total number of offline languages to 52.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Google also added Word Lens in Chinese. &#8220;It\u2019s 29th language for instant visual translation, and it reads both to and from English, for both Simplified and Traditional Chinese,&#8221; says Google.

The company has been shipping to India from 2012 itself, but now the products will come in Indian pricing as well as local support. The most affordable Pebble, priced at Rs 5,999, might well be the cheapest branded smartwatch in India now.</p>\n<p>Eric Migicovsky, Founder and CEO of Pebble, said India will be pebble\u2019s fifth largest market and first major after since Europe. \u201cWe already ship tens of thousands of units to India, but we had to get on the ground,\u201d he told IndianExpress.com over a video conference from California.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Migicovsky shipped his first devices to India as early as 2010, when he created the inPluse smartwatch for BlackBerry devices. That was a good two years before Pebble was listed on Kickstarter and became the most funded product in its history raking in $4.7 million in just six days against the target of $100,000. Shipping started in January 2013 and by end of 2014, they had shipped over a million devices. As per research firm Canalys, Pebble was the third largest smartwatch vendor in 2015, behind Apple and Samsung.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2796190 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/eric-migicovsky-pebble-ceo-800.jpg\" alt=\"Pebble, Pebble smartwatch, Pebble smartwatch review, Amazon, Pebble Amazon, Pebble price, Pebble specs, Pebble features, Eric Migicovsky, Pebble CEO, gadgets, technology, technology news\" /> Eric Migicovsky, Founder and CEO of Pebble, said India will be pebble\u2019s fifth largest market and first major after since Europe.\n<p>Canalys says the Indian wearable market is still in its early stages, and has the potential to grow as people become more aware of such products. \u201cBasic wearable bands such as fitness trackers that are competitively priced, are able to attract health-conscious users looking to stay shape. Smartwatches on the other hand, command a premium with better design and more sophisticated functionality with apps. High smartphone penetration would not be the only factor that pushes the growth of wearables in India,\u201d explains Jason Low, a Shanghai-based analyst at the research firm.</p>\n<p><strong>Read:\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/samsung-gear-s2-review-specs-feature/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Gear S2 review: A smartwatch that\u2019s perfect for health-tracking</a></strong></p>\n<p>\u201cOur idea was to create a smartwatch that people could wear on a regular basis. We created the first modern smartwatch and have defined the gold standard of what a great smartwatch should do,\u201d says Migicovsky. He says Pebble does not replace a phone, just complements it. It is different from competitors primarily because of its e-ink display which lets it stay on for close to a week.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have sold millions of units and have learned what people actually do with smartwatches. They use them for communication through notifications and for activity tracking,\u201d says Migicovsky, adding that this was why they have a real everyday smartwatch, which they could afford. In India, the Pebble devices will be priced between Rs 5,999 and Rs 15,999.</p>\n<p>Canalys defines devices from Pebble as smart watches, competing on the same level as the Samsung Gear S2, the Moto 360 from Motorola and others. \u201cLong battery life of the Time is appealing to users who don\u2019t want to charge their smart watches every day. All in all, it boils down to how accessible the products are to Indian buyers, and the number of localised apps that would ultimately bring value to Indian users,\u201d Low says.</p>\n<p>This is why Pebble is engaging developers in India, to get in more apps and watchfaces for the country. \u201cWe already have a few, but with the hackathons that we have planned for India, we should have a many more soon,\u201d Migicovsky says, underlining that the first hackathon in Mumbai was a huge success. Pebble is an open platform for developers, who have so far created over 13,000 apps and watchfaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Also Read:\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/titan-juxt-review-specs-price-india-features/\" target=\"_blank\">Titan Juxt #ExpressReview: Analog is the new digital, just about</a></strong></p>\n<p>Migicovsky wants to keep the company lean, and will not have a lot of people on the ground in India. \u201cWe are a small company with just 120 employees globally. That is why have partnered with Amazon which will take care of customers, sales and customers support.\u201d That should take care of what Canalys lists as one of the biggest challenges in India: getting a strong retail partner.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>\u201cIndia poses a number of challenges. Pebble\u2019s target audience is limited as Indian consumers who would consider the device are those who want to be more productive and have specific uses in their minds. Looking at the increasing trend of low-cost smartphones, affordability will be a key issue,\u201d explains Low.</p>\n<p>But Migicovsky seems certain the time has come.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/technology/\"><strong>COMING SOON: The Pebble Time Steel review</strong></a></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"il\">Pebble</span> is introducing its range starting at Rs 5,999 for Classic, Rs 9,999 for <span class=\"il\">Pebble</span> Time, Rs 13,599 for <span class=\"il\">Pebble</span> Time Round &amp; Rs 15,999 for <span class=\"il\">Pebble</span> Time Steel.</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2796184&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/pebble-ceo-founder-eric-migicovsky-pebble-smartwatch-price-features-specs-sale-amazon-india-2796184/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/pebble-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/pebble-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">pebble-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/37e53391b71d43d61c8c009f11e8f80a?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">hansaverma</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/pebble-800.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Pebble, Pebble smartwatch, Pebble smartwatch review, Amazon, Pebble Amazon, Pebble price, Pebble specs, Pebble features, Eric Migicovsky, Pebble CEO, gadgets, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/eric-migicovsky-pebble-ceo-800.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Pebble, Pebble smartwatch, Pebble smartwatch review, Amazon, Pebble Amazon, Pebble price, Pebble specs, Pebble features, Eric Migicovsky, Pebble CEO, gadgets, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>LeEco Le 1s Eco review: Content is the big play with this phone, but will you pay?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/leeco-le-1s-eco-review-specs-flipkart-sale-price-supertainment-2796097/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/leeco-le-1s-eco-review-specs-flipkart-sale-price-supertainment-2796097/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 09:10:28 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 10:40:39 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nandagopal Rajan]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech Reviews]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2796097</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Le 1s Eco is not much different from the Le 1s, which was launched earlier this year.

Here&#8217;s our full review.\n<p>Faced with the challenge of offering a differentiator for customers and diminishing margins, smartphone manufacturers are now talking about a content play. Apple with its highly monetised iTunes Store and App Store is the benchmark everyone is trying to chase. One of the first to offer integrated content in India is LeEco on its new phone, the Le 1s Eco.</p>\n<p><strong>Le 1s Eco</strong></p>\n<p>Le 1s Eco is not much different from Le 1s, which was launched earlier this year. However, Le Eco wants to sell this version as a different phone, made with India in mind. But if you look at the device it is the same as the Le 1s, no change in looks or specs. So I don&#8217;t think the hardware warrants a new review.

The other is a virtual home button on the screen that takes you to a video hub streaming live television channels from across India. This hub is powered by YuppTV, and offers a carousel with dozens of local channels.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2796111\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/le1s_big_3_1.jpg\" alt=\" Le 1s Eco sale, LeEco Le 1s Flipkart sale, LeEco Le 1s Eco Flipkart sale, Le 1s Eco review, Le 1s Eco features, Le 1s Eco specs, Le 1s Eco live tv, Le 1s Eco Supertainment package, Le 1s Eco price, Flipkart Le 1s sale, technology, technology news\" /> In terms of design and specs, Le 1s and Le 1s Eco are the same.\n<p>There will be a music streaming service too. This will be powered by Hungama, and is yet to be launched.</p>\n<p><strong>How good is the content?</strong></p>\n<p>I liked the live TV content because it gives me quick access to channels in my mother tongue. I am sure this can be a big pull for people who are away from their homes, and are looking for some local TV to beat homesickness. However, they might just choose to download the YuppTV app, and not buy an entire phone for this.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2796116\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/leeco_le1s_livetv_big.jpg\" alt=\" Le 1s Eco sale, LeEco Le 1s Flipkart sale, LeEco Le 1s Eco Flipkart sale, Le 1s Eco review, Le 1s Eco features, Le 1s Eco specs, Le 1s Eco live tv, Le 1s Eco Supertainment package, Le 1s Eco price, Flipkart Le 1s sale, technology, technology news\" /> The Live TV hub works seamlessly in Le 1s Eco.\n<p>The Live hub works seamlessly most of the times. It offers choice in resolution, which is good. You can also swipe from one channel to another with ease.</p>\n<p>However I noticed a couple of issues. The app does not load at times, and the live television is actually deferred live, late by about 90 seconds. But latter is not such a big issue as it doesn\u2019t have sports streams at the moment. Anyway, I am doing the review on a beta unit, as is the norm these days.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2796115\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/le1s_leeco_big2.jpg\" alt=\" Le 1s Eco sale, LeEco Le 1s Flipkart sale, LeEco Le 1s Eco Flipkart sale, Le 1s Eco review, Le 1s Eco features, Le 1s Eco specs, Le 1s Eco live tv, Le 1s Eco Supertainment package, Le 1s Eco price, Flipkart Le 1s sale, technology, technology news\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>I am not very convinced about the Levidi app at the moment. I guess this is where the premium content will reside, whenever it is made available. Till then it is just another YouTube aggregator.</p>\n<p><strong>Should you buy?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I think Le 1s Eco is among the best budget smartphones in the market like its earlier version. Initially, the phone has a lower price point of Rs 9,999 which makes it an even better buy. The company claims this one comes with free Le Eco membership, which will otherwise cost you Rs 4900 for the \u201cSupertainment\u201d in the first year. This is great.</p>\n<p>But with the content they have at the moment it might be tough to make people dish out Rs 499 every month. What LeEco is offering is certainly a bait worth nibbling on at the moment, but they will have to get in good, exclusive content real fast if they want to make this a sustainable business model.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/leeco-le-1s-full-review-specs-sale-price-flipkart/\" target=\"_blank\">LeEco Le 1s #ExpressReview:

drop compensation, Telecos, Supreme Court, Supreme Court on TRAI order, SC on TRAI, Regulation on call drops, Call drops, technology, technology news\" /> &#8220;We have held the impugned regulation to be ultra vires, arbitrary, unreasonable and non-transparent,&#8221; a bench comprising Justices Kurian Joseph and R F Nariman said.\n<p>Mobile phone users will not be compensated for call drops as the Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed the government\u2019s regulation, which mandated the telecom companies to pay for the deficiency in services.</p>\n<p>The apex court held the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) regulation to be \u201cmanifestly arbitrary and unreasonable\u201d since the compensation could in fact be a \u201cunjustifiable windfall\u201d for the consumers who could themselves be at fault. The regulation that had come into force on January 1 provided for Re 1 for every call drop subject to an upper limit of Rs 3 per day.</p>\n<p>Allowing a batch of appeals by the telcos, a bench of Justices Kurian Joseph and Rohinton F Nariman noted that the Trai had no empirical evidence to corroborate that call drops were attributable to deficiency in services by the service providers, especially when its own technical paper had in 2015 showed that an average of 36.9 per cent can be call drops owing to the fault of the consumer. \u201cWe, therefore, hold that a strict penal liability laid down on the erroneous basis that the fault is entirely with the service provider is manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable. Also, the payment of such penalty to a consumer who may himself be at fault, and which gives an unjustifiable windfall to such consumer, is also manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable,\u201d held the bench.</p>\n<p><b><div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/trai-regulations-on-call-drops-arbitrary-unreasonable-says-sc/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/call-drops-not-inclined-to-reconsider-regulation-centre-trai-tell-sc/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/telecom-small.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Call drops: Not inclined to reconsider regulation, Centre to SC</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/call-drops-never-crossed-2-limit-telcos-tell-sc/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/telecom-feature.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Call drops: Never crossed 2% limit, telcos tell SC</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/examine-whether-decision-of-penalty-on-call-drops-should-be-reviewed-supreme-court-to-trai/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/supreme-court-ap-t.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Examine whether decision of penalty on call drops should be reviewed: Supreme Court to Trai</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/telcos-should-pay-for-call-drops-scs-initial-view/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/telecom-feature.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Telcos should pay for call drops: SC\u2019s initial view</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/call-drops-sc-denies-interim-relief-to-telecom-operators-on-hc-order/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/telecom-small1.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Call drops: SC denies interim relief to telecom operators on HC order</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/call-drops-sc-agrees-to-hear-telcos-plea-against-compensating-subscribers/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/telecom-small.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Call drops: SC agrees to hear telcos&#039; plea against compensating subscribers</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</b></p>\n<p>It further said that the impugned regulation must be held to be manifestly arbitrary and an \u201cunreasonable restriction on the telecom firms\u2019 fundamental rights to carry on business, and is therefore struck down as such.\u201d Lending credence to the Trai\u2019s technical paper, the court said that the service provider is sought to be made to pay for call drops that may not be attributable to his fault, and the consumer receives compensation for a call drop that may be attributable to the fault of the consumer himself.</p>\n<p>\u201c&#8230; that makes the Impugned Regulation a regulation framed without intelligent care and deliberation &#8230; we are afraid that the orderly growth of the telecom sector cannot be ensured or promoted by a manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable regulation which makes a service provider pay a penalty without it being necessarily at fault,\u201d added the bench. The regulation, it said, also fell foul of the objective of the Trai Act which stipulated for an orderly growth of the telecom sector and must be held to be ultra vires the Act on this score too.</p>\n<p>Further, Quality of Service Regulations allowed service providers a 2 per cent allowance of call drops on the basis of averaging call drops per month and therefore, the companies cannot be penalised when they were complaint with this norm, said the court. It turned down Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi\u2019s request to read down the regulation for saving it from getting quashed, holding \u201cthe Authority framing the regulation must ensure that its means are as pure as its ends \u2014 only then will regulations made by it pass constitutional muster.\u201d</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794735&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/trai-regulations-on-call-drops-arbitrary-unreasonable-says-sc/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/smartphones-thinkstock-4801.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/smartphones-thinkstock-4801.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">smartphones thinkstock 480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6a37cab9e6d4aea837f1ec8082854e9f?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">adrijaroychow</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/smartphones-thinkstock-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">TRAI Call drop, Call drop compensation, Telecos, Supreme Court, Supreme Court on TRAI order, SC on TRAI, Regulation on call drops, Call drops, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 19:30:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 20:01:34 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Karthekayan Iyer]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech Reviews]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795478</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Google Chromecast Audio basically wants to be the Kindle of audio streaming hardware.

Chromecast was an effort to take over home entertainment devices and its most distinct accomplishment was to add streaming features to any television with a HDMI port.</p>\n<p>Now the company has two devices, Chromecast for TV and Chromecast Audio, geared for two different purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Google Chromecast Audio</strong></p>\n<p>Chromecast Audio is designed to turn any dumb speaker into a really smart one. Chromecast Audio is one of the easiest ways to stream music to a speaker that doesn&#8217;t boast of any modern day connectivity options.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hyGFIAtnXc#action=share\"><strong>Watch: How to setup Google Chromecast Audio</strong></a></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hyGFIAtnXc&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p><strong>Setting up Chromecast Audio</strong></p>\n<p>Chromecast Audio is dead simple gadget to set up. Most things are taken care of by Google\u2019s app and here is how you go about setting up:</p>\n<p>Step 1: Download Chromecast app on any Android or iOS device. As always, Windows fans are out of luck here.</p>\n<p>Step 2: Place Google Chromecast Audio in the area you want and power it using the supplied microUSB charging cable.</p>\n<p>Step 3: Open the Chromecast app and wait for it to detect the Chromecast Audio and click \u2018Set Me Up\u2019.</p>\n<p>Step 4: Once Chromecast app sets up the device, it shows Play Test Sound option. An option that verifies whether the speaker is connected to Chromecast Audio. Click on the icon.</p>\n<p>Step 5: Next option confirms whether you heard sound through your speakers. In most case it will be yes and if not, Google lets you say \u2018I didn&#8217;t hear it\u2019.</p>\n<p>Step 6: Next step allows you to rename your Chromecast Audio and disable Guest Mode (enabled by default).</p>\n<p>Step 7: The most important step is to allow Chromecast Audio to use your WiFi connection. It auto detects your network name. Type in the password and you are good to go.</p>\n<p>Step 8: Once connected to the same WiFi as your smartphone, Chromecast app shows you all the Chromecast enabled apps already on your smartphone. At this point, scrolling to Devices Tab shows you \u2018Ready to Cast\u2019 indication, meaning the setup has been successfully completed.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I used Chromecast Audio by connecting to Aux port of my Bluetooth speaker</p>\n<p><strong>What Google Chromecast Audio is like in real life</strong></p>\n<p>Google Chromecast setup shows how a neat software can simplify even an uphill task like setup. Google Chromecast\u2019s charm, however, lies in its design. It is round, disc-shape &#8211; small enough to fit inside your palm. The logo atop might be confused for Beats, but that\u2019s just Google\u2019s way of representing the Chromecast series.</p>\n<p>Google Chromecast Audio features just two ports &#8212; one micro-USB for powering it ON and another 3.5mm audio jack that plugs into your speaker. Interestingly, that 3.5mm audio jack works with an optical audio port as well, which music lovers will find as great addition.</p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_0362.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2795547\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_0362.jpg\" alt=\"Google Chromecast Audio features just two ports -- one micro-USB for powering it ON and another 3.5mm audio jack that plugs into your speaker\" /></a> Google Chromecast Audio features just two ports &#8212; one micro-USB for powering it ON and another 3.5mm audio jack that plugs into your speaker\n<p>Now open any of the Chromecast compatible app and start playing music. You will see a cast icon &#8211; which lets you to cast the music to Chromecast Audio. It can\u2019t get any simpler. This process works every time &#8211; glitch free. It works with Google Play Music and other popular music streaming services like Wynk Music, Saavn and TuneIn Radio. For podcast fans, Chromecast Audio offers native support for Pocket Casts app.</p>\n<p>In real life, Google Chromecast Audio works as advertised. It streamed audio instantaneously and Google claims the dual band WiFi support improves audio streaming. In my own testing, I found the audio streams to be as flawless as it would be over Bluetooth &#8211; nothing exceptional.</p>\n<p>However, there is something only Chromecast Audio can do and regular Bluetooth speaker can\u2019t. Once you hit the cast button, Google Chromecast Audio streams music directly from the Internet while your smartphone remains independent. You can continue working on your smartphone while Chromecast Audio streams the music. On the other hand, Bluetooth speaker would have played back tones for every other notification that dropped in.</p>\n<p>Chromecast supported apps still don\u2019t allow streaming from desktop, but there is support for streaming from Chrome browser with Google Cast extension.</p>\n<p>Google is pitching Chromecast Audio on the backbones of its strong audio playback and seamless WiFi support. While the dual band WiFi makes for a smooth streaming, the audio quality didn\u2019t change much. My Bose Soundlink sounded as it would with any other kind of music.</p>\n<p><strong>Google Chromecast downsides</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest issue with Google Chromecast Audio is its lack of support for prominent music streaming platform. Chromecast Audio doesn\u2019t support Apple Music, which lately has become the go-to streaming service for both Apple and non-Apple users.</p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_0358.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2795548\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_0358.jpg\" alt=\"At Rs 3,399 it may not seem much, but that price could get you a Bluetooth speaker\" /></a> At Rs 3,399 it may not seem much, but that price could get you a Bluetooth speaker\n<p>Other problem has to be the need for continuous power. Google could have worked out a way to keep it powered on in some other way.</p>\n<p>Google Chromecast\u2019s price isn&#8217;t attractive either. At Rs 3,399 it may not seem much, but that price could get you a Bluetooth speaker and let you playback music from any app that you have installed on your smartphone. It would cosy up well with your desktop and browsers too.</p>\n<p><strong>Should you buy</strong></p>\n<p>Google Chromecast Audio basically wants to be the Kindle of audio streaming hardware. It does one thing really well &#8211; streaming music.</p>\n<p>If you own a really good set of speakers from yesteryears, Google Chromecast Audio can give it brains to get online and stream music. But if you don\u2019t really have such an audio setup at home, Google Chromecast 2 would be a far sensible device to buy.</p>\n<p>Google Chromecast 2 can not only bring Internet streaming to your TV, it can also stream audio. Google Chromecast 2 is like achieving two things with one means while Chromecast Audio does one thing well at a premium.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795478&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/google-chromecast-audio-feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/google-chromecast-audio-feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">google-chromecast-audio-feat</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_0360.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Google Chromecast Audio is designed to turn any dumb speaker into a really smart one</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_0362.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Google Chromecast Audio features just two ports -- one micro-USB for powering it ON and another 3.5mm audio jack that plugs into your speaker</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_0358.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">At Rs 3,399 it may not seem much, but that price could get you a Bluetooth speaker</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Sony announces G Master brand of professional full-frame lenses</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/sony-g-master-professional-full-frame-lens-india-launch-price-features-2795292/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/sony-g-master-professional-full-frame-lens-india-launch-price-features-2795292/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 18:40:58 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 18:41:57 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Gadgets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795292</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Sony's new G Master brand of professional full frame lenses feature new SSM motor system for autofocus<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795292&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/sony-g-master-lens-big.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2795467\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/sony-g-master-lens-big.jpg\" alt=\"Sony's new G Master brand of professional full frame lenses feature new SSM motor system for autofocus (Source: Sony)\" /></a> Sony&#8217;s new G Master brand of professional full frame lenses feature new SSM motor system for autofocus (Source: Sony)\n<p>Sony India has announced the launch of new G Master brand of interchangeable lens today.

Here&#8217;s a close look at its top competition.\n<p>Meizu has officially launched its m3 note smartphone in India. The budget smartphone is Chinese company&#8217;s effort to offer a big screen, and battery smartphone to Indian consumers at a mid-range pricing. The smartphone is priced at Rs 9,999 and will be exclusively available on Amazon India and users will need to register to buy the smartphone.</p>\n<p>Meizu m3 note competes directly with <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/xiaomi/\">Xiaomi</a>&#8217;s Redmi Note 3 and LeEco Le 1s.\u00a0All the three devices feature metal unibody design, while m3 note and Redmi Note 3 have a bigger 4100mAh battery.</p>\n<p>Here is how the three devices stack up against each other in terms of just specs.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2795216\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/meizum3_chart.jpg\" alt=\"meizum3_chart\" width=\"800\" height=\"494\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Meizu m3 note:</strong> Meizu m3 note features a 5.5-inch Full HD (1920x1080p) display with Dinorex scratch-resistant glass for protection. Meizu m3 note is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6755 Helio P10 processor with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage.</p>\n<p>Meizu m3 note also comes with expandable storage up to 128GB, but uses\u00a0dual-SIM hybrid slot for\u00a0memory card. The dual-SIM device accepts nano-SIM, and has dual standby mode. On the camera front, Meizu m3 note gets a 13MP rear camera paired with 5MP front camera. Meizu m3 note basically builds on all that we loved about its predecessor m2 note and smaller sibling m2.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIk5zj8RH4I\" target=\"_blank\">Watch: Meizu m3 note First Look Video</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIk5zj8RH4I&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>The Meizu m3 note is just 8.2mm thick and weighs 163 grams. It runs Flyme UI based on Android 5.1 Lollipop and is backed by a 4100mAh battery. It will be available in Gray, Silver\u00a0and Gold colour variants.</p>\n<p><strong>LeEco Le 1s (Eco):\u00a0</strong>Le 1s has a stylish aluminium design, a fingerprint scanner on back, 3GB RAM, and 32 GB storage space. The price is Rs 10,999 and Le 1s is Flipkart exclusive.\u00a0LeEco has also launched another version of the Le 1s called Le 1s Eco, which costs Rs 9,999 and comes with the same specs. The first sale sale for the Eco version starts on May 12 on Flipkart.</p>\n<p>The Eco version has a\u00a0LeEco Membership worth Rs 4900 for one year bundled with this smartphone. Users get access to Levidi app which has movies \u00a0in over 10 different languages, along with Eros Now Movies on Demand, and live TV channels powered by YuppTV.\u00a0\u00a0The subscription also gives users access to 5-TB LeEco Drive cloud storage service.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Le 1s has a full HD display, 3GB RAM, 32GB storage space and LeEco is also promising 5TB of free cloud storage for one year.</p>\n<p>In our review, we liked the general performance of the smartphone, although it does heat up at times. It has a type-C USB charging port as well. \u00a0In <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/leeco-le-1s-one-month-review-price-specs-features/\" target=\"_blank\">a separate one month review</a>, we had however pointed out that there were network connectivity issues with the Le 1s, which users should keep in mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/leeco-le-1s-full-review-specs-sale-price-flipkart/\" target=\"_blank\">LeEco Le 1s review: This one has some major advantages</a>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Xiaomi Redmi Note 3: </strong>Redmi Note 3 is one of the best options in the market right now. \u00a0The flash sale is on Amazon and Mi.com website, every Wednesday. Amazon sale requires users to register before flash sale.</p>\n<p>It has a vivid and crisp, full HD display for its price-range, works smoothly and comes with a 4050 mAh battery, which will last more than a day and half, even with heavy usage.\u00a0We felt that the camera was a weak point for Redmi Note 3, even though it works okay in daylight.</p>\n<p>Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 also comes in a \u00a03GB RAM and 32GB storage space but that costs Rs 11,999. Redmi Note 3 has a fingerprint scanner on the back. Xiaomi has given this one an premium all-metal body design.</p>\n<p><strong>Read our full review: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/xiaomi-redmi-note-3-review-specs-sale-video-price/\" target=\"_blank\">Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 review: A stellar comeback indeed</a></strong></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795129&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/meizu-m3-note-vs-redmi-note-3-vs-le-1s-specs-battle-2795129/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/meizu-m3note-redminote3-le1s-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/meizu-m3note-redminote3-le1s-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">meizu-m3note-redminote3-le1s-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9fa26a5205a29f2c7954b0779012be5?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shrutidhaps</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/meizum3_big_1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Meizu m3 note, Meizu m3 note specs, Meizu m3 note price, Meizu m3 note Amazon, Meizu, Meizu m3 note sale, Meizu m3 note vs Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 vs LeEco Le 1s, M3 note vs redmi note 3, best budget smartphone, Meizu smartphone, Meizu m3 note pricing, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/meizum3_chart.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">meizum3_chart</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>TRAI to decide on SC order, we expect better service: Telecom Minster</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/trai-to-decide-on-sc-order-we-expect-better-service-telecom-minster-ravi-shankar-prasad-2795212/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/trai-to-decide-on-sc-order-we-expect-better-service-telecom-minster-ravi-shankar-prasad-2795212/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 16:18:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 17:07:14 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2795212</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Telecom operators' argument is resistance to install mobile towers by resident welfare associations and local authorities are main reasons for poor network that result in call drops.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2795212&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2729814\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/ravi-shankar-prasad759.jpg\" alt=\"trai call drops, call drops, phone call drops, sc call drops, call drops compensation, tech news, ravi shankar prasad, prasad call drops, india news\" /> Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad at <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a> office.

If you&#8217;re on a limited data pack, better use the WiFi to access WhatsApp from the desktop.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\">Watch all our video reviews</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>The advantage with the WhatsApp desktop app is that you don&#8217;t need to open a separate browser tab on your PC, and can instead use the app directly.</p>\n<p><em>Let us know in the comments if you&#8217;re planning to download WhatsApp&#8217;s desktop apps.\u00a0</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794483&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/whatsapp-desktop-app-windows-macs-set-up-download-how-to-use-2794483/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/whatsapp_desktop_feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/whatsapp_desktop_feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">WhatsApp_Desktop_FEAT</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9fa26a5205a29f2c7954b0779012be5?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shrutidhaps</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/whatsapp_big_1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">WhatsApp desktop app, WhatsApp app for Windows, Microsoft Windows, WhatsApp, WhatsApp app, Macintosh, WhatsApp for Mac, WhatsApp app download, WhatsApp on PC, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Mid-range phones more popular now, most phones made in India: CMR</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/mid-range-smartphone-cmr-data-q1-2016-results-india-2794465/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/mid-range-smartphone-cmr-data-q1-2016-results-india-2794465/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 09:39:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 09:39:22 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2794465</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[CMR says the higher price band accounts for nearly 22 per cent of the smartphone shipments in the quarter.  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2794465&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2794479 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/indians_smartphones_big_1.jpg\" alt=\"Smartphones, CMR, CMR Q1 India, India smartphone market, India smartphone market, India smartphone numbers, smartphones, technology, technology news\" /> In India the mid-range devices are now much more popular, beating the earlier budget category. (Representational Image: Reuters)\n<p>In India the average selling price of smartphones rose 25 per cent year-on-year, with the mid-range category (Rs 10,000-15,000) becoming more popular to beat the budget category (Rs 6,000-Rs 8,000) for the first time time, based on data from Cyber Media Research (CMR).</p>\n<p>According to CMR, while 53 mn mobile phones were shipped in the first quarter of the year in India, the market saw a 4 per cent negative growth. Out of these 53 mn, 23.6 million were smartphones, constituting 45 per cent of the shipments. Also 67 per cent of these smartphones were &#8216;made in India.&#8217;</p>\n<p>What is interesting in CMR&#8217;s data is that in the smartphone category the higher price-band has beaten the budget option, and brands are pitching mid-range phones as the market grows flat. The average selling price (ASP) was Rs 12,983 in the quarter, while it stood at Rs 10,364 in Q1 last year, indicating a year-on-year rise.</p>\n<p>CMR says the higher price band accounts for nearly 22 per cent of the smartphone shipments in the quarter. In a budget-conscious market like in India, this shows consumers are no longer just looking for the cheapest option and the dynamics have changed.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/samsung-galaxy-tab-a-2016-launch-price-specs-features-2796429/\">Samsung Galaxy Tab A (2016) specs, price and features</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/mid-range-smartphone-cmr-data-q1-2016-results-india-2794465/\">Mid-range phones more popular now, most phones made in India: CMR</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/samsung-j7-j5-2016-vs-redmi-note-3-le-1s-moto-g-turbo-2792827/\">Samsung Galaxy J5, J7 (2016) launched: Redmi Note 3, Le 1s, and other competition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/samsung-gear-fit2-gear-iconx-images-leak-2787834/\">Samsung accidentally leaks images of Gear Fit 2 and Gear IconX</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/samsung-galaxy-j5-galaxy-j7-prices-revealed-in-south-korea-2780590/\">Samsung Galaxy J5, Galaxy J7 (2016) prices revealed in South Korea</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>\u201cThis increase has been primarily due to introduction of shipments by LeEco and launch of new handsets / significant increase in shipments from Lenovo, Oppo, LG, Panasonic, Micromax, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/intex/\">Intex</a>, LYF (RJio) and Vivo in Rs 10,000 \u2013 15,000 price bands.

According to the \u2018World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends\u2019, authored by Deepak Mishra and Uwe Deichmann almost a\u00a0billion people in India still need to connect to the internet for pushing growth, creating jobs and accessing public services. The report also pointed that India has the most restrictive market regulation in retail finance and banking.</p>\n<p>228 million was the number of people in India who used internet in 2014. By comparison, more than 680 million people were using internet in China and 282 million in the United States. While India has come close to US in numbers, in terms of internet penetration it was far behind at 18 per cent as against 87 per cent in the US. The internet penetration in China stood at 49 per cent.</p>\n<p>The worldwide internet penetration rate has jumped six fold from 7 per cent in 2000 to 41 per cent in 2014. Among various regions, South Asia registered the lowest internet penetration as only 17 per cent of the population was online at the end of 2014. The Internet penetration rate nearly quadrupled in the Middle East and North Africa, from 10 per cent in 2005 to 38 per cent in 2014.</p>\n<p><b><div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/need-to-make-internet-more-accessible-in-india-world-bank-2793314/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/internet-users-in-india-to-grow-by-50-million-yearly-till-2020-report/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/internet-smqall.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Internet users in India to grow by at least 50 million yearly till 2020: report</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/in-india-bank-account-penetration-surges-but-43-dormant/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/08/money-l.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">In India bank account penetration surges, but 43% dormant</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/india-slips-in-broadband-penetration-rankings-un-report/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/09/broadband-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">India slips in broadband penetration rankings:\u00a0UN report</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/world-to-have-3-billion-internet-users-by-year-end-un/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2012/10/m_id_323289_internet.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">World to have 3 billion Internet users by year end: UN</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/indian-entrepreneurs-can-build-the-next-google-says-eric-schmidt/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/11/m_id_441069_eric_schmidt.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Indian entrepreneurs can build the next Google,says Eric Schmidt</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/web-addresses-exceed-worlds-population/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2009/07/m_id_97281_web_address.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Web addresses exceed world&#039;s population</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</b></p>\n<p>Stating that nearly a billion people still not connected to the internet, the report pointed that the opportunities for increasing access to digital technology for creating higher growth, more jobs, and better public services are significant for India as at least 8 in 10 individuals in India own a mobile phone.</p>\n<p>Releasing the report in India , Mishra said that digital development strategies in India need to be broader than Information and Communication Technology (ICT) strategies. \u201cThere is little doubt about the transformative potential of digital technologies.

Over the last six months, Facebook at Work has been capturing the interest of CIOs across the world despite being in Beta. In fact, there are over 60,000 of them on the waiting list for what it calls the most democratised of enterprise solutions.</p>\n<p>Julien Codorniou, Facebook\u2019s London-based director of platform partnerships, says the more connected people are, the more productive they become. \u201cFacebook at Work is the most significant development we have made outside Menlo Park. In fact, it is separated from Facebook, though it will leverage the significant investments made in getting to the 1.65 billion users that Facebook has,\u201d he told IndianExpress.com.</p>\n<p>Separated from Facebook is a significant statement, given it is a closed environment only for those within an organisation, and that too with administrative controls. So users will not be able to access posts from friends and family or third-party apps like Candy Crush; nor will there be ads.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SCDrKe1eGs\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch Video</strong></a></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SCDrKe1eGs&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Codorniou is in India to meet the new clients the company has got on board here, including some big names like UST Global, L&amp;T, Godrej Industries and Yes Bank, along with startups like Zomato and Delhivery. He says Indian companies have been among the fastest to adopt the new service over the past three months, and globally they are launching one or two companies everyday now.</p>\n<p>The first company on board was the Royal Bank of Scotland, and getting a bank on board seems to have put the questions of security to rest right away.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2793914 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/facebook-julien-codorniou.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook, Facebook at work, Facebook at work India, Facebook for work, Julien Codorniou, Facebook newsfeed, Facebook feed, Facebook work, social, social news, Facebook work newsfeed, Facebook work platform, FB at work, technology, technology news\" /> Julien Codorniou, Facebook\u2019s London-based director of platform partnerships, says the more connected people are, the more productive they become.\n<p>\u201cFacebook at work is based on five pillars &#8212; Newsfeed, groups, timeline or profile, work chat and search. On top of this, there is security and analytics which is exclusive to this service,\u201d says Codorniou for whom the the biggest USPs are the fact that anyone who uses Facebook can use Facebook at Work too, and that it is mobile first.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven those who don\u2019t use Facebook have no learning here,\u201d he adds, giving examples of CEOs who love the platform, but have never used the social network. This will also be the lure for weaning away people from competition like Slack and Moxtra.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the biggest advantages is that CEOs can feel the pulse of the company on the timeline. It is all about creating a workplace where news travels fast,\u201d he adds. If the timeline can\u2019t give a good idea about the mood, there are analytics to give insights.

Well, chipmaker MediaTek is surely keen on seeing this high-spec camera coming on new smartphones later this year, thanks to its Helio X20 processor.</p>\n<p>The fabless semiconductor company from Taiwan says there are \u201cone or two brands\u201d working on this capability. \u201cIt is a capability and not everyone will want to take it to the limit. Most companies will be evaluating the cost,\u201d says Arthur Wang, senior director at MediaTek.</p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/13149828_10154259369707664_1801880918_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2794001\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/13149828_10154259369707664_1801880918_n.jpg\" alt=\"MediaTek, MediaTek Helio processor, MediaTek Helio X20, MediaTek Helio X10 processor, MediaTek processors, MediaTek processors, MediaTek smartphone processors, tech news, technology\" /></a> MediaTek&#8217;s 2GHz Helio X10 claims to offer 21MP camera capability as well Full HD display support\n<p>The 2.5 GHz Helio X20 processor will offer a CAT 6 LTE modem, 2560x1600p screen support and better battery life. The 2GHz Helio p10, on the other hand, claims to offer 21MP camera capability as well Full HD screen support.</p>\n<p>MediaTek says about 15 per cent of the smartphones it sold in 2015 had LTE capability. In fact, the company claims to have powered over 1.5 billion devices, out of which just 400 million were smartphones. The company claims a 33 per cent market share in India with about 33 million units shipped with its processors.</p>\n<p>Though still struggling to make a mark in markets like the US, where it has been unable to enter due to its inability to support Cat 7, 9 networks, MediaTek is bullish on the success of LTE in India. In fact, the company wants to double its LTE numbers in India by the end of the year. It is also going to test Video Over LTE in India by Q3, Wang said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2793992&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/mediatek-helio-processor-32mp-camera-support-2793992/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/mediatek-helio-logo-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/mediatek-helio-logo-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">mediatek-helio-logo-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/13183169_10154259369587664_224247018_n.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">MediaTek, MediaTek Helio processor, MediaTek Helio X20, MediaTek Helio X10 processor, MediaTek processors, MediaTek processors, MediaTek smartphone processors, tech news, technology</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/13149828_10154259369707664_1801880918_n.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">MediaTek, MediaTek Helio processor, MediaTek Helio X20, MediaTek Helio X10 processor, MediaTek processors, MediaTek processors, MediaTek smartphone processors, tech news, technology</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Moto X 2016 could come in two variants and feature modular design</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/moto-x-2016-modular-smartphone-leak-specs-price-2793979/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/moto-x-2016-modular-smartphone-leak-specs-price-2793979/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 19:26:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 20:55:21 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mobile & Tabs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2793979</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Motorola's next Moto X smartphones will feature metal unibody design and come with modular back plates<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2793979&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/moto-x-2016-big.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2793984\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/moto-x-2016-big.jpg\" alt=\"Motorola's next Moto X smartphones will feature metal unibody design and come with modular back plates (Source: hellomotoHK/Google+)\" /></a> Motorola&#8217;s next Moto X smartphones will feature metal unibody design and come with modular back plates (Source: hellomotoHK/<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a>+)\n<p>Motorola is reportedly working on two new flagship handsets in the Moto X series.

Here&#8217;s our first impression of the device.\n<p>Micromax Canvas 6 is the new flagship smartphone from India\u2019s second largest mobile manufacturer. While\u00a0Micromax is holding on to the\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/lenovo-apple-growing-fastest-in-india-micromax-falls-sharply-canalys/\">second position in the market</a>, it is being challenged by newer players, especially those from China.</p>\n<p>Canvas 6 is a comeback device, one that will show Micromax is still capable of delivering a solid mid-budget phone.\u00a0At Rs 13,999, this is\u00a0the\u00a0first metal, unibody Canvas device with a fingerprint scanner on the back.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-nominates-six-indian-start-ups-for-its-launchpad-accelerator-program-2798437/\">Google nominates six Indian start-ups for its &#039;Launchpad Accelerator&#039; program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/\">Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-tap-to-translate-will-work-across-android-app-how-to-use-2796516/\">Google Tap to Translate will now work inside any app on Android: Here&#039;s how</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/\">Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-free-wifi-launched-for-ujjain-jaipur-patna-guwahati-allahabad-stations-2793095/\">Google free WiFi arrives at Ujjain, Jaipur, Patna, Guwahati and Allahabad stations</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>But is the new Canvas 6 good enough to compete with other phones in this price-range where contenders like <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/xiaomi/\">Xiaomi</a> Redmi Note 3, Le 1s, Moto G Turbo\u00a0are lurking to make the kill?</p>\n<p>We\u00a0have been using the smartphone for the last two-three days,\u00a0and here\u00a0is what we thought.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783gIQLMckE\">Watch our first look video for the Canvas 6\u00a0</a>\u00a0</strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783gIQLMckE&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p><strong>Design, Display:</strong> Canvas 6 has a full-metal unibody design that\u00a0comes with a 5.5-inch full HD display. The design is more on the rectangular side, and Canvas 6 is one of the heavier smartphones in this price band. \u00a0I felt the Redmi and\u00a0Le 1s were lighter and felt better to grip. The\u00a0metal unibody aside, the phone feels a little boring.</p>\n<p>The 5.5-inch full HD display is quite good with nice-viewing angles, just like on the Canvas 6 Pro. However, it is prone to smudges, and I\u00a0have noticed three scratches on the glass already.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2793640 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/micromaxcanvas6_big_3.jpg\" alt=\"Micromax Canvas 6, Canvas 6, Micromax Canvas 6 sale, Canvas 6 price, Canvas 6 specs, Canvas 6 vs Canvas 6 Pro, Canvas 6 Pro vs Redmi Note 3, Canvas 6 vs Redmi Note 3, mobiles, smartphones, technology, technology news\" /> Canvas 6 has a fingerprint scanner on the back.\n<p><strong>Processor, Storage and General Performance:</strong> Canvas 6 has 3 GB RAM, 1.3 Ghz octa-core MediaTek processor. This is also the first Micromax device with 32GB storage space, which is good. There\u00a0is a hybrid dual-SIM slot with space for a micro-SD. The slot is not particularly well-designed, and the\u00a0nano-SIM slots can be a bit confusing.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/micromax-canvas-6-pro-review-specs-price-2793178/\" target=\"_blank\">Micromax Canvas 6 Pro #ExpressReview: Being \u2018Pro\u2019 is not a cakewalk</a></strong></p>\n<p>Also on the first slot, I could only get a Edge connection. This after the phone took more than five attempts to detect\u00a0the SIM.</p>\n<p>In terms of general performance, the Canvas 6 can handle your daily needs like browsing the web, gaming, etc. We\u00a0will have more once we have run it through the benchmark tests.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2793641\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/micromaxcanvas6_big_2.jpg\" alt=\"Micromax Canvas 6, Canvas 6, Micromax Canvas 6 sale, Canvas 6 price, Canvas 6 specs, Canvas 6 vs Canvas 6 Pro, Canvas 6 Pro vs Redmi Note 3, Canvas 6 vs Redmi Note 3, mobiles, smartphones, technology, technology news\" /> Canvas 6 is definitely one of the more bulkier smartphones.\n<p><strong>Software:</strong> Canvas 6 runs Android 5.1 and comes with Micromax\u2019s <em>Around</em> Service. As\u00a0I have said earlier,\u00a0<em>Around</em> does a good job of aggregating services, but needs better execution. In the Canvas 6, I kept trying to book an Ola cab using\u00a0<em>Around,\u00a0</em>and it would open a tab asking me to log into Ola. Before I could do so, the tab would crash.</p>\n<p>Also,\u00a0I had\u00a0issues with the\u00a0fingerprint scanner.\u00a0It seemed to like my second finger more and even with that it did not have a cent per cent success rate. The scanner controls are in a separate tab called Fingerprint. Micromax will need to fix this\u00a0problem.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2793645\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/micromaxcanvas6_big_4.jpg\" alt=\"Micromax Canvas 6, Canvas 6, Micromax Canvas 6 sale, Canvas 6 price, Canvas 6 specs, Canvas 6 vs Canvas 6 Pro, Canvas 6 Pro vs Redmi Note 3, Canvas 6 vs Redmi Note 3, mobiles, smartphones, technology, technology news\" /> Fingerprint scanner has not worked at all for us in the Canvas 6.\n<p><strong>Camera:</strong> The 13 megapixel rear camera and 8 megapixel camera are not really impressive. In one set of selfies I look like a white ghost with purple lipstick. I\u2019m okay with the idea of purple lipstick, but honestly this camera can\u2019t handle reds or pinks. More on this once we\u2019ve taken a few more shots with the camera.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2793664\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/canvas6_1.jpg\" alt=\"Sample picture. (Resized for web) \" /> Sample picture.

In 2016, a full HD display, extra RAM, a 13MP camera, metal body\u00a0are\u00a0quite common. The Rs 15,000 and under price band in India is booming with options.

In a prepaid market like India, any bundled offering may be very different from the handset-subsidy model popular in several other markets,&#8221; it said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unlike the bundling of the phone with the service, we expect Reliance to bundle the service with phones,&#8221; it said, adding Jio may offer a phone for around Rs 3,400 and free services in the first 3 months, which can cover a part of the handset price and reduce the cost of ownership.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/reliance-jio-service-may-benefit-from-lyf-4g-handset-subsidies-heres-why-2793620/\">Reliance Jio service may benefit from LYF 4G handset subsidies: Here&#039;s why</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/reliance-lyf-water-5-launch-price-specs-features-amazon-india-2792146/\">Reliance LYF Water 5 launched at Rs 11,699; will be Amazon exclusive</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/bsnl-in-talks-with-reliance-jio-vodafone-for-a-2g-roaming-agreement/\">BSNL in talks with Reliance Jio, Vodafone for a 2G roaming agreement</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/reliance-jio-employee-referral-programme-evokes-hope-and-hype-clsa/\">Reliance Jio employee referral launch will boost 4G usage: CLSA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/reliance-jio-4g-sim-how-to-buy-2787577/\">Reliance Jio 4G-ready SIM via employee referral: Here&#039;s how it works</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>&#8220;In fact, in the recently launched invite-based scheme, Jio is offering unlimited 4G data, 1,500 voice minutes and 9,000 SMS free for three months on purchase of a LYF phone,&#8221; it said referring to the scheme under which each employee is allowed to extend the offer to 10 friends.</p>\n<p>The brokerage was also upbeat on the use of 4G in India.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a useful starting point to note India already had 30 million 4G smartphones as of December 2015, and this is likely to have risen to 47 million by March 2016. Pertinently, the share of 4G smartphones in mobilephone shipments has risen sharply to 54 percent in Q3 of 2015-16,&#8221; it said.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, it said 4G handsets will average 63-75 percent of the total smartphone shipments in India in 2016-17 and the year after, taking the total 4G penetration in the country to 212 million, or 18 percent, by March 2018 &#8212; and further to 500 million by the 5th year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Reliance&#8217;s own LYF brand of 4G phones and bundled offerings could enable a stronger push. In any case, this forecast clearly highlights that the size of India&#8217;s 4G smartphone market is not likely to be a limiting factor for Reliance&#8217;s ambitions,&#8221; it said.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>&#8220;It may be relevant to note that after the launch of China Mobile&#8217;s 4G services, 4G phones have made up almost 90 percent of total mobile-phone shipments to China in 2015. This was mainly due to big push made by ChinaMobile for 4G phones to subscribers, which included handset subsidies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Maintaining that higher penetration of 4G devices will be a basic requirement for Jio&#8217;s success, it also sought to allay concerns over how Reliance Industries will be able to face the biggest challenge of persuading consumers to buy new 4G devices to experience Jio&#8217;s services.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2793620&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/reliance-jio-service-may-benefit-from-lyf-4g-handset-subsidies-heres-why-2793620/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/relieance-lyf-earth-front-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/relieance-lyf-earth-front-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">relieance-lyf-earth-front-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/37e53391b71d43d61c8c009f11e8f80a?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">hansaverma</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/relieance-lyf-earth-front-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Reliance, Reliance Jio, Reliance LYF, Reliance 4G services, 4G, Reliance 4G SIM, how to get Reliance 4G SIM, LYF handsets, smartphones, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Micromax Canvas 6 Pro #ExpressReview: Being \u2018Pro\u2019 is not a cakewalk</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/micromax-canvas-6-pro-review-specs-price-2793178/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/micromax-canvas-6-pro-review-specs-price-2793178/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 16:45:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 16:49:26 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Shruti Dhapola]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech Reviews]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2793178</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Micromax Canvas 6 Pro is a decent smartphone but it won't appeal to everyone<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2793178&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8269.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2793597\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8269.jpg\" alt=\"micromax, micromax canvas 6 pro, micromax canvas 6 pro review, micromax canvas 6 pro specs, micromax canvas 6 pro price, micromax canvas 6 pro features, smartphones, mobiles, Android, tech news, technology\" /></a> Micromax Canvas 6 Pro comes with more 4GB RAM, an all plastic body, 16GB storage space and no fingerprint scanner. It is priced at Rs 13,999.\n<p>Micromax has launched Canvas 6 Pro and Canvas 6 as its new flagships. The company has also been running a loud, and perhaps a bit odd, TV ad campaign to promote its new smartphones.</p>\n<p>Micromax, which wants to join the list of top five smartphone players in the world by 2020, now wants to promote its services side as well. The new Canvas 6 series comes with \u2018Around\u2019 service, an earlier version of which was seen on the Yu Yutopia smartphone.</p>\n<p>Micromax claims it is aiming for glory, and the Canvas 6 Pro is supposed to be the first salvo in this grand attempt at rejig. But does the Canvas 6 Pro live up to the hype of nuts, guts and glory ? Here\u2019s our review</p>\n<p><strong>Micromax Canvas 6 Pro</strong></p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8270.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2793598\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8270.jpg\" alt=\"micromax, micromax canvas 6 pro, micromax canvas 6 pro review, micromax canvas 6 pro specs, micromax canvas 6 pro price, micromax canvas 6 pro features, smartphones, mobiles, Android, tech news, technology\" /></a> Micromax Canvas 6 Pro\u2019s rear cover is removable as is the battery and users can insert a nano-SIM, a micro-SIM and a microSD card in the back\n<p>If Canvas 6 Pro was the only device that Micromax had launched, it would have been an okay smartphone. But here\u2019s the deal: next to the Canvas 6, which is priced the same and yet to hit the stores, the Pro seems outright over-priced.</p>\n<p>Why? Canvas 6 is all metal and comes with a fingerprint scanner, while the Pro\u2019s big USP is the extra RAM, 4GB to be precise). It also has an all plastic body, less storage space (16GB vs 32GB in Canvas 6) and no fingerprint scanner.</p>\n<p>Given that the mid-budget market has options like Redmi Note 3, Le 1s, etc with a fingerprint scanner, all metal body and 32GB storage space, Canvas 6 Pro might not be the first choice for the well-informed buyer.</p>\n<p>When it comes to looks, Canvas 6 Pro\u2019s design is nothing revolutionary. It\u2019s the same plastic body, prone to fingerprint smudges, with the Micromax logo bang in the middle of the rear body. Frankly, this phone looks very 2013.</p>\n<p>The smartphone\u2019s rear cover is removable as is the battery, and users can insert a nano-SIM, a micro-SIM and a microSD card on the back. The speakers are on the bottom of the back cover and it\u2019s a slightly curved design.</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong> 5.5-inch full HD display | MediaTek Helio X10 octa-core processor | 4GB RAM+ 16GB storage space (expandable) | 13MP rear camera + 5MP front camera | Android 5.1 Lollipop | 3000 mAh battery</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Rs 13,999</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXYHGflhaww\"><strong>Watch: Micromax Canvas 6 Pro Video Review</strong></a></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXYHGflhaww&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p><strong>So what\u2019s good?</strong></p>\n<p>The Canvas 6 Pro is one of the few Micromax smartphones to sport a 5.5-inch full HD display. It works fine inside a room and in sunlight, and has pretty good viewing angles. Micromax has done a good job on this count. Only word of caution would be that this display collects a lot of fingerprints. Use a screen-guard with this one.</p>\n<p>According to Micromax, this phone is all about performance thanks to the 4GB RAM along with Helio MediaTek Helio X10 Tru-octa processor. The phone\u2019s performance is decent, but nothing spectacular. In the Antutu tests we ran, the Canvas 6 Pro came in at number 21 below the Le 1s, Meizu MX5.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/canvas6pro_sample3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2793603\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/canvas6pro_sample3.jpg\" alt=\"micromax, micromax canvas 6 pro, micromax canvas 6 pro review, micromax canvas 6 pro specs, micromax canvas 6 pro price, micromax canvas 6 pro features, smartphones, mobiles, Android, tech news, technology\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" /></a></p>\n<p>Benchmark tests aside, the Canvas 6 Pro is capable of handling multi-tasking for your regular day. However, a longer session of the gaming leaves the phone pretty warm around the top part, and there were times when I felt a noticeable lag on the phone, especially when trying to clear too many tabs.</p>\n<p>Around, which is the company\u2019s aggregated services platform, is an interesting idea that does solve some problems. Users have to swipe right and the Service shows up with options to order Food (via Zomato app), do some Shopping (powered by Scandid), book cabs, buses, flights, hotels, or train tickets, all from this one place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/canva6pro_sample4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2793604\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/canva6pro_sample4.jpg\" alt=\"micromax, micromax canvas 6 pro, micromax canvas 6 pro review, micromax canvas 6 pro specs, micromax canvas 6 pro price, micromax canvas 6 pro features, smartphones, mobiles, Android, tech news, technology\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" /></a></p>\n<p>These are services that lot of users might try and access, and Around lets them do it without having to open too many apps. However, there are issues, which I\u2019ll discuss next.</p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s not good?</strong></p>\n<p>Around is not entirely accurate or well built. For instance typing \u2018red shoes\u2019 for the shopping option, shows books, music, etc on top before actually getting to the shoes. When I tried clicking on a pair of red heels, the page linked to ShopClues website. I kept tapping buy, but nothing happened, so I gave up.</p>\n<p>The food bit in Zomato lets you directly call a restaurant, but there\u2019s no menu or any other tab that you can open, meaning you\u2019d still be dependent on the app, unless you know the menu by heart. Given that Zomato now lets you order online from app itself, \u2018Around\u2019 leaves out a crucial element.</p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8276.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2793605\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8276.jpg\" alt=\"micromax, micromax canvas 6 pro, micromax canvas 6 pro review, micromax canvas 6 pro specs, micromax canvas 6 pro price, micromax canvas 6 pro features, smartphones, mobiles, Android, tech news, technology\" /></a> Micromax has already installed quite a few apps on their smartphone\n<p>The camera on this smartphone is nothing impressive either. While the 13MP rear camera is pretty fast, the colours are washed out. The selfie camera just doesn\u2019t feel like 5MP.</p>\n<p>A Pro smartphone needs a battery that can last and sadly that\u2019s not the case with the Canvas 6 Pro. In our battery tests, it lasted around 8 hours, which is not acceptable in this price range where the competition is offering 24 hours battery life, often at lesser price. Even with moderate usage the battery life is around 8-10 hours and for most users that won\u2019t be enough. Micromax\u2019s Canvas 6 Pro is also prone to heating at times, which again makes it harder to gauge the battery performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>\n<p>Overall, the Canvas 6 Pro is a decent smartphone from Micromax, but nothing exceptional. The bigger problem in recommending this smartphone is that on paper, the Canvas 6 has more storage space (32GB), a better selfie camera (8MP front camera), better design (all metal body) and a fingerprint scanner.</p>\n<p>Plus options like the Redmi Note 3, Le 1s offer much better specs and performance and are cheaper than the Canvas 6 Pro.</p>\n<p>For users who might be considering a Micromax, the Canvas 6 Pro might not be that appealing. After all most users don\u2019t buy a phone simply because it has 4GB RAM.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

million euros a year earlier.\n<p>Nokia reported Tuesday a first-quarter net loss of 513 million euros ($584 million) due to lower demand in mobile networks as well as the impact of its acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, and warned of a further decline in earnings.</p>\n<p>In the company&#8217;s first earnings report since the 15.6-billion-euro acquisition, Nokia said the loss compared with a profit of 177 million euros a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Net sales were 5.5 billion euros, compared with the 2.9 billion euros it reported a year earlier. Combined net sales in the period in 2015 would have come in at 6.1 billion euros, Nokia said.</p>\n<p>CEO Rajeev Suri described the revenue decline as disappointing and said the climate remained &#8220;challenging&#8221; in mobile networks. He warned of further cuts and layoffs as the company searched for savings with the merger. He did not give figures but said that layoffs had begun globally, including in the United States.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/nokia-q1-revenue-decline-mobile-networks-2793321/\">Nokia Q1 revenue decline on the back of poor mobile networks demand</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/nokia-withings-deal-fitness-health-monitoring/\">Nokia to buy digital health tracking firm Withings for $191 million</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/nokia-2g-3g-4g-mobile-traffic-india/\">Mobile traffic grew 50% last year: Nokia study</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/nokia-230-dual-sim-launched-in-india-at-rs-3949/\">Nokia 230 Dual SIM launched in India at Rs 3,949</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/nokia-to-close-here-maps-deal-with-german-automakers/\">Nokia to close HERE maps deal with German automakers</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>Nokia&#8217;s share price fell 2 percent to 4.90 euros in early morning trading in Helsinki.</p>\n<p>Hannu Rauhala, senior analyst at Inderes, an independent equity research company, said the result was much as expected.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was good and bad. Nokia&#8217;s profitability was good and the gross margins were good, but the outlook was poorer than market expectations,&#8221; Rauhala said. &#8220;The integration process with Alcatel is still ongoing and it&#8217;s always difficult to predict how that is going to progress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sales in Nokia&#8217;s main networks sector dropped 8 percent in the period, mainly because of a 12 percent decline in Ultra Broadband Networks, Nokia said. Its networks operations in North America, which became its largest market with the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, fell by 17 percent to 1.58 billion euros. Europe, its second biggest market, saw a decline of 3 percent to 1.2 billion euros. Only the small Latin American segment showed a slight improvement of 6 percent.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>The Finnish company&#8217;s other sector, Nokia Technologies, which controls the company&#8217;s huge portfolio of patents, saw sales fall 27 percent from a year earlier to 198 million euros.</p>\n<p>Suri said Nokia had earlier noted it expected some &#8220;market headwinds in 2016 in the wireless sector, and we continue to hold that view today.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Also Read:\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/pc-shipments-at-lowest-point-since-q2-2011-says-canalys/\" target=\"_blank\">PC shipments at lowest point since Q2 2011, says Canalys</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read:\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/mobile-connectivity-to-reach-55669-villages-by-march-2019-dot/\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile connectivity to reach 55,669 villages by March 2019: DoT</a></strong></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2793321&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/nokia-q1-revenue-decline-mobile-networks-2793321/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/nokia.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/nokia.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">nokia</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/37e53391b71d43d61c8c009f11e8f80a?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">hansaverma</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/nokia-withings-deal-main.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Nokia, Nokia sales, Nokia Q1 sales, Nokia Q1 results, Nokia smartphones, Nokia smartphones, Nokia profit, Nokia sales drop, smartphones, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Xiaomi Mi Max with 6.44-inch display launched in China: Key specs, price and more</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/xiaomi-mi-max-display-launched-specs-price-china-miui8-2793163/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/xiaomi-mi-max-display-launched-specs-price-china-miui8-2793163/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 14:10:53 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 08:23:50 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mobile & Tabs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2793163</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Xiaomi Mi Max has a giant 6.44-inch display, and all metal body.

They are definitely raising the profile of streaming. It is hard to build an industry on your own,&#8221; Jonathan Forster, a vice president and one of its first employees, told Reuters in an interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since Apple Music started we&#8217;ve been growing quicker and adding more users than before.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/spotify-apple-music-growth-music-streaming-services-2793121/\">Spotify says growth has quickened since Apple Music launch</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/spotify-will-let-musicians-reserve-new-releases-for-paid-subscribers/\">Spotify will let musicians reserve new releases for paid subscribers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/spotify-gets-115-mn-investment-from-teliasonera-as-apple-music-launches/\">Spotify gets $115 mn investment from TeliaSonera as Apple Music launches</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/spotify-to-unveil-free-mobile-streaming-service/\">Spotify to unveil free mobile streaming service</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/youtube-readying-paid-music-service-reports/\">YouTube readying paid music service: reports</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>&#8220;It would be terrible if we were just taking each other&#8217;s users or to learn there was just a ceiling of 100 million users &#8211; I don&#8217;t think that is the case,&#8221; said Forster, who had just returned to Stockholm from the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California.</p>\n<p>Spotify now has 30 million paying users, making it the market leader in music streaming, while Apple Music has reported having 13 million paying subscribers since its launch last year in over 100 countries.</p>\n<p>But the company is facing competition on more fronts than just Apple, from players such as Pandora Media Inc and newer rivals such as German start-up SoundCloud and U.S. music producer and rapper Jay Z&#8217;s Tidal. Meanwhile Alphabet Inc&#8217;s <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> is competing with both YouTube and Google Play Music.</p>\n<p>Forster said having multiple streaming services was not sustainable in the long run.</p>\n<p>Asked about acquisition possibilities, Forster said future purchases would be on a similar scale to its recent deals in order to bring on new teams and technology.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see Spotify continue to invest in areas that are relevant or adjacent to our business,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Revenues will continue to come largely from subscriptions but Spotify will also hunt for other income in areas such as concerts, merchandising and video, though Forster was quick to add that the company was &#8220;not trying to be a Netflix &#8220;.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>&#8220;My Internet history would tell me that there&#8217;s probably not going to be that many significant players, and then maybe smaller niche cases &#8230; maybe there could be a classical music streaming service,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a hard business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company on Monday launched a new video offering which will include exclusive content, like short, behind-the-scenes videos of artists.</p>\n<p>And Spotify has no intention of slowing its pace of expansion, having said in March that it had raised $1 billion in convertible debt from U.S. firms TPG Capital and Dragoneer Investment Group.</p>\n<p>Forster said that it was reassuring that the company&#8217;s conversion rate for turning new users of the advertising-based service into subscribers, had held up at 25 to 30 percent, despite its user growth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That should have a negative effect on the conversion rate but it hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Asked whether Spotify could be an acquisition target for a larger technology company like Google or <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/facebook/\">Facebook</a>, Forster said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve always felt Spotify likes being Spotify. We have fought to get to where we are today and we are quite happy and it would be emotionally hard not to be us, but who knows?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that people have really woken up to the opportunity of streaming. We can see that it is just the beginning.

We take a look at their biggest competition.\n<p>Samsung Galaxy J7, J5 (2016) editions have been launched in India; both smartphones are Flipkart exclusive. Samsung has continued with mid-range pricing that we saw in the previous J-series. The Galaxy J5 starts at Rs 13,990, while the bigger Galaxy J7 has a Rs 15,990 price-tag.</p>\n<p>Samsung says that the J series is their largest selling smartphone one in India, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/idc-q1-smartphone-growth-falls-top-five-players-samsung-apple-2773954/\" target=\"_blank\">and according to a recent IDC report</a>, this brand has helped the company win over many first-time, and budget conscious smartphone users in emerging markets.</p>\n<p>In India, the J7 comes with 2GB RAM and an HD display, not the full HD display and 3GB RAM we&#8217;ve seen in China or South Korea version. Both smartphones also run the latest Android Marshmallow OS, which is not so common in this price-band.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s the competition like for the Samsung J7, J5 (2016) series in India?

The back cover, and battery is removable in both.</p>\n<p>Galaxy J7 has a 5.5-inch HD AMOLED display, while Galaxy J5 gets a smaller 5.2-inch HD AMOLED display. Unlike many other phones in this price-band, the new J7 and J5 don&#8217;t have a full HD display.\u00a0But based on our first impressions of the phones, we&#8217;d say the display is pretty sharp and vivid in both.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2792925\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/samsungj5_big_2.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung J7, J5, J7 Flipkart, J series 2016 Flipkart, Galaxy J7 price, Galaxy J7 specs, Galaxy J5, Galaxy J5 price, Galaxy J5 specs, J7 vs Redmi Note 3 vs Le 1s, J5 vs J7, Le 1s or Samsung J7, Samsung J7 vs Moto G Turbo, smartphones, technology, technology news\" /> Samsung Galaxy J5 comes with a 13 megapixel rear camera and 5 megapixel front camera.\n<p>Samsung Galaxy J7 is powered by an Exynos 1.6Ghz octa-core processor coupled with 2 GB RAM, while Galaxy J5 has a 1.2 Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor paired with 2 GB RAM.

In terms of the competition, all three phones are worthy challengers for the 2016 J series.\u00a0But the South-Korean tech giant is the bigger and more well-known brand compared to the other players in India, which might appeal to some users.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

Chinese market saw its third consecutive quarter of double-digit declines.\n<p>Worldwide PC shipments, which includes desktops, notebooks, two-in-ones and tablets, dipped 13 per cent year-on-year to reach their lowest point since Q2 2011, research firm Canalys said.</p>\n<p>As 101 million units were shipped in Q1 2016, Apple continued to lead with shipments of just over 14 million units, despite falling 17 per cent, as Lenovo shipped some 25,000 units less than Apple.</p>\n<p>Only two-in-ones grew in the entire segment at just over 13 per cent, while tablets continue to be the worst affected category with shipments falling around 15 per cent to just under 39 million units.</p>\n<p>According to Canalys, &#8220;all PC categories in Asia Pacific continue to experience weakness, affected by improving quality and falling prices in the smartphone market.&#8221; In low-income markets, notebooks and tablets are no longer must-have products and multiple device ownership is becoming less common, it said.

The tablet market in the US was aided by shipments of large screen detachable tablets such as the iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 4.</p>\n<p>Shipments of two-in-ones and detachable tablets are expected to continue to do well in the US and will grow in high income markets. New form factors will trigger an increase in PC ASPs, benefitting the two-in-one and tablet categories at the expense of notebooks,&#8221; the report said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The global PC market had a bad start to 2016 and it is difficult to see any bright spots for vendors in the coming quarters. The tablet boom has faded in the distance and the market is fully mature. Global shipment declines are expected to continue unless vendors bring transformational innovation to the market,&#8221; commented Tim Coulling, Canalys Senior Analyst.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>He said Apple and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a> were propping up shipments in established markets with their detachables, but price points make them less affordable in low-income countries. Coulling added that cheaper alternatives from other vendors are unlikely to have a big impact on volumes in the short term. &#8220;The number of people looking to buy their first PC is at an all-time low and 2016 is likely to bring yet more turmoil to global PC vendors.&#8221;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2792156&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/pc-shipments-at-lowest-point-since-q2-2011-says-canalys/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/lenovo-yoga-pad-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/lenovo-yoga-pad-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">lenovo-yoga-pad-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/37e53391b71d43d61c8c009f11e8f80a?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">hansaverma</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/lenovo-yoga-pad-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Apple, Lenovo, PC, desktop, laptop, Canalys report, canalys report on PC, PC sales Q1, Q1 results, quater 1 results, smartphones, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Reliance LYF Water 5 launched at Rs 11,699; will be Amazon exclusive</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/reliance-lyf-water-5-launch-price-specs-features-amazon-india-2792146/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/reliance-lyf-water-5-launch-price-specs-features-amazon-india-2792146/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 18:25:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 18:25:46 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mobile & Tabs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2792146</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Reliance LYF Water 5  comes with a 13 megapixel rear camera with manual HDR, 6x digital zoom and more. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2792146&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2792150 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/reliance-water5-759.jpg\" alt=\"Reliance, Reliance Jio, Reliance LYF, Reliance LYF Water 5, Reliance LYF Water 5 launch, Reliance LYF Water 5 price, Reliance LYF Water 5 specs, Reliance LYF Water 5 features, Amazon, 4G SIM, Reliance 4G, how to get Reliance 4G SIM, smartphones, technology, technology news\" /> Reliance LYF Water 5 comes with a 13 megapixel rear camera with manual HDR, 6x digital zoom and more.\n<p>Reliance has introduced a new smartphone in its LYF series called LYF Water 5 at Rs 11,699.

We spoke to AVP Product Anish Tripathi on why design matters in technology.\n<p>If you love watching movies or are a fan of theatre in your city, chances are that you\u2019ve used BookMyShow to get a ticket. The website, which is India\u2019s largest online movie and event ticketing platform, has recently seen a design revamp for its desktop version.</p>\n<p>BookMyShow claims the redesign has resulted in drop in bounce rate (by 60 per cent), and more user engagement. So can design really boost the numbers for a commerce portal, get consumers to engage more?</p>\n<p>We spoke to Anish Tripathi, AVP Product Design at BookMyShow on why design is central to a product, and how it can give a boost in both user numbers, and revenue. Below is an edited version of the interaction:</p>\n<p><strong>What are the big changes that BookMyShow made? What was the focus in the new design?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anish Tripathi (AT):</strong> We rewrote the code completely and went with a magazine-like approach in the new design. Now, we have utilised a lot of the screen space with images from production houses and event organisers. Our Showcase is kind of the homepage, and the landing page as well. These are actually sponsored spots, and they look pretty native. We\u2019ve monetised it, but made sure it is not intrusive.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve added a new section called Experiences, which is a curated collection of events on BookMyShow, to discover events in a better way. Additionally, there are features where you can pick the timing for the previous show, the next show from the seat selection page itself, without going back all the time.</p>\n<p>There are smaller experiences that users might not realise. For instance, while you are booking a seat, the call to action is not highlighted, but once you\u2019ve confirmed the seat, it will light up. It diverts your attention to \u201chey this is where I have to click next\u201d.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be able to find information in a lot better fashion, hence the engagement has increased. Our transactions have also gone up.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2791999 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bookmyshow_anish_1.jpg\" alt=\"BookMyShow, BookMyShow design revamp, BookMyShow discount, BookMyShow offers, BookMyShow Anish Tripathi, technology, technology news\" /> BookMyShow AVP Anish Tripathi.\n<p><strong>How important is design to a product such as yours?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AT:</strong> Design is, of course, very important; and it can help decide how to transform the experience for users. To some extent they know which movie they want to watch, and which location, timing of show, etc, but they go through the process in a specific fashion because you architect it that way. You can either make this process completely difficult, or totally easy.</p>\n<p>There are some four, five principles of design and if all of these align like the stars, like information, architecture, findability; your interface is proper, it will work. We are very, very serious about making our design conversational, an interface that talks to you, tells you what you need to do next.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you say that design can boost numbers, result in more transactions? What sort of impact has this revamp made for BookMyShow?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AT:</strong> The biggest challenge in the redesign was not to disrupt the base consumer behaviour of booking a ticket. We don\u2019t want to make it more difficult, but we made it a little more flexible. The word flexible is very important here.\u00a0We have basically allowed users to do somethings on particular screens that they were not able to do before. Show timings on the seat layout, being able to combine the order summary on the seat layout, etc.</p>\n<p>We know we\u2019ve made a lot of effort to get a user up to a particular stage, so allow them to do all the changes they want by not going back. Frankly, it takes a lot of effort to get a user to that particular screen.</p>\n<p>Biggest change has been to keep a user where they are, and we have a very linear flow to our website, you pick a movie, you pick a time, then you a pick seat and move to the transaction page. Making it more flexible meant that more people landed up on the payments page.</p>\n<p>Compared to the industry our transaction payment conversions are a bit higher, and it\u2019s definitely gone up post the redesign. There are also some smart interactions on the payments page that have increased transactions. We not only increased the impressions number on a page, but we also increased the conversions by redesigning the payments page as well to show offers, the wallet, and other options.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2792001\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bookmyshow_big_2.jpg\" alt=\"BookMyShow, BookMyShow design revamp, BookMyShow discount, BookMyShow offers, BookMyShow Anish Tripathi, technology, technology news\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Can you elaborate on the flexible design bit? Also did you take user feedback during the redesign?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AT:</strong> So if you click on movies, there\u2019s this whole page that pops up. We have added features like the ability to pick language, movie formats have been clubbed together, that has really helped us because in some cases the format is what people are looking at. For instance, someone might want to watch Captain America only in IMAX.</p>\n<p>Earlier, on the showtime page, you were not able to filter based on certain parameters, we have introduced price as well as a filter. I would sum it up as a discover, decide, book.</p>\n<p>We did a lot of these secret society sessions, where we had users come on board and validate the interface we were building. In fact, we have another 30 people coming over and validating the QuickBook version that we are working on.</p>\n<p>In the end, you also don\u2019t want to make it confusing for the user by throwing in a whole lot of new features. Conversions are going up, and some of these features were requested by users.</p>\n<p><strong>What about the experiences section with its curated list? What sort of response has that seen?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AT:</strong> Response is good given that this is a new section. People think of BookMyShow as more of a transacting website, although we do want to increase engagement, and help people discover stuff as well. We\u2019re also seeing that more people are interacting on events, and conversions going up when they are discovering this via the curated fashion. For instance, in experiences we have options like Editor Recommends, and if you click on the events there, then you can directly book tickets as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you say that design is finally being taken seriously in India?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AT:</strong> I think design is extremely important to a product. I\u2019ve had a lot of exposure to different sources of inspiration that made me a designer.</p>\n<p>In India, people are starting to realise that without design your product is not going to do as well as it can, or do its max potential. That doesn\u2019t mean that without design you can\u2019t do business. However, there are some companies that are taking design seriously like Zomato and ClearTrip. A lot of startups are working design-first, and that\u2019s a great thing. But at the same I don\u2019t think a pure design-centric approach is completely there, and it will take time to evolve.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2791972&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/interview-bookmyshows-anish-tripathi-design-revamp-tech-2791972/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bookmyshow_feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bookmyshow_feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">BookMyShow_FEAT</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9fa26a5205a29f2c7954b0779012be5?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shrutidhaps</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/bookmyshow_big_1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">BookMyShow, BookMyShow design revamp, BookMyShow discount, BookMyShow offers, BookMyShow Anish Tripathi, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/bookmyshow_anish_1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">BookMyShow, BookMyShow design revamp, BookMyShow discount, BookMyShow offers, BookMyShow Anish Tripathi, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/bookmyshow_big_2.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">BookMyShow, BookMyShow design revamp, BookMyShow discount, BookMyShow offers, BookMyShow Anish Tripathi, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>BSNL in talks with Reliance Jio, Vodafone for a 2G roaming agreement</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/bsnl-in-talks-with-reliance-jio-vodafone-for-a-2g-roaming-agreement/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/bsnl-in-talks-with-reliance-jio-vodafone-for-a-2g-roaming-agreement/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 16:55:10 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 16:56:45 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2791962</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Once the agreement is finalised, BSNL customers will also have access to the networks of Reliance Jio and Vodafone.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2791962&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2791990 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bsnl-759.jpg\" alt=\"BSNL, Reliance, Vodafone, Relaince Jio, 2G, Internet, Reliance LYF, Reliance 4G SIM, telecom, 3G, smartphones, Internet service, technology, technology news \" /> Once the agreement is finalised, BSNL customers will also have access to the networks of Reliance Jio and Vodafone.\n<p>State-owned BSNL is in advanced talks with Reliance Jio and Vodafone for signing a 2G roaming agreement this month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are in advanced stages for signing 2G intra-circle roaming agreement with Reliance Jio and Vodafone.

In the end, only stability, speed and efficiency were tested, as the plane flew at just 7,000 feet (2,130 meters) for its brief journey.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The airplane is very stable. We got what we called dead beat response, so the way we like it,&#8221; said Payne. Designers, drawing on computerised simulations, plan to\u00a0induce high-frequency vibrations to the wings to see if the glider itself can contain those vibrations at safe levels.</p>\n<p>Ed Warnock, chief executive of the Perlan group, said his team wants to test whether it is possible for the crew to breathe only the air inside the craft without condensation damaging instruments or causing windows to fog up. &#8220;We have to control it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The Perlan 2 project has pulled together top aerospace experts and aviation engineers to develop its space glider.

Recently the app added support for users to share DOCX, DOCS, VCF and PDF files. The ZIP file sharing will prove to be a very useful feature for users as it compresses large files. WhatsApp is also end-to-end encrypted, making chats private for all users.</p>\n<p>For WhatsApp, adding new features is no longer a question of choice, but one of necessity. With over 900 million monthly active users, the app is now as big as its parent company Facebook. Plus the messaging space has evolved drastically in the last one year or so.

The 5.3-inch HD screen is great to look at too. The colours are vivid and the icons appear sharp. Using the phone in bright sunlight, however, is a bit of a task.</p>\n<p>K10 has on-screen navigation buttons, and can be modified to add up to 5 of them on the home screen. We really liked the capture feature, present in the notifications drop-down that enabled us to take quick notes when required.</p>\n<p>K10\u2019s 2,300 mAh battery should easily last you for a day on moderate usage, which is great. The smartphone lasted for more than 15 hours in the battery test.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2790043 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/lg-k10-capture.jpg\" alt=\"LG K10, LG K10 review, LG K10 LTE review, LG K10 price, LG K10 specs, LG K10 features, 4G, 4G smartphone, LG new phone, smartphones, gadgets, technology, technology news\" /> We really liked the capture feature, present in the notifications drop-down that enabled us to take quick notes when required.\n<p>Multi-tasking on LG K10 LTE is pretty decent too, except when you have multiple tabs open, and you are switching between them frequently. In such scenarios, the response time taken to open a tab slowed down. Also, LG K10 cannot handle graphic heavy games well, so we wouldn\u2019t recommend playing for more than just a couple of minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>What is not good?</strong></p>\n<p>The 13 megapixel rear camera in K10 LTE is bit of a let down. It manages to take decent shots in ample light, but we expected more at this price-point. The low-light results are a disappointment, both in terms of picture quality and visibility as they appear grainy.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2790045 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/lg-k10-camera-sample-a.jpg\" alt=\"LG K10, LG K10 review, LG K10 LTE review, LG K10 price, LG K10 specs, LG K10 features, 4G, 4G smartphone, LG new phone, smartphones, gadgets, technology, technology news\" /> The 13 megapixel rear camera in K10 LTE is bit of a let down.

(Image resized for web)\n<p>The five megapixel front camera shots weren\u2019t sharp either. The colour reproduction isn\u2019t good and the pictures, again appear grainy. Also, it doesn\u2019t come with a lot of tweaks except for Gesture shot, which allows a user to take four selfies in a row, and rely on voice control to click pictures.</p>\n<p>The smartphone runs Android 5.1 Lollipop out-of-the box, and thus K10 doesn\u2019t really make for a great option right now. The company hasn\u2019t promised Android Marshmallow for these devices yet.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>If you are not a LG user, be ready to get used to controlling volume and unlocking the phone from buttons on the back, instead of sides. It took me some time to realise that the power and volume buttons aren\u2019t on the side in my new smartphone anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>\n<p>LG K10 LTE, faces tough competition from players like <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/xiaomi/\">Xiaomi</a> and LeEco. Smartphones like Redmi Note 3, Le 1s and Coolpad Note 3 Lite offer better specs, including fingerprint scanner; and great camera and processor under Rs 15,000.</p>\n<p>Go for LG K10, if you want a stylish phone, and that is pretty much all that you care about.</p>\n<p><strong>Read:<a

India, Google Maps India offline, Google Maps Direction, Google, Google India, Google Maps Licence, Maps Licence, Google Maps license, technology, technology news\" /> <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> Maps has become more India focussed with support for Hindi, turn-by-turn directions in the same language as well as offline support.\n<p>Remember the last time you rolled down the window of your car, and asked for directions? Well, I can\u2019t. If you still do bother a poor auto-rickshaw driver or pan vendor on the roadside, then you are just not abreast with the times. For one of the biggest technological advancements of our times has been real-time maps on our handsets, and how we use them to plan everything from travel times to what to do at a destination. Many of us are no longer completely lost in foreign lands, because we have recced where we are going, and done a Streetview tour of the location even before landing there.</p>\n<p>While Google Maps has been around for over a decade, it is only in the past year or so that it started becoming more India-focussed. It now understands Hindi and offers turn-by-turn directions in the same language. And it has a very Indian voice and accent that no longer pronounces <em>Marg</em> as marge. All this has helped make Google Maps accessible to a wider audience, given that most Indians have the facility on their phones already, thanks to the grip Android has on our smartphone market.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/india-map-100-crore-fine-7-years-jail-2786257/\" target=\"_blank\">Up to Rs 100 cr fine, 7 yrs in jail for wrong depiction of India map</a></strong></p>\n<p>Sanket Gupta (Product Manager, Google Maps) says India is a focus area for Google and maps is no different. \u201cIn the last ten years, we have made a lot of progress. Maps are ever changing and our vision is to create comprehensive, accurate and reliable maps for everyone across the world,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-nominates-six-indian-start-ups-for-its-launchpad-accelerator-program-2798437/\">Google nominates six Indian start-ups for its &#039;Launchpad Accelerator&#039; program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/\">Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-tap-to-translate-will-work-across-android-app-how-to-use-2796516/\">Google Tap to Translate will now work inside any app on Android: Here&#039;s how</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/\">Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-free-wifi-launched-for-ujjain-jaipur-patna-guwahati-allahabad-stations-2793095/\">Google free WiFi arrives at Ujjain, Jaipur, Patna, Guwahati and Allahabad stations</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>However, India is tricky given that we don\u2019t have a great map culture. Even when new technologies like satellite maps came in, we were not that fast to open up. There are still dark spots in most satellite maps of India, and we have not yet given permission for Google StreetView.</p>\n<p>But there are challenges even from a cartographic point of view. \u201cIn India we use landmark based directions as not all streets have names, and there is also a lack of signboards. In the absence of signboards, Google Maps offers these local landmarks for users to understand where they are,\u201d says Gupta, adding that this feature has since been adopted in other parts of the world too.</p>\n<p>If you see a lot of taxi drivers now use a smartphone to reach you or find a destination which they might not be otherwise familiar with, that is because Google Maps has been able to breach the language barrier with Hindi voice search. \u201cNot everyone speaks in English, and that is why we have voice search as well as directions in Hindi,\u201d Gupta adds.</p>\n<p><strong>Also see: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-maps-updated-to-give-traffic-jam-alerts-suggest-best-routes/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Maps will now give traffic jam alerts and suggest best routes</a></strong></p>\n<p>Another feature that works for an Indian audience is offline maps with turn-by-turn directions, given that our networks are not really dependable, especially when you are on the move. Maps on apps, have also taken their toll on standalone navigation devices, which are slowly losing ground.</p>\n<p>It is not unusual these days for someone to tell you that it is better to take a longer route as the shortest one is all jammed up. That is because Google Maps now offers traffic alerts with the red bands signifying that vehicles are moving at a crawl, which is almost always in cities like Delhi and Bangalore. However, this feature along with estimated time of arrival, lets you take informed decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-maps-offline-with-turn-by-turn-directions-now-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Maps Offline with turn-by-turn directions now available in India</a> </strong></p>\n<p>Interestingly, this data is collated by Google based on how fast somebody who is using the maps app or location data in the stretch, which is moving. So for every person who avoids a jam, there are many who are already stuck and helping you avoid the clogged route.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Google Maps is not limited to Android devices and can be used on iOS phones too. For the dwindling tribe of Windows Phone users, there <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/most-popular/apps/mobile?cat1=navigation%20--%20maps\">are third party apps that offers similar features</a>, but not the real thing. Thankfully, Bing Maps does a decent job, or you could opt for <a href=\"http://www.waze.com/\">Waze</a> which is one of the better options for users across platforms.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\">Watch all our tech videos </a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Apple Maps has become better for Indian users of late, but still does not have the kind of rich data it offers in US or even China. For instance, there are street names, but no establishments are mapped in my locality. But with Apple slowly turning its focus on India, we can be rest assured that they too will offer much more in terms of map data. It will now be tough for Indians to get lost on the road.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

Here&#8217;s our review.\n<p>With our busy lifestyles, the only time most of us get to listen to music is when we are working out or in the gym. This is why earphones meant to be used when you active, are becoming better with their audio quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Brainwavz Xfit XF200</strong></p>\n<p>Though relatively unknown in India, Brainwavz has been pushing quite a few new products here of late. Their latest is the Brainwavz Xfit XF200, which as the name suggests are fitness oriented earphones.</p>\n<p><strong>Specs: </strong>Drivers: Dynamic, 9 mm | Rated Impedance: 16 ohms | Frequency Range: 20 Hz ~ 20 kHz| Sensitivity: 95 dB at 1 mW |Rated Input Power: 10 mW |Cable: 1.4 m Y-Cord, Copper | Plug: 3.5 mm, Gold plated</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Rs 1699</p>\n<p>The Xfit XF200 gives you a good fit, and stays in place whatever you are doing. This is thanks to a flexible grip that goes behind your ear lobes to give it a spectacle-like grip &#8212; a very common design for fitness earphones these days.</p>\n<p>Xfit XF200 also comes with a microphone and remote in the right hand chord, above the Y. I personally like the remote on the Y, but the idea here is to keep the microphone near your mouth. So it offers good clarity for people who are tying to hear you on the other side of a call, even if you are on the sweaty side of a jog.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2789808\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/brainwavz_audio_1.jpg\" alt=\"Brainwavz Xfit XF200, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 earphones, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 earphone, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 review, Brainwavz earphones, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 specs, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 price, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 features, technology, technology news\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>I was impressed by the audio quality of these earphones, especially because there is no bass boost here. The audio quality is crisp, yet rich, and I enjoyed listening to everything from Ghazals to country numbers by the <em>Zac Brown Band</em>.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the XF200 worked well even for the kind of music I like to listen to when I am not on a jog. It worked well even for Yo-Yo Ma, which usually tries to intimidate your auditory senses with a wide array of sounds. You can try lounging with these earphones once you are done jogging.</p>\n<p>Usually fitness earphones are too flashy for my taste, not this one. Also these handle sweat and moisture pretty well, without adding a layer of aquatic effects to the music.</p>\n<p><strong>Should you buy?</strong></p>\n<p>Brainwavz Xfit XF200 seems like a pretty good option for the most active among us. At Rs 1699, it costs just a fraction of the top end brand, but is not short on features in anyway.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2789776&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/brainwavz-xfit-xf200-review-specs-features-price-2789776/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/brainwavz_audio_feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/brainwavz_audio_feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">BrainWavz_Audio_FEAT</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9fa26a5205a29f2c7954b0779012be5?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shrutidhaps</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/brainwavz_audio_2.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Brainwavz Xfit XF200, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 earphones, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 earphone, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 review, Brainwavz earphones, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 specs, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 price, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 features, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/brainwavz_audio_1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Brainwavz Xfit XF200, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 earphones, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 earphone, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 review, Brainwavz earphones, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 specs, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 price, Brainwavz Xfit XF200 features, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Facebook: A platform with little less sharing of personal information</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/eye-2016-facebook-social-personal-information-digital-friendship-2789325/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/eye-2016-facebook-social-personal-information-digital-friendship-2789325/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 04:00:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 04:00:35 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nishant Shah]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Social]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2789325</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[As Facebook becomes less personal, what happens to digital friendship?<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2789325&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/facebook-ap-image-big2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2789335\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/facebook-ap-image-big2.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook, social networking, digital friendship, Facebook personal information, Facebook Live, Facebook news, social news, tech news, technology\" /></a> <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/facebook/\">Facebook</a> is not really a friendship platform. It is a company interested in selling our interactions and data to advertisers\n<p>Facebook is worried. Even though usage is growing, something strange is happening on the social network. For the first time since it started its journey as a website to rate datable people on college campuses, to becoming the global reference point that defined friendship in the connected age, people are sharing less personal information on Facebook. For a social media network that positions itself largely as a space where our everyday, banal doings become newsworthy articulations, this is surprising news. But it is true. On Facebook, the traffic is high, but most of it is now sharing of external information. People are sharing links to news, to listicles, to videos, to blogs entries, to pictures and to information that they find interesting, but they are writing less and less about what it is that they are doing and feeling.</p>\n<p>Ironically, this coincides with the latest change in Facebook\u2019s \u201cresponse\u201d options, where the ubiquitous \u201cLike\u201d button can now expand to other emojis where you can also be appropriately angry, sad, surprised, or happy about the shared content. Even as Facebook is trying to get its users to qualify how they feel and give emotional value to their likes, people seem to be sharing even less of their private lives on Facebook.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/facebook-trending-topics-controversy-2798159/\">Explained: Facebook Trending Topics and the controversy around it</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/facebook-conducting-full-investigation-into-trending-news-bias-reports-mark-zuckerberg/\">Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook conducting full investigation into Trending news bias reports</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/us-senate-questions-facebook-over-hiding-links-to-conservative-stories-2794628/\">US Senate questions Facebook over hiding links to conservative stories</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/facebook-at-work-india-julien-codorniou-announcement-things-to-know-2793829/\">Facebook at Work: Where social network gets serious about enterprise</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/videos/technology-video/facebook-at-work-julien-codorniou-explains/\">Facebook At Work: Julien Codorniou Explains</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>One of the key ways of understanding this drop in people sharing their personal information is through the concept of \u201ccontext collapse\u201d. It has been a concern since the first instances of disembodied digital communication. In our everyday life, we make sense of information based on the different contexts that surround us. The person who authors the information, the setting within which that information reaches us, the emotional state that we are in when encountering the information, our sense of where we are when processing it, and the preparedness we have for receiving this information are all crucial parameters by which we make sense of the meaning of the information and also our response to it.</p>\n<p>In the case of Facebook, the context within which information and transactions have made sense is \u201cfriendship\u201d. The site&#8217;s USP was that you could bring in a variety of information, but you were always sharing it with friends. You could have a large audience, but this audience is formed of people you know, people you trust, people you add to your friend groups \u2014 there is a sense of intimacy, privacy, and casualness that marks the flow of information. You are able to talk, in an equal breath, about what you had for breakfast, your crush on a celebrity, your random acts of charity, and your strong political rant, one after the other, without requiring to think about what you are posting and how others will receive it.</p>\n<p>However, Facebook is not really a friendship platform. It is a company interested in selling our interactions and data to advertisers who can target us with content and information based on the patterns of our behaviour. To serve its advertisers better, Facebook started privileging \u201cverified\u201d information trying to ensure news and content producers higher attention and more eyeballs. This was further strengthened by their continued integration with third party vendors, who could push and pull information into the social world of Facebook, and is seen as one of the biggest reasons for this drop. Any newsfeed in the last few months has had equal amounts of professional and amateur content, leading to a context collapse, where you no longer feel like your Facebook feed is a private and intimate conversation with friends.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Facebook\u2019s expansive integration of its products \u2014WhatsApp chats, Instagram updates, and Tumblr posts all can collapse into one \u2014 produced a confusing space where the personal information that you were once happy to share with your friends, is suddenly being shared along with news and information. Also, digital behaviour works on mirroring, and we often shape our updates to match what we see on our timelines. If we more and more see external content rather than personal statuses, we also start sharing more third party news and links, thus producing a domino effect of everybody shying away from extremely personal or intimate moments.</p>\n<p>Facebook, for the millennials, has been the context within which friendship got structured. Its own transitions have now collapsed that context, leading people to think of it as a content aggregator. It is going to be interesting to see what happens to our digital friendships and networks if Facebook is no longer the space where they are housed.</p>\n<p><em>Nishant Shah is a professor of new media and the co-founder of The Centre for Internet &amp; Society, Bangalore.</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2789325&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/eye-2016-facebook-social-personal-information-digital-friendship-2789325/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/facebook-ap-image-small2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/facebook-ap-image-small2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Facebook-AP-image-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/facebook-ap-image-big2.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Facebook, social networking, digital friendship, Facebook personal information, Facebook Live, Facebook news, social news, tech news, technology</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Atomic Force Microscopes get a technology boost</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/atomic-force-microscopes-get-a-technology-boost-2789571/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/atomic-force-microscopes-get-a-technology-boost-2789571/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 01:17:31 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 01:17:31 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2789571</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Developing a method to replace the needle in Atomic Force Microscopes, used to observe nano-sized particles, without changing the spring in the structure.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2789571&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2789575\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/atomic_force_microscope-759.jpg\" alt=\"Atomic Force Microscopes, AFM science, atomic microscope, science news, world news, latest news, physics news\" width=\"759\" height=\"422\" /></p>\n<p><strong>R Sri Muthu Mrinalini &amp; G R Jayanth</strong> |\u00a0IISc, Bangalore</p>\n<p>As more uses are found for nano-sized particles, there is an increasing need to \u2018see\u2019 and \u2018feel\u2019 them in order to understand their properties and behaviour better. For decades, electron microscopes have been used to observe atomic-sized particles. These days, however, Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) are gaining popularity as they have certain advantages over the electron microscope.</p>\n<p>Unlike electron microscopes that send electron beams to \u2018illuminate\u2019 the object under observation, and thus \u2018see\u2019 it, AFMs use a very sharp needle, with dimensions of the order of a few nanometres, to \u2018feel\u2019 the object and develop its geometry. AFM takes a blind man\u2019s approach to sense the shape of an object, touching and feeling it with fingers (needle) to understand what it looks like. Only, it does it with a lot more precision. Human fingers would be unable to get around all the curves and crevices of every object, but the AFM\u2019s needle can. By sensing the variations in the mechanical forces during its interaction with the object, and subsequently controlling the force, it is able to very accurately \u2018see\u2019 how the small particles look like and what exactly their structure is.</p>\n<p>AFMs have another big advantage over electron microscopes. They do not necessarily require vacuum conditions to operate. AFMs can work in air as well as in liquid medium.</p>\n<p>But AFMs have a problem in their needles. Their tip is very sharp and it gets blunted or broken very frequently, and needs to be changed. The way AFMs are currently built, replacement of the tip is not a very smooth process. The tip is attached to a spring-like structure that has integrated sensors to measure the mechanical forces. Right now, replacing the tip means replacement of the needle as well as the spring. It is done manually and one needs to wait for about half-an-hour after the replacement, to resume operation. In industrial set-ups, this is a big hassle.</p>\n<p>New instruments have emerged in the market that allow automatic replacement of needles. But for industries that have been using older AFMs, buying entirely new instruments can be a costly affair.</p>\n<p>It is in this area that our work can have some significance. We have developed a method to replace the needle without changing the spring. More importantly, existing AFMs can be retrofitted with this technology, so buying new instruments won\u2019t be necessary. This alone can potentially bring down the cost of automatic replacement by a factor of 100.</p>\n<p>What we have done is to introduce a micro-gripper between the spring and the needle. This micro-gripper is actually a tiny liquid droplet. It is about a few picolitres (10 -12 litres) in volume. It acts like an adhesive to which the needles can get attached. A liquid droplet might not seem to be an ideal adhesive to hold anything firmly in place, but the relative magnitudes of forces operating at the micro-scale are very different from what we experience. At that scale, the surface tension of the liquid is very strong and good enough to hold the needle.</p>\n<p>We have also developed a mechanism for detaching the needle from the micro-gripper without disturbing any other part of the instrument. This ability to attach and detach the needle to and from the micro-gripper presents an effective way of replacing the needle without needing to change the spring.</p>\n<p>We are not the first ones to attempt replacement of needles in the AFM without disturbing its other parts. But we are the only ones to have shown that it can be done in ambient conditions \u2014 others have been able to achieve this only in vacuum \u2014 and can also be retrofitted to older instruments. The replacement process is still manual and we are currently working on its automation.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2789571&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/atomic-force-microscopes-get-a-technology-boost-2789571/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/atomic_force_microscope-480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/atomic_force_microscope-480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Atomic_force_microscope-480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/435232d9d6e68bceac465179e73e0dbf?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kris1290</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/atomic_force_microscope-759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Atomic Force Microscopes, AFM science, atomic microscope, science news, world news, latest news, physics news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Science in 140 characters: What scientists are tweeting about</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/science-in-140-characters-what-scientists-are-tweeting-about-elon-musk-spacex-2789568/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/science-in-140-characters-what-scientists-are-tweeting-about-elon-musk-spacex-2789568/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 01:01:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 01:01:15 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jamie Mullick]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2789568</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Very few private enterprises have caught the eye of scientists as well as normal people the way that SpaceX has.

SpaceX has been setting the bar higher and higher for all of space travel. Entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s foray into space had Twitter abuzz past week over its night launch (and subsequent landing) of a rocket on their drone ship, intact, in the middle of the ocean. NASA\u2019s Curiosity Rover\u2019s imaging chief Emily Lakdawalla was one of the many scientists excited about the second landing in human history on a drone ship: \u201cHoly cow! They did it again, this time at night! Well done, @SpaceX!!!\u201d The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was launched at 1.21 EST from SpaceX\u2019s launch site at Cape Canaveral, Florida, into space, carrying with it the Japanese telecommunications satellite JCSAT-14. This mission was particularly difficult because the satellite needed a very high orbit, so the Falcon 9 was forced to travel at twice its speed. The previous successful landing was on April 8, the first time in history that a rocket landed safely on a remote-controlled platform in the middle of the ocean. This was their fourth launch this year.</p>\n<p><strong>Fighting paranoia with VR</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vaughan Bell, Psychiatrist</strong>\u00a0| <em>@vaughanbell</em></p>\n<p>Of late, Virtual Reality (VR) headsets have been one of the most in-demand devices in the gaming industry. However, researchers at Oxford University have found that these VR headsets can be used for treatment of psychiatric conditions like severe paranoia, according to an article tweeted by cognitive scientist Vaughan Bell. For their research, that was published in The British Journal of Psychiatry, the Oxford team designed an entire coach of a subway train in augmented reality in which they placed several people. Around 30 patients suffering from severe paranoia were then \u201cput inside\u201d this coach using VR headsets. Some patients were then told to confront their fears and \u201clower their defences and try to learn they were safe by approaching computer characters and standing toe-to-toe or staring at them,\u201d the article says. After a day of testing in the augmented coach, it was found that more than half of the patients who confronted their fears were no longer suffering from severe paranoia. \u201cAt the heart of paranoia is the unfounded belief that people aren\u2019t safe&#8230; With VR we can help the person re-learn that they are safe, and when they do that, the paranoia melts away,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author and clinical psychologist Daniel Freeman said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2789568&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/science-in-140-characters-what-scientists-are-tweeting-about-elon-musk-spacex-2789568/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/spacex-droneship-landing-feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/spacex-droneship-landing-feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">spaceX-droneship-landing-feat</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/435232d9d6e68bceac465179e73e0dbf?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">kris1290</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/spacex-droneship-landing-main.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Elon Musk, elon musk spacex, spacex mission, elon musk spacex mission, virtual reality, vr headsets, virtual reality headsets, science news, latest news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>NASA detects atomic oxygen in martian atmosphere</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/nasa-sofia-atomic-oxygen-detected-in-martian-atmosphere-2789045/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/nasa-sofia-atomic-oxygen-detected-in-martian-atmosphere-2789045/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 17:01:30 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 20:25:44 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2789045</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Atomic oxygen in the Martian atmosphere is notoriously difficult to measure<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2789045&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/sofia-mars-nasa-big.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2789065\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/sofia-mars-nasa-big.jpg\" alt=\"NASA, Mars, SOFIA, SOFIA Boeing jetliner, SOFIA observatory, GREAT, NASA mars mission, space, space news, tech news, technology\" /></a> Scientists have detected atomic oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars (Source: NASA)\n<p>Scientists have detected atomic oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars for the first time since the last observation 40 years ago.</p>\n<p>These atoms were found in the upper layers of the Martian\u00a0atmosphere known as the mesosphere.</p>\n<p>Atomic oxygen affects how other gases escape Mars and therefore has a significant impact on the planet&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>\n<p>An instrument onboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) detected only about half the amount of oxygen expected, which may be due to variations in the Martian atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Scientists will continue to use SOFIA to study these variations to help better understand the atmosphere of the Red Planet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Atomic oxygen in the Martian atmosphere is notoriously difficult to measure,&#8221; said Pamela Marcum, SOFIA project scientist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To observe the far-infrared wavelengths needed to detect atomic oxygen, researchers must be above the majority of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and use highly sensitive instruments, in this case a spectrometer. SOFIA provides both capabilities,&#8221; Marcum said.</p>\n<p>The Viking and Mariner missions of the 1970s made the last measurements of atomic oxygen in the Martian atmosphere.</p>\n<p>These more recent observations were possible due to SOFIA&#8217;s airborne location, flying between 37,000-45,000 feet, above most of the infrared-blocking moisture in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The advanced detectors on one of the observatory&#8217;s instruments, the German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz Frequencies (GREAT), enabled astronomers to distinguish the oxygen in the Martian atmosphere from oxygen in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>\n<p>SOFIA is a Boeing 747SP jetliner modified to carry a 100-inch diameter telescope.

email accounts was vulnerable while denying that tens of millions of other users were at risk after researchers found its data circulating among cyber criminals.</p>\n<p>The company said in a statement credentials tied to its email accounts appeared to have been stolen from other, unrelated sites such as social networks or e-commmerce sites that ask users to sign up using email addresses like Mail.ru and pick passwords, which most often will not be the same as those for the email accounts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The database is most likely a compilation of a few old data dumps collected by hacking web services where people used their email address to register,&#8221; the Moscow-based company said.</p>\n<p>However, the security expert who uncovered what he said were hundreds of millions of hacked usernames and passwords into some of the world&#8217;s biggest websites, said Mail.ru&#8217;s own analysis suggested that tens of thousands of users were at risk.</p>\n<p><strong>Read\u00a0More:\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/big-data-breaches-found-at-major-email-services-report/\">Big data breaches found at major email services:\u00a0Report</a></strong></p>\n<p>Alex Holden, founder of Hold Security, a U.S. firm that specialises in recovering stolen credentials from hackers, told Reuters on Wednesday his researchers had coaxed a young Russian hacker into disclosing the stolen data.</p>\n<p>Reuters reported on Wednesday Hold Security&#8217;s discovery of 272.3 million stolen credentials globally, including 57 million at Mail.ru and smaller fractions of the email user bases of <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a>, Yahoo and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>. Mail.ru recently reported 64 million monthly active email users.</p>\n<p>In a statement, the Moscow-based company said its own study of sample data provided by Holden had found that 99.982 percent of Mail.ru account credentials on the hit list were invalid. Most had incorrect passwords or used fake email addresses.</p>\n<p>But the company acknowledged that 0.018 percent of the usernames and passwords might have worked and said: &#8220;We have already notified the affected users to change their passwords.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A Yahoo spokesperson said the company had obtained a sample of Hold Security&#8217;s data and does not believe &#8220;there is any significant risk to our users based on the claims shared with the press.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thefts of personal information or financial losses can result from hackers breaking into other accounts relying on the same credentials.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Mail.ru said it found that 12.42 percent of the sampling had been marked by its computers as suspicious and blocked.</p>\n<p>Holden said he had supplied a randomised sample of data that represents less than one-tenth of the exposed Mail.ru records. He said he was ready to provide Mail.ru the full dataset.</p>\n<p>Hackers know users cling to favourite passwords. It is why attackers reuse old passwords found on one account to try to break into other accounts of the same user.</p>\n<p>Mail.ru said its experts constantly monitor the web for data dumps to see if Mail.ru account credentials are compromised. It said the &#8220;sole purpose&#8221; of revealing the possible credential theft was to create media hype and to promote Holden&#8217;s business.</p>\n<p>Holden, whose firm earns commissions from providing threat intelligence to big companies, said he had spent the past week informing any company whose credentials appeared to have been stolen and was doing it for free.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have no claim to this information because we just retrieved it from the hacker and are sharing it with the community,&#8221; he said. Hold Security refuses to publish the database of stolen accounts but said it provides specific data to authorised technical staff at the affected firms.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2788618&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/mail-ru-denies-mass-password-breach-researcher-stands-by-findings-2788618/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/data-security-thinkstock-feat1.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/data-security-thinkstock-feat1.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Data-security-thinkstock-feat</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/data-security-thinkstock-main1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Russia&#039;s mail.ru denies tens of millions of users were at risk after researchers found its data circulating among cyber criminals (Source: Thinkstock Images)</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Transit of Mercury: Planet to appear as a black dot on the sun</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/mercury-dot-solar-disc-sun-earth-space-2788736/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/mercury-dot-solar-disc-sun-earth-space-2788736/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 13:01:37 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 16:19:10 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2788736</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The planet will be seen as a small black dot travelling from one limb of the solar disc to the other as the Sun, Mercury and the Earth will be lined up in one plane. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2788736&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/mercury-solar-dot-big.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2788757 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/mercury-solar-dot-big.jpg\" alt=\"Transit of Mercury, Mercury transit, Mercury transit timing, Mercury planet on Sun, planet mercury solar dot, space, science, tech news, technology\" /></a> Mercury will be seen as a small black dot travelling from one limb of the solar disc to the other, which is a rare event.

Icahn said in the interview with CNBC last week.</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s refusal to cooperate with the U.S. authorities to provide source code to help them crack open the iPhone that was linked to a mass shooting in San Bernardino also has raised skepticism among some Chinese officials.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>In China, Apple has been asked by authorities in the last two years to hand over its source code but the company refused, according to Apple&#8217;s top lawyer.</p>\n<p>Despite growing concerns over its China business &#8211;

It is a camera system that can accurately reconstruct the three-dimensional scene, using a depth sensor, and track multiple targets and detect abnormalities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;DeepGlint wants to enable computers to understand the world the way it is,&#8221; says He.</p>\n<p>The 3D computer vision gives DeepGlint an edge over other surveillance systems using 2D vision as it doesn&#8217;t rely on the change of pixels inside the mapped area like the latter; thus avoiding false alarms even if someone simply moves around an restricted area and not enter the zone.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2787621 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/entrance.jpg\" alt=\"Entrance\" /> Two imperial guardian lions stand guard outside DeepGlint.\n<p>Banks in China have already begun using DeepGlint&#8217;s HBAS cameras to protect their ATM machines and customers from theft. Their cameras can track abnormal behaviour &#8212; running away from a cash machine or lingering for too long &#8212; and alert the authorities by sounding an alarm. The same technology can be applied inside airports after a few minor tweaks. The system can cast a wider net to detect those leaving their baggage unattended and people trying to evade security checks. The HBAS can also differentiate between inanimate, but moving, objects such as a wheelchair and a live person.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://People Detection at Train Station\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH: How HBAS tracks people inside a train station</a></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNC3yzxfp74&amp;w=759&amp;h=422]\n<p>&#8220;Haomu Behavior Analysis System (HBAS) behaves similar to Microsoft&#8217;s Kinect. It can read and understand people&#8217;s actions like any motion gaming system,&#8221; says He.</p>\n<p>DeepGlint are currently in talks with Tianamen Square municipality, whose cameras generate 1,800 TB of video recordings, to arm them with their technology.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you burn the 1,800TB video files on to DVDs, the pile will be taller than the Eiffel Tower,&#8221; says He.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it will be difficult to go through hundreds and hundreds of hours of recordings to pin-point when exactly a crime was committed in the area.</p>\n<p>Each camera, however, could cost as much as $2000 and using fifty thousand of them at an airport would leave a huge bill. But would you place a price on security post the Brussels airport bombing?</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2787610&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/deep-glint-3d-computer-vision-surveillance-cameras-artificial-intelligence-2787610/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/hbas-cam2.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/hbas-cam2.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">HBAS cam2</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/31f74b2d3d7429f729cd6f6a716b5b60?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">leelaprasad11</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/entrance.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Entrance</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Reliance Jio 4G-ready SIM via employee referral: Here&#8217;s how it works</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/reliance-jio-4g-sim-how-to-buy-2787577/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/reliance-jio-4g-sim-how-to-buy-2787577/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 15:58:19 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 09:22:19 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2787577</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[If you are thinking of simply walking into a store and buying a Reliance Jio 4G-ready SIM, read this before you do <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2787577&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2787586 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/reliancejio_launch_big.jpg\" alt=\" Reliance Jio, Rjio, Reliance, how to get a reliance jio SIM, get reliance jio 4G SIM, reliance jio connection, reliance jio 4g, reliance 4g handsets, reliance LYF, reliance jio LYF, reliance 4g speeds, reliance 4g cost, reliance news, india news\" /> If you are thinking of simply walking into a store and buying a Reliance <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/4g/\">4G</a> SIM, read this before you do.\n<p>Reliance Jio finally expanded its 4G services beyond employees, with offers like unlimited 4G mobile Internet, free phone calls for 90 days and unlimited access to Jio&#8217;s apps but there is a catch.</p>\n<p>But if you are thinking of simply walking into a store and buying a Reliance 4G SIM, read this before you do:</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Beg, plead or intimidate a Reliance employee (just kidding)</strong></p>\n<p>While the Reliance Jio 4G offer does seem tempting, it won&#8217;t be easy to get the connection without catching hold of a Reliance employee. Yes, you heard it right. Only a Reliance employee can get you one and they have the power to invite up to 10 people to start using 4G SIMs.</p>\n<p><strong>Must Read:\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/reliance-lyf-earth1-review-specs-price-features/\" target=\"_blank\">Reliance LYF Earth1 #ExpressReview: Nice design but the camera fails to impress</a></strong></p>\n<p>Now, do everything in your capacity to convince a Reliance employee you deserve that SIM.

If you were thinking of using the blazing 4G speeds on your new <a href=\"http://techie.indianexpress.com/apple-iphone-6s-plus/ie5997303\">Apple iPhone 6s Plus</a> then forget it. Reliance is indirectly saying that their 4G SIM will have no life without their LYF handsets.

All you need to do now is to activate the SIM.</p>\n<p>The referral procedure has already started, and users interested will get a mail confirming the same. They will then have to go to a Reliance Retail to buy their LYF handsets, where they will get a 4G ready SIM along with the device.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>But remember, the company has launched the referral offer on a trial-basis and the SIMs come with a validity of three months.

While Motorola had announced <a href=\"http://techie.indianexpress.com/motorola-moto-g-3rd-gen/ie3012761\">Moto G3</a> and Moto G Turbo at two different intervals of time, this time around both devices could launch together.

He wrote in a blog post that he does not &#8220;have the courage&#8221; to publish additional proof, as he promised Wednesday, that he is the elusive creator of the Internet currency.</p>\n<p>Wright&#8217;s initial claims drew widespread skepticism. He said on Wednesday that he would provide verifiable documentation and take additional steps to prove his identity. Instead, he scrubbed his blog clean of past entries and posted a short statement titled &#8220;I&#8217;m Sorry.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wright didn&#8217;t explicitly renounce his claim to have created bitcoin. He merely wrote Thursday that he thought he could &#8220;put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me.&#8221; But as this week&#8217;s events unfolded, he wrote, &#8220;I am not strong enough for this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can only say I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he wrote at the end of the post. &#8220;And goodbye.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The search for Nakamoto has been a parlor game for journalists and online sleuths since he disappeared from online forums in late 2010. Wright claimed to be Nakamoto in interviews with the Economist, BBC, GQ and a few bitcoin insiders in stories published Monday. He bolstered it with technical demonstrations that two of those insiders vouched for, but failed to repeat those proofs in ways that would allow anyone else to verify them.</p>\n<p>Skeptics reacted harshly to the public proof Wright did offer. For instance, he purported to sign a passage from Jean-Paul Sartre with one of Nakamoto&#8217;s private encryption keys. Experts argued he hadn&#8217;t done that at all, and instead had merely republished a snippet from a historical bitcoin transaction signed by the original Nakamoto.</p>\n<p>Other posts Wright made following his revelation came under fire as well. One of his blog posts attacked a 2013 paper that described how the bitcoin system could be gamed by a group of insiders the paper called &#8220;selfish miners.&#8221; Some readers of the post said it showed a fundamental misunderstanding of the risks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sadly, Craig did not get it,&#8221; said Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell University computer science professor who co-authored the original paper. &#8220;It seemed like he failed to understand what the whole attack was about. That completely made me doubt his veracity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some had argued the identity of the founder shouldn&#8217;t matter. Bitcoin&#8217;s code has been updated many times since its founding and a debate over how to cope with a looming capacity problem will be resolved by bitcoin &#8220;miners&#8221; who keep the currency system running, not by the opinion of one person &#8211; even Nakamoto, whoever that might be.</p>\n<p>Still, the accounts associated with Nakamoto control around 1 million bitcoin worth more than $450 million and their sale could disrupt a bitcoin market worth nearly $7 billion today.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2787269&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/bitcoins-self-proclaimed-founder-craig-wright-backtracks-2787269/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bitcoin-craig-wright-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bitcoin-craig-wright-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">bitcoin-craig-wright-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/bitcoin-craig-wright-big.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Craig Wright backtracks on his claim of being Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, writes &#039;I am not strong enough for this&#039; (Source: BBC News via AP)</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>SpaceX successfully lands its Falcon rocket on a floating droneship again</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/spacex-rocket-landing-at-sea-2787227/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/spacex-rocket-landing-at-sea-2787227/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 12:23:38 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 12:25:37 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2787227</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[SpaceX's Falcon rocket has landed on a floating droneship for the second month in a row<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2787227&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/spacex-rocket-landing-big.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2787251\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/spacex-rocket-landing-big.jpg\" alt=\"SpaceX successfully lands its rocket on a floating droneship after satellite launch for the second time (Source: SpaceX/Twitter)\" /></a> SpaceX successfully lands its rocket on a floating droneship after satellite launch for the second time (Source: SpaceX/Twitter)\n<p>SpaceX has done it again.

I have always thought that the Amkette EvoTV, at least the first one, was among the best hardware products to come out of India. And after having bought the first unit, I have tested\u00a0and been impressed by every version that succeeded it. Four years on, I still happily use the first generation device which does a good job making my flat screen really smart.</p>\n<p><strong>Amkette EvoTV 2</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to looks the EvoTV hasn&#8217;t changed much except for a dash of colour on the box. The remote, which was one of the best features of this device, has sure changed, in a way festering its own ambitions of becoming a game controller. It has lost a bit of flourish from the first version but is still very practical and more importantly functional.</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Rs 6449</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong> Cortex A5 1.6GHz process with ARM Mali 450 | 1GB DDR III RAM | 8GB ROM | Optimized Android 4.4 (Kitkat) | 4 USB ports | SD/MMC Slot | 802.11b/g/n | Bluetooth v4.0 | Ethernet | HDMI | Composite A/V | Coaxial | 5V \u2013 2A Power</p>\n<p><strong>What is good?</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike the first EvoTV, the latest version is almost pure Android. So for a new user there is absolutely no learning involved. You will use this like you will use an Android phone or tablet, and all of us are very adept at that.</p>\n<p>Since it is skinned like an Android tablet, it is also very stable. The screens don\u2019t stutter or stall when you swipe, you come back to the home screen in a jiffy from apps and running multiple apps at the same time is not big deal.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2787021 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/amkette-evotv2-ports-big.jpg\" alt=\"Amkette, Amkette EvoTV2, Amkette EvoTV2 review, Amkette EvoTV2 specs, Amkette EvoTV2 price, gadgets, streaming devices, Chromecast, Netflix, hotstar, watch Netflix on TV, watch hotstar on TV, YouTube, tech news, technology\" /> Amkette EvoTV 2 has lost a bit of flourish from the first version but is still very practical and more importantly functional.\n<p>In fact, the overall performance is very stable as well as nimble and you will be able to do pretty much everything on this device. In fact, I downloaded a few episodes of a new TV series directly on the box, which has about 8GB of internal storage, and watched them using the UTorrent app itself. It was a great experience and this is actually cheaper as the box consumes less power than a PC.</p>\n<p>The EvoTV 2, like the earlier ones in the series, is a great entertainment rig. And at the end of the day, that is what I will use this primarily for. So you can watch content from YouTube or an external storage device like before. But you can also stream directly to the box from Netflix or any other OTT app. In fact, I don\u2019t think there is any other such device that has HotStar for instance and this could be a USP to woo a certain demographic.</p>\n<p>The Evo Air Remote is still great, though it does not come with the gaming options. However, it lets you switch off the air features now and just use it as a simple remote with cursors. This has its advantages, though it takes a while to get adjusted to the buttons.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2787023 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/amkette-evotv2-big.jpg\" alt=\"Amkette, Amkette EvoTV2, Amkette EvoTV2 review, Amkette EvoTV2 specs, Amkette EvoTV2 price, gadgets, streaming devices, Chromecast, Netflix, hotstar, watch Netflix on TV, watch hotstar on TV, YouTube, tech news, technology\" /> The Amkette Evo Air Remote is still great, though it does not come with the gaming options.\n<p>You can now use Bluetooth headsets with this device. A great feature when you consider that fact that HotStar will be beaming a lot of late night football matches which others in the house might not be really interested in.</p>\n<p><strong>What is not so great?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a bit difficult to switch between apps, and maybe a swipe through option would be great to cycle between screens.</p>\n<p>On my old EvoTV, I actually use the Swype keyboard with the Air Remote to type really fast &#8212; I have even composed emails on the 42-inch TV. While that might not be a real use case, I doubt if it is a great idea to make the keyboard accessible only with the cursors. It is a painful process searching stuff this way, especially since there is no mic on the remote for voice search like before.</p>\n<p><strong>Should you buy</strong></p>\n<p>Given that there are cheaper streaming devices in the market at the moment, this makes sense only for those who will use the device to its full potential. So buy this if you are hooked to Netflix or HotStar (or any other OTT app) and now watch it using a really cumbersome rig from the phone or directly on the small screen.

While Samsung and Micromax remain the top two players, both are facing trouble.</p>\n<p>In Samsung&#8217;s case, Apple is starting to make inroads in the premium smartphone market segment, and the South-Korean company&#8217;s share in this price-band (US$300 and above) fell from 66 per cent to 41 per cent.\u00a0In contrast numbers show that Apple&#8217;s market share grew to 29 per cent in the same segment, boosted in particular by the price-cuts for the iPhone 5s, which has become the most popular device in India, according to the research firm.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/pc-shipments-at-lowest-point-since-q2-2011-says-canalys/\">PC shipments at lowest point since Q2 2011, says Canalys</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-facebook-mothers-day-website-tribute-print-picture-2791200/\">&#039;MomShotsOniPhone&#039;: Apple and Facebook team up in tribute to Mother&#039;s Day</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apples-tim-cook-to-visit-china-for-government-meetings-2788530/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook to visit China for government meetings: report</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/strong-phone-security-challenge-for-enforcement-agencies-govt-2787928/\">Strong encryption a major challenge for enforcement agencies: Govt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-sap-partnership-aims-to-revolutionise-work-on-iphone-ipad/\">Apple, SAP partnership aims to &#039;revolutionise work&#039; on iPhone, iPad</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>Canalys calls Micromax the biggest loser along with BlackBerry, Sony and LG. Micromax&#8217;s market share fell to 16.7 per cent in Q1 2016, according to the numbers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rise of online channels, the arrival of new international vendors (particularly from China), the move to LTE and the desire for higher-quality devices have all had a big impact. Indian companies have struggled as incoming vendors have been quicker to address these trends. Micromax, in particular, has been through tough times, with key executives leaving. Now the company is aiming to revamp its strategy to incorporate an ecosystem of services around payments and content,&#8221; said Ishan Dutt, Research Analyst at Canalys.</p>\n<p>Micromax recently announced two new flagship devices the Canvas 6 and Canvas 6 Pro along with its e-commerce store.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2785936\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/canalys_1.jpg\" alt=\"Canalys India numbers, Canalys India smartphone growth, Indian smartphone market, Lenovo growth, Micromax numbers, Apple, Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 5s India, iPhone 5s deals, mobiles, technology, technology news\" width=\"700\" height=\"476\" /></p>\n<p>Lenovo is another vendor that grew and saw shipments rise by 63 per cent on a yearly basis. Apple for its part saw overall shipments rise by 56 per cent, even though it remains in eighth place in India, according to Canalys&#8217; numbers.</p>\n<p>But Canalys warns that a lot of this growth for Apple is due to the price-cut for the iPhone 5s. \u00a0&#8220;Apple&#8217;s growth run could be short-lived. The 5s\u2019 success in India has more to do with affordability of a premium brand than a preference for smaller phones, and the move to the more expensive SE will discourage budget buyers. Also, the recent government regulation curbing discounts on smart phones sold by online platforms will affect demand,&#8221; said Canalys Mobility Analyst Wilmer Ang.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read:\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-q2-results-india-comments-china-growth/\" target=\"_blank\">Here\u2019s why India is Apple\u2019s new China</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read more: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/idc-q1-smartphone-growth-falls-top-five-players-samsung-apple-2773954/\" target=\"_blank\">Smartphone growth flat, says IDC; Lenovo and Xiaomi pushed out of top 5</a></strong></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2785867&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/lenovo-apple-growing-fastest-in-india-micromax-falls-sharply-canalys/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/applelogo_feat_1.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/applelogo_feat_1.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">AppleLogo_FEAT_1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9fa26a5205a29f2c7954b0779012be5?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shrutidhaps</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/applelogo_big_1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Canalys India numbers, Canalys India smartphone growth, Indian smartphone market, Lenovo growth, Micromax numbers, Apple, Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 5s India, iPhone 5s deals, mobiles, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/canalys_1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Canalys India numbers, Canalys India smartphone growth, Indian smartphone market, Lenovo growth, Micromax numbers, Apple, Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 5s India, iPhone 5s deals, mobiles, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Ultimate Ears unveils beach and snow proof UE Boom 2 speaker at Rs 15,995</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/ultimate-ears-ue-boom-2-speaker-launch-price-2785854/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/ultimate-ears-ue-boom-2-speaker-launch-price-2785854/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:31:29 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:33:45 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Gadgets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2785854</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[UE Boom 2's speaker is 25 per cent louder and has a longer wireless range of 100-feet<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2785854&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/ue-boom2-big.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2785896\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/ue-boom2-big.jpg\" alt=\"UE Boom 2 is booth waterproof and drop-proof.

It also included tens of millions of credentials for the world&#8217;s three big email providers, Gmail, Microsoft and Yahoo, plus hundreds of thousands of accounts at German and Chinese email providers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This information is potent. It is floating around in the underground and this person has shown he&#8217;s willing to give the data away to people who are nice to him,&#8221; said Holden, the former chief security officer at U.S. brokerage R.W. Baird. &#8220;These credentials can be abused multiple times,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><strong>LESS THAN $1</strong></p>\n<p>Mysteriously, the hacker asked just 50 roubles &#8211; less than $1 &#8211; for the entire trove, but gave up the dataset after Hold researchers agreed to post favourable comments about him in hacker forums, Holden said. He said his company&#8217;s policy is to refuse to pay for stolen data.</p>\n<p>Such large-scale data breaches can be used to engineer further break-ins or phishing attacks by reaching the universe of contacts tied to each compromised account, multiplying the risks of financial theft or reputational damage across the web.</p>\n<p>Hackers know users cling to favourite passwords, resisting admonitions to change credentials regularly and make them more complex. It&#8217;s why attackers reuse old passwords found on one account to try to break into other accounts of the same user.</p>\n<p>After being informed of the potential breach of email credentials, Mail.ru Mail.ru said in a statement emailed to Reuters: &#8220;We are now checking, whether any combinations of usernames/passwords match users&#8217; e-mails and are still active.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As soon as we have enough information we will warn the users who might have been affected,&#8221; Mail.ru said in the email, adding that Mail.ru&#8217;s initial checks found no live combinations of usernames and passwords which match existing emails.</p>\n<p>A Microsoft spokesman said stolen online credentials was an unfortunate reality. &#8220;Microsoft has security measures in place to detect account compromise and requires additional information to verify the account owner and help them regain sole access.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yahoo and Google did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Yahoo Mail credentials numbered 40 million, or 15 percent of the 272 million unique IDs discovered. Meanwhile, 33 million, or 12 percent, were Microsoft Hotmail accounts and 9 percent, or nearly 24 million, were Gmail, according to Holden.</p>\n<p>Thousands of other stolen username/password combinations appear to belong to employees of some of the largest U.S. banking, manufacturing and retail companies, he said.</p>\n<p>Stolen online account credentials are to blame for 22 percent of big data breaches, according to a recent survey of 325 computer professionals by the Cloud Security Alliance.</p>\n<p>In 2014, Holden, a Ukrainian-American who specialises in Eastern European cyber crime threats, uncovered a cache of 1.2 billion unique credentials that marked the world&#8217;s biggest-ever recovery of stolen accounts.</p>\n<p>His firm studies cyber threats playing out in the forums and chatrooms that make up the criminal underground, speaking to hackers in their native languages while developing profiles of individual criminals.</p>\n<p>Holden said efforts to identify the hacker spreading the current trove of data or the source or sources of the stolen accounts would have exposed the investigative methods of his researchers. Because the hacker vacuumed up data from many sources, researchers have dubbed him &#8220;The Collector&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Ten days ago, Milwaukee-based Hold Security began informing organisations affected by the latest data breaches. The company&#8217;s policy is to return data it recovers at little or no cost to firms found to have been breached.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is stolen data, which is not ours to sell,&#8221; said Holden.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2785760&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/big-data-breaches-found-at-major-email-services-report/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/data-security-thinkstock-feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/data-security-thinkstock-feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Data-security-thinkstock-feat</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/data-security-thinkstock-main.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo mail hacked and details traded in Russia&#039;s underworld market (Source: Thinkstock Images)</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Le 1s Eco gets 1,00,000 registrations in the first 24 hours</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/leeco-le-1s-eco-flash-sale-registrations-specs-price-2785718/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/leeco-le-1s-eco-flash-sale-registrations-specs-price-2785718/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 14:07:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 14:07:49 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mobile & Tabs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2785718</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Le 1s Eco is the first device to feature ecosystem based membership program.

But does this budget <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/4g/\">4G</a> device live up to expectations? Here\u2019s our review\n<p>LG\u2019s smartphone market share in India has been in trouble for sometime. While flagships like G4 have been well-received by critics, the company\u2019s other offerings in the budget segment, especially in the Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000 price range, have not exactly set the market on fire.</p>\n<p>Now LG has two new mid-budget smartphones as part of its K series: the K7 and K 10 LTE. LG says both are \u2018Made in India\u2019 smartphones.</p>\n<p>LG K7 LTE is the cheaper smartphone of the two, priced at Rs 9,500. But does this budget 4G device live up to expectations? Here\u2019s our review</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tg3212bzqY\">Watch our video of LG K7 LTE</a>\u00a0</strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tg3212bzqY&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong> 5-inch in-cell display | Qualcomm Snapdragon 1.1 Ghz quad-core processor | 1.5GB RAM + 8GB storage space | Five megapixel rear and front camera | 2,125 mAh battery| Android 5.1 Lollipop OS | dual-SIM with 4G, VoLTE support</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Rs 9500</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2785281 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/lgk7_lte_big1.jpg\" alt=\"LG K7, K7 LTE, K7 LTE review, LG K7 review, LG smartphones, LG cheap phone, LG, LG Electronics, LG K7 LTE, LG K7 LTE specs, LG K7 price, LG K7 features, smartphones for less than Rs10k, technology, technology news\" /> LG K7 LTE\u2019s volume rockers and power button are on the back.\n<p><strong>So what\u2019s good?</strong></p>\n<p>Honestly, the design of the LG K7 LTE is perhaps its biggest plus point. The LG K7 LTE looks pretty good for its price tag. The metal frame on the side and the 2.5D curved arc design means this fits easily in your hands, even though the glossy back is prone to smudges. LG K7 LTE\u2019s volume rockers and power button are on the back, and the lower volume button can be used to take pictures when the camera app is on.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2785282 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/lgk7_lte_big2.jpg\" alt=\"LG K7, K7 LTE, K7 LTE review, LG K7 review, LG smartphones, LG cheap phone, LG, LG Electronics, LG K7 LTE, LG K7 LTE specs, LG K7 price, LG K7 features, smartphones for less than Rs10k, technology, technology news\" /> The metal frame on the side and the 2.5D curved arc design means this fits easily in your hands, even though the glossy back is prone to smudges.\n<p>The back cover of the LG K7 is removable, as is the battery. Both SIM slots are in the back along with the micro-SD slot. The LG K7 LTE supports only nano-SIM so users will need to keep that in mind while buying this device. The microSD slot can be used along with the second SIM.</p>\n<p>In terms of general performance, the K7 LTE is definitely not the fastest one in its price range, but it can handle multi-tasking without too much trouble. Games like Lara Croft run pretty decently, which is more than you can expect given the specs. Browsing the web should not be a problem on this device. However, don\u2019t expect to play high-end graphics games on this one.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2785285 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/lgk7_camerasample1.jpg\" alt=\"LG K7, K7 LTE, K7 LTE review, LG K7 review, LG smartphones, LG cheap phone, LG, LG Electronics, LG K7 LTE, LG K7 LTE specs, LG K7 price, LG K7 features, smartphones for less than Rs10k, technology, technology news\" /> LG K7 LTE Camera Sample. Picture resized for web.\n<p><strong>What\u2019s not good?</strong></p>\n<p>The specs are underwhelming. The 5-inch full wide VGA resolution (480\u00d7854 pixels) display makes you wonder why this phone costs so much.</p>\n<p>The five megapixel front and rear camera are not at all impressive, and there are options in this same price band that offer a much better camera. If this was a Rs 5000 smartphone it would have been okay, but the price makes these specs unacceptable.</p>\n<p>The battery lasts around 8 hours, which is again below expectations. And yes with the device I faced connectivity issues. The phone never showed 3G, and remained on Edge forever even in places where I usually get 3G.</p>\n<p>Plus the 8GB space of which around 4 GB is available for users when they start the smartphone is not enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>\n<p>At this price, the LG K7 LTE is hard to recommend.

Here&#8217;s how it works and what it means. Representational Image. (Source: Reuters)\n<p>Google will on Thursday, formally announce a partnership with Idea Cellular offering operator billing for purchasing apps and other services. This is the first such arrangement in the country, and will in all likelihood be rolled out to other service providers too.</p>\n<p>The advent of operator billing is a big deal. Despite the size of the market, India has traditionally been a low revenue destination for most mobile apps and services. That is because given the low credit card penetration, Indians have been reluctant to pay for these services. While the Apple users do tend to pay a bit given the way the ecosystem is structured, Android users &#8212; close to 90 per cent of the market &#8212; don\u2019t even bother entering their payment details on phone.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-nominates-six-indian-start-ups-for-its-launchpad-accelerator-program-2798437/\">Google nominates six Indian start-ups for its &#039;Launchpad Accelerator&#039; program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/\">Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-tap-to-translate-will-work-across-android-app-how-to-use-2796516/\">Google Tap to Translate will now work inside any app on Android: Here&#039;s how</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/\">Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-free-wifi-launched-for-ujjain-jaipur-patna-guwahati-allahabad-stations-2793095/\">Google free WiFi arrives at Ujjain, Jaipur, Patna, Guwahati and Allahabad stations</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>With operator billing, things will change. Users will be able to buy an app in one click with the amount being added to their monthly bill or being deducted from their prepaid balance. The one-click is important as often in-app purchases are impulse buys, and adding layers to it only reduces the chance of a final transaction taking place. The biggest impact hence is going to be on mobile gaming, music and other content purchases.</p>\n<p>This will also be a huge boost for the internet economy in India. While there are quite a few successful apps in India, none have really been able to monetise their subscriber base within this geography. Now, they will finally have the option of reducing their dependence on the ad-funded model and monetise almost their entire subscriber base. However, just having operator billing will not do, the content will have to be compelling enough to be bought.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\">Watch all our video reviews</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Also, there could be an influx of premium services like Spotify, which were holding on till now due to the lack of a good payment system. Plus, India is likely to be pioneer the micro-payment model for mobile purchases where users would buy a song, or a book or a newspaper article at a nominal rate, instead of buying a more expensive subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Also see: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/beyond-recharges-bills-your-digital-wallet-wants-to-be-present-everywhere/\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile app payments: Paytm to MobiKwik, the digital wallet is expanding</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read more: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/unified-payments-interface-upi-payment-system-faster-easier-and-smoother-2754125/\" target=\"_blank\">Unified Payments Interface system : Faster, easier and smoother </a></strong></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2785173&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-idea-operator-billing-india-how-it-works-2785173/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/googlelogo_feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/googlelogo_feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">GoogleLOGO_FEAT</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9fa26a5205a29f2c7954b0779012be5?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shrutidhaps</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/googlelogo_1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Google, Idea Cellular, Google Idea, Google Idea operator Billing, Google Play operator billing, Google Play Apps, Google Play Paid apps, Paid apps, Google Play Store payment, Idea Cellular, Idea and Google, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>MoCIT on encrypted messaging services: Issues to be taken on case-to-case basis</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/encryption-policy-whatsapp-encryption-policy-encryption-policy-draft-encrypted-services-issues-to-be-taken-up-on-case-to-case-basis-2784901/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/encryption-policy-whatsapp-encryption-policy-encryption-policy-draft-encrypted-services-issues-to-be-taken-up-on-case-to-case-basis-2784901/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 02:23:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 09:07:13 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Pranav Mukul]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2784901</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The government says it will take up the issue of decryption of messages on services like WhatsApp when specific cases require intervention. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2784901&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2780349 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/whatsapp-new1.jpg\" alt=\"WhatsApp, WhatsApp encrytpion, WhatsApp illegal in India, Govt India encryption, Indian govt encryption, Encryption terrorism, Encryption rules in India, India law on encyrption, Encryption India, technology, technology news\" /> Mobile applications such as WhatsApp make use of proprietary authentication protocols to secure messages.\n<p>The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MoCIT) will take up the issue of initiating measures for enabling the decryption of messages on internet services such as WhatsApp and Viber, with the ministries of law and home affairs, as and when specific cases requiring intervention by security agencies arise, two government officials involved in the exercise told <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/\">The Indian Express</a> on condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>The development gains significance in the light of the WhatsApp service being blocked in Brazil on Monday after a state judge ordered the country\u2019s five main wireless operators to block access to the app for 72 hours.

Mobile applications such as WhatsApp make use of proprietary authentication protocols to secure messages. Recently, WhatsApp had introduced end-to-end encryption for all its services, meaning that the messages could only be read by the intended recipients.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, when asked if the government was open to the option of including these services in the policy given that security agencies are unable to decrypt the messages, Minister of Communications and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad said: &#8220;We will look into it&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Also see: <a

Getting a good lens is when the struggle starts as most options from a DSLR brands are costly. This is where a Tamron or a Sigma come into play.</p>\n<p>We recently got our hands on the Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8. Tamron is way cheaper than Canon/Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8, but is Tamron a better alternative? Here\u2019s our Review:</p>\n<p>The body is all-metal, but it looks like an old design. However, the lens grips very well and felt good for the hand-held shots.</p>\n<p>Tamron calls the IS (Image Stabiliser) as VC (vibration compensation), and it comes with an On/Off button unlike the same Canon lens which has IS level 1 and 2.</p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8859.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2784370\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8859.jpg\" alt=\"The image quality is pretty decent and retains great details of the subject\" /></a> The image quality is pretty decent and retains great details of the subject\n<p>This lens features USD (ultrasonic silent drive), and the autofocus is not so fast, but it is good. The USD feature did work well when we tested it on a Canon 6D body. The focusing is fast and silent.</p>\n<p>One unique feature is that the length of the lens remains same even as you zoom. While it is cool, you are in a way waiting for the lens to become longer. The feature helps the lens reduce noise.</p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8900.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2784375\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8900.jpg\" alt=\"Tamron, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens review, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens features, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens price, best lenses, budget lenses, best zoom lenses, best zoom lens for nikon, best zoom lens for canon, tech news, technology\" /></a> The full zoom capability of Tamron is exceptional (Click on the image to see in full resolution)\n<p>On the flip side, the zoom ring is in the front, and focussing ring, behind which is quite annoying for a manual user. I think this is a big flaw in design.</p>\n<p>The Image quality is pretty decent if you look at what we shot:</p>\n<p>As you can see the picture results are quite good. With Focal Range from 70-200 mm and maximum aperture f2.8 to minimum of f32, we shot with various combination of focal lengths and aperture, the results are sharp and colours good. If you want a bokeh, this lens will not disappoint you.</p>\n<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8841.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2784377\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8841.jpg\" alt=\"Tamron, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens review, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens features, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens price, best lenses, budget lenses, best zoom lenses, best zoom lens for nikon, best zoom lens for canon, tech news, technology\" /></a> Tamron won&#8217;t disappoint people looking at shooting bokeh effects\n<p>While the picture quality is good, our testing with a similar Canon lens showed that the latter offered sharper images.</p>\n<p>Overall, I am happy with the image quality this lens gives considering the price range.</p>\n<p>If you are on a budget and looking for a lens as good as brands like Canon or Nikkon, go for this lens. Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens gives almost the same results a Canon 70-200mm f/2.8, but at a more affordable price point. Go for this one if you don\u2019t have too many issues using a compatible lens in your Canon or Nikon DSLR body.</p>\n<p>Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens comes for both Canon, Nikon and Sony mount, and costs around Rs 1,12,000.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2784348&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/tamron-70-200mm-f2-8-lens-review-canon-nikon-sony-price-2784348/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/tamron_feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/tamron_feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Tamron_FEAT</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/tamron_big_1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Tamron, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens review, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens features, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens price, best lenses, budget lenses, best zoom lenses, best zoom lens for nikon, best zoom lens for canon, tech news, technology</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_8859.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">The image quality is pretty decent and retains great details of the subject</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_8900.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Tamron, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens review, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens features, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens price, best lenses, budget lenses, best zoom lenses, best zoom lens for nikon, best zoom lens for canon, tech news, technology</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_8841.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Tamron, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens review, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens features, Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 lens price, best lenses, budget lenses, best zoom lenses, best zoom lens for nikon, best zoom lens for canon, tech news, technology</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Google acquires Indian-origin entrepreneur&#8217;s start-up</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-acquires-start-up-founded-by-indian-origin-entrepreneur-2784295/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-acquires-start-up-founded-by-indian-origin-entrepreneur-2784295/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 17:09:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 20:10:35 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2784295</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Google has acquired a business technology start-up Synergyse founded by an Indian-origin entrepreneur Varun Malhotra. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2784295&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2784331 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/googlelogo_new_big.jpg\" alt=\"Google, Varun Malhotra, Google acquires Synergyse, Synergyse app, Synergyse start-up, Google apps, Google apps tutor, Google apps coach, technology, technology news\" /> Varun Malhotra is the founder and CEO of Toronto-based Synergyse, which was launched in 2013 with an aim to teach users how to use <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> Apps.

Companies across the world are collaborating over new messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Slack and Moxtra. Now, an Indian company in trying to be heard in this space.</p>\n<p>Flock actually started as a messaging tool much before Slack, but only recently decided to refocus on enterprise. \u201cWe are trying to solve the same problem which is communication in enterprise. We feel the communication that happens over emails leads to a loss of efficiency, and the same can be done much better and faster,\u201d says Ninad Raval, director of product and design\u00a0at Flock.</p>\n<p>Raval says the key differentiators are the simple UI and speed. \u201cMessaging on Flock is fluid and people who moved to our app have complemented us,\u201d he says, adding they have even offered customised features for large customers. \u00a0The platform now has over 2,00,000 monthly active users from 19,000 domains.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-nominates-six-indian-start-ups-for-its-launchpad-accelerator-program-2798437/\">Google nominates six Indian start-ups for its &#039;Launchpad Accelerator&#039; program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/\">Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-tap-to-translate-will-work-across-android-app-how-to-use-2796516/\">Google Tap to Translate will now work inside any app on Android: Here&#039;s how</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/\">Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-free-wifi-launched-for-ujjain-jaipur-patna-guwahati-allahabad-stations-2793095/\">Google free WiFi arrives at Ujjain, Jaipur, Patna, Guwahati and Allahabad stations</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>One key differentiator for Flock from a product like Slack is that fact that all users who log in from the same enterprise domain, say indianexpress.com, will be accessible to others from the company. On the other hand, on Slack users have to be invited to a group to be able to start conversations.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn Flock, people automatically get added to team. And there is federation between teams and others in the company are accessible when needed,\u201d Raval explains, adding that psychologically everyone is there.<br />\n\u201cOn other platforms integration with apps is limited, but on Flock the integration is so seamless that they feel like native features and not APIs,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<p>Flock has a freemium model with each paid user billed $3 per month. Slack charges $6.67 per active user per month.</p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, we have a per user billing and teams have the option of upgrading on some users who get to access all the features,\u201d he says, suggesting that there is a significant price advantage in comparison to the competition.

The move could have significant impact in many markets given that Opera is one of the top browsers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We spoke to <strong>Krystian Kolondra</strong>, Opera Software\u2019s Senior Vice President of Products </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">responsible for Opera\u2019s entire consumer products division</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, about the move: </span></p>\n<p><b>What is the thought process behind a native ad blocker?</b></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&#8220;Online ads slow down web browsing. Downloading ads wastes your time, and they make us wait for our content. We wanted websites to load faster. To secure even more speed than traditional ad blockers, we\u2019ve been working on tackling the problem at its root, blocking ads right in the browser. With native code, and a faster process comparing to ad-blocking extensions, we\u2019ve been able to release the built-in ad blocker to give your browsing a serious boost.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Will this be on all opera browsers &#8211; mobile and web?</b></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&#8220;Yes, both Opera Mini and Opera desktop browsers can now enjoy the ad blocking feature. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A native ad blocker is integrated in the stable version of the Opera browser for computers, as well as the Opera Mini browser for Android. Some 60 million people use Opera for computers, while almost 120 million people use Opera Mini for Android on a monthly basis. These users no longer need to install an ad-blocking extension or download an app, to experience faster browsing.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkg-7lM71Vo\"><strong>VIDEO:\u00a0See how to enable ad blocker</strong></a></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkg-7lM71Vo&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p><b>How do you think publishers will react?</b></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&#8220;Publishers need to make money to pay journalists, editors, bloggers, technology development, innovation, and all the other things that live within the publishing house. \u00a0By enabling websites with a business model to earn money, ads are fueling the web. Much of the content billions of people experience online every day is paid for by ad revenue. The more quality content to choose from, the better \u2013 for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The point is: Advertising fuels the internet, allowing for many services to be free for users, and we are not against them. However, more and more people are using ad blockers. In a recent study conducted by </span><a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/ad-blocking-software-has-200-million-users-2016-4-24?r=US&amp;IR=T\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">PageFair/Adobe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, the number of people using ad blockers grew by 41% worldwide between 2014 and 2015, with 98% of those users on computers. According to this research, more than 200 million people have installed ad-blocking tools. Ad blockers are mainstream and growing rapidly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We want the web to be a better place for all users, but at the same time many webpages are significantly slowed down by bloated ads and heavy ad software. That\u2019s why we give users, web developers and publishers a chance to see how much ads and tracking software affects the page-loading time. We think that sharing this knowledge is very important for the web.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We are here to protect our users, and give them the fastest browsing experience.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2783840&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/opera-browsers-native-ad-block-feature-live-2783840/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/opera_mac_adblock_480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/opera_mac_adblock_480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">opera_mac_adblock_480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5729d8ff961d6d7762512c77b73746f9?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">technocratnandu</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/opera_mac_adblock_11.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">opera_mac_adblock_1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Le 1s Eco has free Supertainment package on board: Here&#8217;s all you need to know</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/le-1s-eco-supertainment-package-features-price-cost-2783839/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/le-1s-eco-supertainment-package-features-price-cost-2783839/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 13:37:07 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 13:20:24 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Hansa Verma]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mobile & Tabs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2783839</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[LeEco has launched a new \u2018Supertainment\u2019 package for its smartphones in India along with a new device called Le 1s (Eco). <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2783839&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2783887 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/leeco_le1seco_big_1.jpg\" alt=\"Le 1s Eco, Le 1s Eco features, Le 1s Eco vs Le 1s, LeEco, LeEco new phone, LeTv new Phone, Le 1s Eco Supertainment package, Supertainment package price, LeEco Content, LeEco ecosystem, technology, technology news\" /> LeEco Le 1s Eco comes with a Supertainment package membership part of the device. Here&#8217;s why LeEco is looking at ecosystem rather than just hardware. (Source: Hansa Verma)\n<p>Chinese internet and technology company LeEco has launched a new \u2018Supertainment\u2019 package for its smartphones in India. LeEco wants to get into the entertainment and content side as well, and has tied up with some players in India. Content bundled with hardware is an area that not too many players in India are currently exploring.</p>\n<p>LeEco\u2019s first device with this kind of content bundling is the Le 1s Eco, which has the exact same specs as the Le 1s, but with a big differentiator: the Supertainment package free on board. LeEco has partnered with Eros Now, YuppTv and Hungama music for the content.\u00a0&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be known as just a smartphone company or an entertainment company,&#8221; says Atul Jain, COO, LeEco India.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe call ourselves an ecosystem because content is just as important as the device screen. Thus, we have to enable the content to be seen on the device screen in the right way. If you don\u2019t have cloud storage, content delivery systems (CDN) etc, but you have the device, you will not be able to provide the right experience to users,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHKHyxgY5y0\"><strong>Watch Video LeEco Le 1s Eco With Supertainment Package Launched At Rs 10,899</strong></a><br />\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHKHyxgY5y0&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-nominates-six-indian-start-ups-for-its-launchpad-accelerator-program-2798437/\">Google nominates six Indian start-ups for its &#039;Launchpad Accelerator&#039; program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/\">Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-tap-to-translate-will-work-across-android-app-how-to-use-2796516/\">Google Tap to Translate will now work inside any app on Android: Here&#039;s how</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/\">Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-free-wifi-launched-for-ujjain-jaipur-patna-guwahati-allahabad-stations-2793095/\">Google free WiFi arrives at Ujjain, Jaipur, Patna, Guwahati and Allahabad stations</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>The biggest challenge, however, is to make content run smoothly for users in India who are still on 2G or end up getting 2G-like speeds even on a 3G network.

(Source: AP)\n<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the iPhone 7 will make everyone want to upgrade to the new device. He made the comments on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFdUa_WeTcQ\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC\u2019s Mad Money show, which is hosted by Jim Cramer.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/03/tim-cook-iphone-model-upgrade\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian quotes Apple CEO Tim Cook</a> as saying on the show, &#8220;We have great innovation in the pipeline, like new iPhones that will incent you and other people that have iPhones today to upgrade to new iPhones&#8230;We are going to give you things that you can\u2019t live without&#8230;You will look back and wonder: &#8216;How did I live without this?'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Apple reported its Q2 earnings for the year, and for the first time since 2003 the company&#8217;s revenue has dropped. And the problem lies with a drop in iPhone sales.\u00a0In <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple&#8217;s investor earnings call</a>, Tim Cook had acknowledged that part of the reason for the decline was the low upgrade cycle for iPhone 6s, especially when compared to iPhone 6.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From an upgrade point of view as I mentioned in my comments, we compare favourably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s. We&#8217;re lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that that was an extraordinary cycle that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015,&#8221; <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/3968300-apple-aapl-timothy-donald-cook-q2-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Cook was quoted as saying in the call.</a></p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-nominates-six-indian-start-ups-for-its-launchpad-accelerator-program-2798437/\">Google nominates six Indian start-ups for its &#039;Launchpad Accelerator&#039; program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/\">Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-tap-to-translate-will-work-across-android-app-how-to-use-2796516/\">Google Tap to Translate will now work inside any app on Android: Here&#039;s how</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/\">Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-free-wifi-launched-for-ujjain-jaipur-patna-guwahati-allahabad-stations-2793095/\">Google free WiFi arrives at Ujjain, Jaipur, Patna, Guwahati and Allahabad stations</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>He said they (Apple) were not ready to &#8220;write off&#8221; developed markets adding &#8220;there&#8217;s still really, really good business&#8221; present in these. Cook also said they set a new record in getting Android users switch to iPhone in the first half of the year, and it was their job to continue making phones, which will convince people to go with iOS.</p>\n<p>Apple is expected <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-iphone7-rumours-leaks-photos/\">to launch the iPhone 7 in September,</a> and according to rumours, it will come with <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/apple-iphone-7-pro-rumours-dual-camera-launch-leaks-2774125/\">no headphone jack, possibly a smart-connector, a dual-camera set-up</a> in the iPhone 7 Plus version, and a faster chip. With the iPhone 7, a design change is also expected, though we&#8217;ll have to wait and see how different the new iPhones are compared to the iPhone 6s and 6 series.</p>\n<p><strong>Also see: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-q2-results-india-comments-china-growth/\" target=\"_blank\">Here\u2019s why India is Apple\u2019s new China</a></strong></p>\n<p>For Apple, the upgrade problem is one that they need to solve and quickly. Tim Cook is right when he says that they need to offer something compelling to convince users to buy a new iPhone. With most Apple products, the shelf life is much better, and longer than with Android devices. It also helps that Apple sends out regular iOS updates, even for older phones.</p>\n<p>Plus the difference between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s was not much other than the chip upgrade and 3D Touch, which by itself was not a compelling reason for many to buy the new device.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\">Watch all our video reviews</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>For Apple to bounce back and prove the critics wrong, iPhone 7 will have to offer something spectacular. Given how much Apple depends on the upgrade cycle to boost its sales, the new phone needs to convince iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s users that their device need to be replaced.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-india-sales-grew-56-per-cent-expect-lte-to-boost-growth-tim-cooks-top-india-comments/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Q2 results: Tim Cook\u2019s top five comments on Indian market</a>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Read more: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-iphone7-rumours-leaks-photos/\" target=\"_blank\">All the Apple iPhone 7 rumours in our blog</a> </strong></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2783686&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-ceo-tim-cook-iphone-7-must-have-upgrade-2783686/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/appletimcook_iphone7_feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/appletimcook_iphone7_feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">AppleTimCook_iPhone7_FEAT</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9fa26a5205a29f2c7954b0779012be5?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shrutidhaps</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/appletimcook_iphone7_big1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Apple Tim Cook, Apple CEO, Apple iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Tim Cook, Apple iPhone 7 rumours, Apple, iPhone 7 rumours, iPhone 7 no headphone jack, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Twitter adds new Connect tab, makes it easier to follow accounts</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/twitter-account-connect-tab-follow-accounts-mobile-app-feature2783514/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/twitter-account-connect-tab-follow-accounts-mobile-app-feature2783514/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 10:01:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 10:01:52 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Social]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2783514</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A new Connect tab on Twitter Inc's mobile app makes it easier for people to find accounts to follow. <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2783514&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2783557\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/twitter_connect_1.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter, Twitter Connect, Twitter Connect Tab, Twitter Connect Tab feature, Twitter new feature, Twitter new tab, social media, technology, technology news\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" />A new Connect tab on Twitter Inc&#8217;s mobile app makes it easier for people to find accounts to follow, the social network said on Tuesday as it launched the new feature to attract more users.</p>\n<p>The tab suggests a list of accounts based on those already followed, as well as popular ones in the area, product manager Ricardo Castro said in a blog post on the company&#8217;s website.</p>\n<p>Users can choose to automatically sync their address books to connect with friends and family with the tab, he said.

(Source: Screenshots of the Paytm app)\n<p>Mobile payment service Paytm says its payment bank will launch by August, and that the Noida-based company is currently in the middle of submitting its final proposal to the RBI. India\u2019s banking regulator had granted an in-principle \u2018payment bank license\u2019 to 11 entities including Reliance Industries, Vodafone, Airtel, Paytm, among others in August 2015.</p>\n<p>Payment banks are allowed to open current, savings accounts for users with Rs 1 lakh as limit, but can\u2019t lend or issue credit cards to customers. Paytm\u2019s payment bank was initially supposed to launch in April 2016, but that has been delayed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are in the final process of completing the formalities and handing over the final applications to the RBI. We expect the payment bank to start sometime in August and are looking at network banking, but in a different way. For instance, we will have branches for our Paytm Bank, but not everywhere. We might have branches in some cities which will function as headquarters, but there will be no bank-teller counters here,\u201d said Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma in an interaction with the media on the sidelines of a joint event with Uber, China\u2019s Alipay and Paytm.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-nominates-six-indian-start-ups-for-its-launchpad-accelerator-program-2798437/\">Google nominates six Indian start-ups for its &#039;Launchpad Accelerator&#039; program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/\">Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-tap-to-translate-will-work-across-android-app-how-to-use-2796516/\">Google Tap to Translate will now work inside any app on Android: Here&#039;s how</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/\">Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-free-wifi-launched-for-ujjain-jaipur-patna-guwahati-allahabad-stations-2793095/\">Google free WiFi arrives at Ujjain, Jaipur, Patna, Guwahati and Allahabad stations</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>According to Sharma, Paytm\u2019s bank will be different from every other players by being entirely dependent on the mobile app. \u201cFinancial inclusion is our agenda and we are targeting 500 million users overall. Our banking will be entirely depended on the mobile app. We are also have Paytm ka ATM, which won\u2019t be like the current ones,\u201d said Sharma. Paytm says that unlike traditional ATMs where users go to withdraw money, they envisage a person, a shop, even a petrol pump outlet as a place where users can go and access their account.</p>\n<p>For users who don\u2019t have smartphones and can\u2019t access the app, Sharma says the company plans to launch debit cards with QR codes, which can be scanned at various points. Paytm says that it has tie-ups with 85,000 merchants where consumers can pay just via their Paytm wallet, and wants to reach 4 million merchants by the end of the next fiscal.</p>\n<p>On the reasons for the delay, Sharma said the company was trying to ensure that its launch was perfect. \u201cWe want to use core banking software such as <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/infosys/\">Infosys</a>\u2019 Finacle for our payment bank network,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\">Watch all our video reviews</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Paytm is also looking at extending its partnership with Chinese payment platform Alipay, which is owned by e-commerce site Alibaba. Alibaba is reported to have a 40 per cent stake in Paytm.</p>\n<p>The company says it is looking at deeper integration with Alipay, and is working on a system whereby Indian users will able to use their Paytm accounts at foreign merchant outlets that accept Alipay as a mode of payment. Sharma says he expects the integration to be live by October. Alipay has been expanding in South-East Asia.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2782485&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/paytm-bank-coming-in-august-says-ceo-vijay-shekhar-2782485/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/paytm_feat1.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/paytm_feat1.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Paytm_FEAT1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9fa26a5205a29f2c7954b0779012be5?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shrutidhaps</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/paytm_big1.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Paytm, Paytm payments bank, Paytm Payments Bank launch, Paytm discount, Paytm cashback, Paytm bank, Paytm bank offer, Paytm wallet, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Micromax Canvas 6 pre-bookings start today, priced at Rs 13,999</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/micromax-canvas6-sale-price-specs-2782847/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/micromax-canvas6-sale-price-specs-2782847/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 19:29:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 08:48:45 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mobile & Tabs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2782847</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Micromax Canvas 6 comes with full metal unibody design and sports a fingerprint scanner<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2782847&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/micromax-canvas6-big.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2782859\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/micromax-canvas6-big.jpg\" alt=\"Micromax, Micromax Canvas 6, Micromax Canvas 6 specs, Micromax Canvas 6 features, Micromax Canvas 6 price, smartphones, Android, tech news, technology\" /></a> Micromax Canvas 6 is the latest flagship from Indian company and it features metal unibody design (Source: Shruti Dhapola)\n<p>Micromax has announced it will commence registrations for its latest flagship Canvas 6 from May 4.

We see the consumer market is also growing with more first time buyers for entry-level DSLRs.&#8221; Koh said there was also a trend of people upgrading from entry level to the mid-range.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2782741&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/canon-eos-1d-x-mark-ii-launch-price-features-2782741/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/canon-eos1dx-markii-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/canon-eos1dx-markii-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Canon-EOS1DX-MarkII-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/canon-eos1dx-markii-big.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Canon EOS-1D X will stand out for offering 4K video recording at 60/50p and a frame grab option (Source: Canon)</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/andrew-canon-eos-big.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Canon, Canon EOS-1D X Mark II, Canon EOS-1D X Mark II specs, Canon EOS-1D X Mark II price, Canon EOS-1D X Mark II features, best professional DSLR, best DSLR camera, DSLR for wedding photographer, gadgets, tech news, technology</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Google Keyboard v5.0 rolling out with one-handed mode and other new features</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-keyboard-v5-0-rolling-out-with-one-handed-mode-new-festures-2782690/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-keyboard-v5-0-rolling-out-with-one-handed-mode-new-festures-2782690/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 18:17:47 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 18:20:39 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2782690</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Google's new Android keyboard comes with support for one-handed typing and new key borders<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2782690&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/google-keyboard-main.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2782715\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/google-keyboard-main.jpg\" alt=\"Google, Google Keyboard, Google Android keyboard, Google Keyboard version 5.0, Google Keyboard update, Google Android keyboard update, tech news, technology\" /></a> <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a>&#8217;s new Android keyboard comes with support for one-handed typing and new key borders (Source: Android Police)\n<p>Google Keyboard is the most understated app from the Mountain View based company on its Android platform.

India will be the most populous country in the world in 2022. India\u00a0today\u00a0has about 50 per cent of their population at 25 years of age or younger. It&#8217;s a very young country. People really want smartphones there, really want smartphones,&#8221; Cook said in a CNBC interview.</p>\n<p>He said in emerging markets like India, LTE (wireless) penetration is currently &#8220;zero&#8221; but as LTE begins to roll out this year in the country, the dynamics will change.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/pc-shipments-at-lowest-point-since-q2-2011-says-canalys/\">PC shipments at lowest point since Q2 2011, says Canalys</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-facebook-mothers-day-website-tribute-print-picture-2791200/\">&#039;MomShotsOniPhone&#039;: Apple and Facebook team up in tribute to Mother&#039;s Day</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apples-tim-cook-to-visit-china-for-government-meetings-2788530/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook to visit China for government meetings: report</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/strong-phone-security-challenge-for-enforcement-agencies-govt-2787928/\">Strong encryption a major challenge for enforcement agencies: Govt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-sap-partnership-aims-to-revolutionise-work-on-iphone-ipad/\">Apple, SAP partnership aims to &#039;revolutionise work&#039; on iPhone, iPad</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>&#8220;And so that&#8217;s changing. Huge market potential,&#8221; he said in response to a question about the Indian market for Apple.</p>\n<p>Cook said the company has got &#8220;great innovation&#8221; in the pipeline and new iPhones that will attract people in markets like India.</p>\n<p>Cook said in countries like India, Apple penetration has been less since there is no LTE networks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What I see is that countries like India, no LTE, so 0 percent penetration. They are selling smartphones, and we sell iPhone there. But arguably you can&#8217;t get the full value from it,&#8221; he said adding that retailers in markets like India are not &#8220;huge national kind of retailers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And the carriers don&#8217;t sell phones in India. So there&#8217;s a lot of work to do,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>While sales for Apple in China, its second-largest market after the United States, fell 11 per cent in the latest quarter, in India iPhone sales were up 56 per cent from a year ago.</p>\n<p>Noting the growth registered by Apple in India, Cook said &#8220;this is pretty big&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>He said Apple is &#8220;now&#8230;really putting energy in India&#8221; as well as in other markets across the world &#8220;where I think that people sitting here in this country look at it through just a lens of what\u2019s happening in the United States. And but there are a lot of people in the world who don\u2019t have the pleasure of owning an iPhone yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Apple had last week announced financial results for its fiscal 2016 second quarter ended March 26, 2016.</p>\n<p>The company posted quarterly revenue of USD 50.6 billion, down\u00a0from USD 58 billion in the year-ago quarter. Its quarterly net income stood at USD 10.5 billion, a decline from USD 13.6 billion in the same period last year.</p>\n<p>In a conference call following the results, Cook had said network infrastructure and retail remain among Apple\u2019s main challenges in India, with the market there today being where China was seven to ten years ago.</p>\n<p>Cook had said while India is the third-largest smartphone market in the world, it is dominated by &#8220;low-end&#8221; smartphones primarily because of the network and the economics due to which &#8220;the market potential has not been as great there&#8221;.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2782493&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-ceo-tim-cook-india-smartphone-market-2782493/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/apple-tim-cook-feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/apple-tim-cook-feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Apple-Tim-Cook-feat</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/apple-tim-cook-main.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company is really putting energy in India</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Kindle Oasis review: Greatness, but at a cost</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/kindle-oasis-review-amazon-price-india-specs-features-2782388/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/kindle-oasis-review-amazon-price-india-specs-features-2782388/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 16:17:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 07:47:06 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nandagopal Rajan]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech Reviews]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2782388</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Kindle Oasis charges a big premium for some cool new features.

To start with, it is square. Then it is light, and by light I mean really light if you keep the cover aside.\n<p>There is no point talking about the convenience of a Kindle anymore. Everyone who loves reading books owns one or aspires to have one in their hands in the near future. As someone who loves books, but doesn&#8217;t get the time to read as many as I want, I can tell you that any Kindle is a convenience. But is there a perfect Kindle? Well Amazon seems to have found its answer in the Kindle Oasis.</p>\n<p><strong>Kindle Oasis</strong></p>\n<p>The Kindle Oasis is different. To start with, it is square. Then it is light, and by light I mean really light if you keep the cover aside. And the cover is a part of the rig for it houses the extra battery as well as the charging port.</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Rs 23,999</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2782438 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kindle_oasis_big1.jpg\" alt=\"Kindle Oasis, Amazon Kindle Oasis, Amazon, Kindle Oasis price, Kindle Oasis review, New Kindle review, Kindle Oasis specs, Kindle Oasis features, Kindle Oasis vs Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Oasis Amazon, book reader, technology, technology news\" /> There are page flip buttons on the side, and they work whichever way you hold this Kindle.\n<p><strong>What is good?</strong></p>\n<p>All features in the new design come with benefits. The square shape and the wedge when you remove the cover give this Kindle a good grip.</p>\n<p>There are page flip buttons on the side, and they work whichever way you hold this Kindle. The buttons can even be customised depending on how you hold the device, left or right-handed.</p>\n<p>The display is quite crisp and easy on the eye. It can also become quite bright if needed. Coupled with the new UI, it looks very modern.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2782446 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kindle_oasis_big3.jpg\" alt=\"Kindle Oasis, Amazon Kindle Oasis, Amazon, Kindle Oasis price, Kindle Oasis review, New Kindle review, Kindle Oasis specs, Kindle Oasis features, Kindle Oasis vs Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Oasis Amazon, book reader, technology, technology news\" /> The Oasis Review unit with me was the 3G version, and I used it to buy the Sialkot Saga while sitting in a flight\n<p>You can now execute purchases from the Kindle itself. The Oasis Review unit with me was the 3G version, and I used it to buy the <em>Sialkot Saga</em> while sitting in a flight readying to take off for Mumbai. The experience was not so great, maybe because of the patchy network in the airport. But the fact that you can do this now is a big advantage, for earlier I would have had to do this on my phone.</p>\n<p>The Kindle homepage UI has changed and now it shows the best choices for me from stores as well as options based on my purchase behaviour.</p>\n<p>Amazon claims this Kindle will last months with the cover on. Other Kindles last weeks on a full charge. Obviously I could not check the months claim, but the battery pack on the cover should be able to see you through at least a month of casual reading for sure. But remember, the device itself has a battery smaller than other Kindles.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2782448 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/kindle_oasis_big4.jpg\" alt=\"Kindle Oasis, Amazon Kindle Oasis, Amazon, Kindle Oasis price, Kindle Oasis review, New Kindle review, Kindle Oasis specs, Kindle Oasis features, Kindle Oasis vs Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Oasis Amazon, book reader, technology, technology news\" /> This Kindle has no existence without the cover. It needs it to charge as well as to retain the charge\n<p><strong>What is not so good?</strong></p>\n<p>There is always a trade off when you opt for a thin form factor. For a device like a Kindle a smaller battery that is necessary for a thin body is almost unacceptable. And that is why they thought of this cover with the battery. However, that means the battery on the device sans the cover is not that great. It gave me just a couple of hours with the <em>Sialkot Saga</em> before the battery dropped to \u2018very low\u2019.</p>\n<p>This Kindle has no existence without the cover. It needs it to charge as well as to retain the charge. It is almost like a power bank. Amazon could have been a bit more clever about how to manage this, using the power on the pack before draining the device itself.</p>\n<p>I got the feeling the device battery drains faster when 3G is on; given the state of our networks this is not very surprising. So it might be a good idea to switch off the 3G when you don&#8217;t really need it.</p>\n<p>And there will always be the question: could they have given more at this price?</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\">Watch all our video reviews</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p><strong>Should you buy?</strong></p>\n<p>This is a great new Kindle, but one that charges a big premium for this greatness. Your urge to drop a few grams from an older Kindle like the Paperwhite has to be so strong that you are willing to pay a premium that is many times the price of the older one. I am quite happy with my Paperwhite.

This framegrab made available by the BBC on Monday May 2, 2016 shows creator of the Bitcoin, Craig Wright speaking in London. (BBC News via AP)\n<p>Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? For many in the tech world, the identity of bitcoin&#8217;s elusive creator has been a long-running parlor game. And the speculation might not be over.</p>\n<p>Australian entrepreneur Craig Steven Wright, who announced Monday that he founded the digital currency , convinced at least one longtime bitcoin contributor that he&#8217;s the real deal. He managed that feat via a technical demonstration involving Nakamoto&#8217;s secret bitcoin keys. But Wright&#8217;s public documentation, which he posted online Monday , underwhelmed others and left the question of Nakamoto&#8217;s true identity far from settled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way you can conclusively prove that you are the creator of bitcoin,&#8221; said Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, a Washington, D.C.-based crypto-currency think tank, who is skeptical of Wright&#8217;s claims.</p>\n<p>Tracking a pseudonymous cryptographic genius would be challenging under the best circumstances. And here we&#8217;re talking someone who invented a way for people to send money around the world anonymously, without banks or national currencies. Someone who apparently disappeared five years ago for unknown reasons.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-nominates-six-indian-start-ups-for-its-launchpad-accelerator-program-2798437/\">Google nominates six Indian start-ups for its &#039;Launchpad Accelerator&#039; program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/\">Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-tap-to-translate-will-work-across-android-app-how-to-use-2796516/\">Google Tap to Translate will now work inside any app on Android: Here&#039;s how</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/\">Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-free-wifi-launched-for-ujjain-jaipur-patna-guwahati-allahabad-stations-2793095/\">Google free WiFi arrives at Ujjain, Jaipur, Patna, Guwahati and Allahabad stations</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>None of that has stopped people from trying. Journalists, researchers and amateur detectives have scoured Nakamoto&#8217;s emails and online posts, plus the original bitcoin code, for unusual phrases, cultural references and other potential clues to their author.</p>\n<p>One of the most celebrated candidates _ to his own dismay _ was an unassuming Japanese-American engineer who found himself in the cross-hairs of Newsweek magazine in 2014.</p>\n<p>A Newsweek cover story fingered Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a retired resident of suburban Los Angeles County, after citing circumstantial clues and a vague comment that Nakamoto made when confronted briefly on his front doorstep. The article sparked a media frenzy and a car chase with reporters that ended at the Los Angeles offices of The Associated Press _ where Dorian Nakamoto emphatically denied any involvement with bitcoin.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/bitcoin-creator-craig-wright-satoshi-nakamoto-2780403/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin creator identified as Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright</a></strong></p>\n<p>An earlier contender named in a 2011 New Yorker magazine piece was Michael Clear, then a graduate student in cryptography at Trinity College in Dublin. The New Yorker cited some of Nakamoto&#8217;s writings, which used British slang such as &#8220;maths&#8221; for mathematics and &#8220;flat&#8221; for an apartment. It also noted that Clear had worked on currency-trading software for an Irish bank and co-authored a paper on &#8220;peer-to-peer&#8221; technology similar to that used in bitcoin.</p>\n<p>At first, according to the New Yorker, Clear was evasive when asked at a cryptography conference if he had created bitcoin. But he later denied it repeatedly. He also suggested another candidate to the New Yorker reporter, naming Finnish researcher Vili Lehdonvirta, who studied virtual currencies and created video games.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2781627 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bitcoins_founder_big2.jpg\" alt=\"Craig Wright, Craig Wright as Bitcoin creator, Craig Wright as Satoshi Nakamoto, Satoshi Nakamoto, Satoshi Nakamoto conspiracy theories, Satoshi Nakamoto theories, Craig Wright fraud, Satoshi Nakamoto real identity, Bitcoins, Bitcoins founder, technology, technology news\" /> This is a Oct. 16, 2015 file photo of a Bitcoin ATM.

of being\u00a0similar in size to Earth, &#8220;potentially habitable&#8221; and close\u00a0enough so their atmospheres can be analysed with current\u00a0technology, he told AFP.</p>\n<p>The find opens up a whole new &#8220;hunting ground&#8221; for\u00a0habitable planets, he added.</p>\n<p>Gillon and colleagues calibrated a 60-centimetre telescope\u00a0in Chile, known as TRAPPIST, to track several dozen dwarf\u00a0stars neither big nor hot enough to be visible with optical\u00a0telescopes.</p>\n<p>They zeroed in on a particularly promising one &#8211; now known\u00a0as TRAPPIST-1 &#8211; about one eighth the size of the Sun, and\u00a0significantly cooler.</p>\n<p>Observing it for months, the astronomers noticed that its\u00a0infrared signal faded slightly at regular intervals, evidence\u00a0of objects in orbit.</p>\n<p>Further analysis confirmed they were exoplanets &#8211; planets\u00a0revolving around stars outside our solar system.</p>\n<p>The innermost two circle their dwarf star every 1.5 and\u00a02.4 days, though they are hit with only four and two times the\u00a0amount of heat-generating radiation that Earth receives from\u00a0the Sun.</p>\n<p>The more distant orbit of the third planet takes between\u00a0four and 73 days, according to the study.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So far, the existence of such &#8216;red worlds&#8217; orbiting\u00a0ultra-cool dwarf stars was purely theoretical, but now we have\u00a0not just one lonely planet but three,&#8221; said co-author Emmanuel\u00a0Jehin, also from the University of Liege.</p>\n<p>He called the discovery a &#8220;paradigm shift&#8221; in the search\u00a0for life elsewhere in the universe.</p>\n<p>Given their size and proximity to their low-intensity\u00a0star, all three planets may have regions at temperatures\u00a0within a range suitable for sustaining liquid water and life,\u00a0the study concluded.</p>\n<p>Their proximity to Earth means scientists will be able to\u00a0find out a lot more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These planets are so close, and their star so small, we\u00a0can study their atmosphere and composition,&#8221; said co-author\u00a0Julien de Wit, a postdoc at the Massachusetts Institute of\u00a0Technology (MIT.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a jackpot for the field,&#8221; he said in a statement,\u00a0adding that it should be possible to determine if they harbour\u00a0life &#8220;within our generation.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig\">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2781212&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/scientists-discover-three-potentially-habitable-planets-40-light-years-away-2781212/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/planet480.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/planet480.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">planet480</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4585c93d1d73bd036325c17018cff5da?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">dshreya</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/planet759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">potentially habitable planets, earth like planets, three habitable planet discovery, MIT habitable planets discover, habitable dwarf planets, TRAPPIST-1, ultracool habitable planet, science news, world news, latest news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Portronics POSH, a Bluetooth-enabled speaker announced at Rs 2,499</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/portronics-posh-a-bluetooth-enabled-speaker-announced-at-rs-2499-2781041/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/portronics-posh-a-bluetooth-enabled-speaker-announced-at-rs-2499-2781041/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 18:59:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 18:59:09 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Gadgets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2781041</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Portronics has launched POSH, a Bluetooth-enabled speaker at Rs 2,499.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2781041&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2781047 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/portronics-posh-black-759.jpg\" alt=\"Portronics, Portronics POSH, Portronics POSH price, Portronics POSH features, Portronics POSH specs, portable speakers, Portronics speakers, Bluetooth speakers, gadgets, technology, technology news\" /> Portronics has launched POSH, a Bluetooth-enabled speaker at Rs 2,499.\n<p>Portronics has launched POSH, a Bluetooth-enabled speaker at Rs 2,499.

reduce the burden on the industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The &#8216;pay as you earn&#8217; payment terms is a win-win situation both for the industry and the government,&#8221; the operator, an arm of Norway-based Telenor, has said in a letter\u00a0to DoT.</p>\n<p>The communication has come days after Norway-based Telenor&#8217;s top management expressed concerns over &#8216;high-priced&#8217; spectrum in India and indicated an exit from the country if it fails to procure frequencies at reasonable price either through auction or trading route.</p>\n<p>On the one hand the payment burden on the TSPs (telecom service providers) is eased in the initial years and the resources will be utilised in roll-out of the networks, on the other hand there will be no loss to the exchequer,&#8221;

Its latest is the Life Mark, which wants to be seen in the highly competitive sub Rs 10,000 price bracket.</p>\n<p><strong>BLU Life Mark</strong></p>\n<p>The BLU Life Mark is a package of all the good features quickly put in place for an exhibition, but is it any good for long-term use? Here is our review:</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2780795 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8352.jpg\" alt=\"BLU, Blu Life Mark, Blu Life Mark review, Blu Life Mark specs, Blu Life Mark price, Blu Life Mark features, Blu Life Mark launch, smartphones, technology, technology news\" /> BLU Life Mark wields a pretty decent camera with very fancy features.\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong> 5-inch HD IPS Display (720px1280p) | 1.3 GHz; 64-bit quad-core processor | 2 GB RAM | 16 GB storage | 13 MP rear camera + 5 MP front cam | 2,300 mAh battery| Android 5.1 Lollipop | | SIM: GSM + GSM | Price: Rs 8,999</p>\n<p><strong>What is good?</strong></p>\n<p>For shutterbugs this device wields a pretty decent camera with very fancy features. I personally found live photo and motion tracking modes interesting among other options. A quick six-second live photo or a three-frame object motion tracking is more than what you can get from phones in this price bracket.</p>\n<p>The fingerprint scanner is also unique in this price range. The small square sensor underneath the camera is a quick to reach and a secure unlocking mechanism to access the phone. Adding to that, the brand has gone a little creative by adding multiple waking gestures and smart motions.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2780777 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8353.jpg\" alt=\"BLU, Blu Life Mark, Blu Life Mark review, Blu Life Mark specs, Blu Life Mark price, Blu Life Mark features, Blu Life Mark launch, smartphones, technology, technology news \" /> The fingerprint scanner in BLU Life Mark is unique in this price range. The small square sensor underneath the camera is a quick to reach and a secure unlocking mechanism to access the phone.\n<p>The phone aces in its multi-tasking capability and does pretty well even when multiple apps are open. Browsing the Internet on the device is a rich experience. Websites, even flash-heavy, load quite quickly with rapid touch response. It\u2019s also pretty easy with the pinch-ins and outs where the sharpness of the text is retained way till the maximum zoom possible.</p>\n<p><strong>What is not good?</strong></p>\n<p>This phone isn\u2019t particularly stylish. It is the output of an assembly line of round edged plastic-back devices where the only differentiator is brand label. The rear-panel has a glossy finish which tends to slip even in mildly damp palms and the volume rocker and power button are quite jagged and will be sharp on your fingers. But if you try holding the phone on its matte finish sides, you can manage the device without clumsily dropping it while typing.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2780770 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_8346.jpg\" alt=\"BLU, Blu Life Mark, Blu Life Mark review, Blu Life Mark specs, Blu Life Mark price, Blu Life Mark features, Blu Life Mark launch, smartphones, technology, technology news \" /> BLU Life Mark isn\u2019t particularly stylish. It is the output of an assembly line of round edged plastic-back devices where the only differentiator is brand label.\n<p>For audiophiles, the phone is a big turn off as it has shoddy earplugs (and sound system too) and a speaker which joins the chorus of other low-budget Chinese phone. In fact, the phone is on a high-treble-no-bass mode at all times.</p>\n<p>The camera doesn\u2019t completely do justice to the 13MP+5MP equation. It has its downfalls when it comes to zooming. After a couple of pinch-outs, the picture gets quite grainy which seems to be not a big problem with phones in similar range (even with less MP cameras). Though there are multiples modes of capturing pictures, what good is it when you have to compromise on quality?</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2780783 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/img_20160407_120835.jpg\" alt=\"BLU, Blu Life Mark, Blu Life Mark review, Blu Life Mark specs, Blu Life Mark price, Blu Life Mark features, Blu Life Mark launch, smartphones, technology, technology news \" /> The camera in BLU Life Mark doesn\u2019t completely do justice to the 13MP+5MP equation. It has its downfalls when it comes to zooming.

It has an underweight 2,300 mAh unit desperately trying to feed and train a heavyweight champ. The battery will die just in 4 to 6 hours if you are on <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/4g/\">4G</a> playing a multiplayer game online or if you are streaming HD videos on YouTube. The battery capacity is ideal for calling, messaging and browsing net and for social media, but then again who would buy a smartphone just for that!</p>\n<p><strong>Should I buy it?</strong></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to shell out Rs 9,000 for just a fingerprint sensor or multiple camera options. In a tight market where a slew of other brands are filling the space with mid-range phones like Acer liquid, Asus Zenfone, Micromax Canvas Xpress or Lenovo K3, this phone fails to leave a mark.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2780750&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\"

Ola, an Indian company backed by Japan&#8217;s SoftBank Group Corp , denies any wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>Uber is suing Ola for $7.5 million to compensate for lost revenue and goodwill, alleging the Indian market leader created about 94,000 fake user accounts with the ride-hailing service and used them to make more than 405,000 false bookings.</p>\n<p>The broad outlines of the lawsuit were reported when it was filed last month, but a Reuters review of court filings and interviews with sources close to both sides have uncovered new details about how Uber says it was able to trace fake bookings and calls to Ola employees, and Ola&#8217;s response to the allegations.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-hc-asks-taxi-services-to-provide-details-of-drivers-for-police-check-2794357/\">Delhi HC asks taxi services to provide details of drivers for police check</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/soon-uber-users-can-pay-via-paytm-while-abroad/\">Soon, Uber India users will be able to pay via Paytm while abroad</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/hungary-wants-to-drive-out-uber-from-the-country-2780937/\">Hungary wants to drive out Uber from the country</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/uber-vs-ola-heres-everything-that-has-happened-so-far-2780273/\">Uber vs Ola: Here&#039;s everything that has happened so far</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/surge-pricing-arvind-kejriwal-uber-ola-cabs-taxi-petrol-diesel-run-cabs-2779498/\">Uber brings back surge pricing as odd-even ends, Kejriwal warns of strong action</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>It paints a picture of a no-holds-barred corporate battle between the two start-ups in one of the world&#8217;s fastest growing taxi markets, where both have been burning millions of dollars of investor money as they seek to undercut each other with cheaper fares.</p>\n<p>A source close to Ola said the case against it had been fabricated in retaliation for a lawsuit it had filed earlier this year accusing Uber of flouting a court order to switch to clean-fuel cars in the Indian capital.</p>\n<p>Uber said it could not comment on a matter that was still before the courts, and Reuters was unable to independently verify the allegations made by either side.<br />\nSoftBank, one of Ola&#8217;s largest investors, declined to comment on the case.</p>\n<p><strong>Four-month investigation</strong></p>\n<p>Uber&#8217;s investigation identified locations and internet protocol addresses of tens of thousands of users who had booked and cancelled rides, using information logged when a new customer account is created on Uber&#8217;s platform, the source familiar with the company&#8217;s case said.</p>\n<p>In court documents, Uber says it found 660 accounts used to make troublesome bookings came from a building housing Ola&#8217;s office in the western city of Pune.

When Reuters called the number, the person answering identified himself as college student Shashank Kumar in Pune and said Kisan was his brother.</p>\n<p>Shashank said he often used Uber and Ola but had not made repeated cancellations on the Uber platform. Reuters was unable to contact Kisan for comment. Another number Reuters was able to connect to belonged to someone identified as &#8220;Shiv D&#8221; in Uber&#8217;s filings, which alleged he created 30 fake accounts to book and cancel dozens of rides.</p>\n<p>Shiv D said he had worked for Ola helping drivers get new cars, but denied Uber&#8217;s allegations and said he had since left the company. The fake bookings are not the only accusation levelled by Uber against Ola.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Uber says one of its biggest losses of earnings came on New Year&#8217;s Eve, when drivers in New Delhi began getting calls around 5 p.m. telling them to shut off the ride-hailing app as there was a technical glitch that needed to be fixed.</p>\n<p>When they checked back hours later to see if they could get back online they were told Uber had made no such calls.

But Reliance Jio might change it all. Representational Image. (Image source: Reuters)\n<p>Over the past year or so, every other smartphone manufacturer or Internet company I speak to keeps alluding to the big growth India is going to see when Reliance Jio finally launches its consumer services. While smartphone companies are expecting a big jump in the number of <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/4g/\">4G</a> devices sold, the Internet companies are certain consumption of all types of content, especially video, will see an unprecedented spurt.</p>\n<p>Also licking their lips are gaming companies and those who want to invest in gaming companies. Across the world gaming is considered one of the pillars of the Internet economy along with e-commerce and, of course, online ads. However, India hasn&#8217;t quite achieved its full potential thanks to issues with connectivity and the payment infrastructure.</p>\n<p>People like Alex Qian, now the Vice-President of Internet company Leomaster, thinks Reliance Jio will fix the first issue to a great extent. Even otherwise he hopes the gaming industry in India to be around $1 billion by the end of this year, almost double of what it was in 2015.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/photos/technology-gallery/reliance-jio-4g-ready-sim-how-to-buy-2789205/\">Reliance Jio 4G-ready SIM: Here is how you can get hold of one</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/reliance-jio-4g-lyf-trial-service-public-2786306/\">Reliance Jio opens 4G service for public, but here is the catch</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/mobile-gaming-india-reliance-jio-future-2780175/\">Why India could be on the verge of a mobile gaming boom</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/reliance-jio-offers-new-bay-of-bengal-gateway/\">Reliance Jio offers new Bay of Bengal Gateway</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/policy-changes-to-facilitate-rcom-jio-spectrum-sharing-report/\">Policy changes to facilitate RCOM, Jio spectrum sharing: Report</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>\u201cIndia is now where China was seven years ago when you look at market size.

Leomaster has some very popular apps like Leo Privacy, but is banking on its gaming platform Joy Plus to reap rich dividends in India.</p>\n<p>Alex explains that unlike e-commerce, which is a monopolistic market, gaming gives a fair chance to everyone to survive. So Leomaster is keen on collaborating with local gaming companies and is even open to investing in good ones.

But the network problems will be solved this year or the beginning of next year,\u201d Alex is confident.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2780196\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/gaming_chart_1.jpg\" alt=\"Gaming, Mobile gaming in India, Reliance Jio, Reliance Jio gaming, Reliance Jio India gaming, Reliance Jio India launch, Jio Launch, Reliance Jio speeds, Reliance speeds, RJio net, technology, technology news\" width=\"700\" height=\"332\" /></p>\n<p>And LeoMaster is not the only company rooting for gaming. Rovio, the Finnish company behind mobile gaming legend Angry Birds, has just launched another version to coincide with the release of the Angry Birds movie. And it is not just another game, because it has never before seen offline elements that add value to both the movie and the game. Rovio is going full throttle promoting both in India.</p>\n<p>Anurag Sachdeva, Country Director (India &amp; South Asia) at Rovio Entertainment, says India is up there on top for his company when it comes to audience. \u201cAngry Birds still commands over 450 million annual downloads and India is an important location for us,\u201d he explains.</p>\n<p>Sachdeva says it is wrong to generalise that Indians won\u2019t pay for content on mobile when they actually don\u2019t have the means to. \u201cEven if we believe everyone with a credit card has a smartphone, there would still be millions of people who don\u2019t have access to a payment ecosystem,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cWe will know if the Indian consumer actually pays only once we have operator billing in place. The consumer always throws up surprises.\u201d</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2780195\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/gaming_chart_2.jpg\" alt=\"Gaming, Mobile gaming in India, Reliance Jio, Reliance Jio gaming, Reliance Jio India gaming, Reliance Jio India launch, Jio Launch, Reliance Jio speeds, Reliance speeds, RJio net, technology, technology news\" width=\"800\" height=\"390\" /></p>\n<p>Another factor that has been holding back gaming growth in the country for many years was the size of games. Heavy games, let\u2019s say above 25MB, were never much popular because people did not want to spend their precious data downloading these.</p>\n<p><strong>Also see: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/reliance-jio-launch-delay-company-denies-technical-glitch/\" target=\"_blank\">Reliance Jio launch delay: Company says it is ensuring full network optimisation before rollout</a></strong></p>\n<p>However, that could also change if data from the pilot run of Reliance Jio is any indication. The company, in its earnings release last week, said the average monthly downloads on their internal testing systems was as a high 18GB per user. This indicates that cheaper, faster and unfettered data ecosystems could get Indians to consume much more content than before.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\">Watch all our video reviews</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>And the competition from Reliance Jio, whenever it launches, could lead to a price war between telcos resulting in cheaper data plans for the users.

Instead, Yahoo&#8217;s long-running slump has deepened during her reign, making her pay a prickly topic among investors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this management team has done anything to merit a huge payout,&#8221; said Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management, a Yahoo shareholder critical of Mayer&#8217;s leadership.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-nominates-six-indian-start-ups-for-its-launchpad-accelerator-program-2798437/\">Google nominates six Indian start-ups for its &#039;Launchpad Accelerator&#039; program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/\">Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-tap-to-translate-will-work-across-android-app-how-to-use-2796516/\">Google Tap to Translate will now work inside any app on Android: Here&#039;s how</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/\">Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-free-wifi-launched-for-ujjain-jaipur-patna-guwahati-allahabad-stations-2793095/\">Google free WiFi arrives at Ujjain, Jaipur, Patna, Guwahati and Allahabad stations</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>Yahoo declined to comment beyond its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The documents didn&#8217;t explain the rationale for the severance packages covering Mayer and other Yahoo executives, although they are common at most publicly held companies as a way to maintain some stability during times of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Mayer received a compensation package valued at nearly $36 million last year under the SEC&#8217;s accounting rules. Yahoo&#8217;s board maintained in its filing that it was only worth about $14 million as of April 1.</p>\n<p>The chances of a sale happening at Yahoo Inc. increased earlier this week when the Sunnyvale, California, company reached a truce with activist investor Starboard Value, an outspoken critic of Mayer&#8217;s that has been pushing her to sell. Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith is now one of three Yahoo directors on a special committee assessing the bids for the Internet business.</p>\n<p>Although Yahoo&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t set a timetable for reaching a decision, most analysts expect a deal to be struck within the next two months at a price ranging anywhere from $4 billion to $10 billion.</p>\n<p>In an opinion shared by most of his peers on Wall Street, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney says he believes Verizon Communications is the most likely buyer. After snapping up AOL Inc., another fallen Internet start, for $4.4 billion, Verizon has publicly expressed interest in taking over Yahoo, too.</p>\n<p>That has spurred speculation that AOL CEO Tim Armstrong will shove aside Mayer if Verizon buys Yahoo&#8217;s Internet operations. Armstrong was a top advertising executive at Google during much of the same time Mayer was working on some of the products that helped turn Google into the Internet&#8217;s most powerful company.</p>\n<p>Mayer&#8217;s inability to boost Yahoo&#8217;s advertising sales at a time that marketers are shifting more of their budgets to digital services is the main reason investors are pushing the company to cash out and turn its Internet operations to a new owner.</p>\n<p>Last year, for instance, Yahoo&#8217;s board set a target asking management to generate $4.6 billion in revenue, after subtracting ad commissions. That would have been a modest 5 percent increase from the previous year. Yahoo&#8217;s revenue last year instead came in at $4.1 billion.</p>\n<p>The company this year expects its revenue after ad commissions to decline another 15 percent to a projected $3.5 billion.</p>\n<p>Mayer is nearly done with a cost-cutting plan that is jettisoning 15 percent of Yahoo&#8217;s workforce in an effort to boost profits as revenue drops.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\">Watch all our video reviews</a></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Yahoo&#8217;s stock added a penny to close Friday at $36.60, more than double its value in July 2012 when the company hired Mayer. But the run-up has been driven by the rising value of Yahoo&#8217;s stake in China&#8217;s e-commerce leader, Alibaba Group.</p>\n<p>The investment in Alibaba was made long before Mayer&#8217;s hiring, although she has been unsuccessfully trying to find a legal way to avoid paying taxes when the stake is sold.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2780080&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-severance-package-55-mn-2780080/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/marissamayer_1.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/marissamayer_1.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">MarissaMayer_1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9fa26a5205a29f2c7954b0779012be5?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shrutidhaps</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/marissamayer_2.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Yahoo, Yahoo Marissa Mayer, Marissa Mayer Severance pay, Severance package, Marissa Mayer salary, Marissa Mayer CEO, yahoo sale, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>How a Chinese cab service uses AI to purge the surge</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/chinese-company-didi-chuxing-uses-artificial-intelligence-peak-hour-surge-pricing-ola-uber-2779421/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/chinese-company-didi-chuxing-uses-artificial-intelligence-peak-hour-surge-pricing-ola-uber-2779421/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 18:27:53 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 18:27:53 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Leela Prasad]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2779421</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[In China, cab aggregator Didi Chuxing is betting big on Artificial Intelligence and Big Data to make their algorithms predict demand and adjust the number of drivers in a locality for maximum efficiency.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2779421&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2779425 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/didi-chuxing-759.jpg\" alt=\"Didi Chuxing, chinese cab service, Didi Chuxing surge pricing, uber ola, uber ola surge pricing, peak hour surge priceing, cab service surge price, technology news, latest news\" /> The company aims to predict demand in a locality based on past trends such as office hours and deploy drivers to that area to meet the rush.\n<p>The second phase of Delhi\u2019s odd-even rule ended Saturday, but restrictions on \u201csurge pricing\u201d used by cab aggregators Ola and Uber to meet demand and supply is not expected to end till the state government issues sector-specific guidelines.</p>\n<p>During the 15-day period of the road rationing scheme, the Delhi government forced Ola and Uber to suspend surge-pricing after its users complained of fares as high as five times the normal fare during peak hours.

So, according to Schiller, when we said &#8220;Apple launches new iPhones, iPads&#8221; or &#8220;Apple&#8217;s latest Macs come with updated processors,&#8221; we were wrong. We, being pretty much everyone in the world.</p>\n<p>Apparently the debate over iPhones, sorry iPhone devices, started when Benedict Evans shared a podcast link with \u201ciPads Pro,\u201d in the caption.

In a conversation with IndianExpress.com, Saavn cofounder Paramdeep Singh said, \u201cRadio isn&#8217;t dead but has evolved into more diversified content often referred to as podcasts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Saavn believes podcast is the new way to go for audio, one that will engage users for a longer period of time. If Netflix is the new video, Saavn wants to be its audio equivalent. The music-streaming service\u00a0claims to have over 18 million monthly active users.</p>\n<p>What is a Podcast? Podcast is the modern day radio or simply \u201cradio of the future\u201d. If you opened Saavn app this morning, you might have already discovered new podcasts available for streaming.</p>\n<p>With original programming, Saavn aims to transform into a platform that goes beyond music artists, but as one that also allows music producers and sound engineers to bring their ideas to life.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-nominates-six-indian-start-ups-for-its-launchpad-accelerator-program-2798437/\">Google nominates six Indian start-ups for its &#039;Launchpad Accelerator&#039; program</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-msu-girl-gets-google-summer-code-project-2797375/\">Gujarat: MSU student bags Google project for writing codes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/google-tap-to-translate-will-work-across-android-app-how-to-use-2796516/\">Google Tap to Translate will now work inside any app on Android: Here&#039;s how</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-audio-review-features-price-2795478/\">Google Chromecast Audio Review: Here is how to turn your old speaker smart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-free-wifi-launched-for-ujjain-jaipur-patna-guwahati-allahabad-stations-2793095/\">Google free WiFi arrives at Ujjain, Jaipur, Patna, Guwahati and Allahabad stations</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>Paramdeep says that the company will however stay true to its core business of aggregating content, but sees original programming as an organisation within the organisation.\u00a0Saavn, which recently raised $100 million from Tiger Global Management and others, is widely acclaimed as the Spotify of India and this move can be seen <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/saavn-an-indian-music-streaming-service-that-wants-to-thrive-on-regional-content/\">as a teaser to its imminent video streaming launch.</a></p>\n<p>With Netflix (and binge watching) gaining popularity, Saavn\u2019s original programming debut couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time.

At the time of the Ringing Bells Freedom 251 launch, we had reported that the mobile industry could not accept the Rs 251 price tag and there are several good reasons for this.</p>\n<p>For starters\u00a0Indian Cellular Association (ICA) president <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/ringing-bells-freedom-251-price-specs-features-buy-book-online-why-the-phone-at-rs-251-is-not-ringing-a-bell-for-everyone/\">Pankaj Mohindroo had told IndianExpress.com </a>at the time of the Ringing Bells launch\u00a0that this \u201cpricing is not possible under any circumstances, even if the components are made in India\u201d. He said the bill for material for a product like this would be around $40.</p>\n<p>If you look at the specs of the Docoss X1, which is pretty similar, and assuming that the $40 bill sticks, the price comes to around Rs 2,600. \u00a0In such cases, even the\u00a0Rs 888 price-tag raises some serious questions.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2778908\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/docoss_1gallery.jpg\" alt=\" Docoss X1, Docoss X1 booking, Docoss X1 Android phone, Cheapest Android, Cheapest smartphone, Cheapest Android smartphone, Ringing Bells, Ringing Bells Freedom 251, Freedom 251 specs, Freedom 251 vs Docoss X1, smartphones, technology, technology news\" width=\"820\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Also see: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/photos/technology-gallery/docoss-x1-android-smartphone-real-images-video-2778005/\" target=\"_blank\">Docoss X1 priced at Rs 888: Check out the first real images</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/freedom-251-buy-freedom-251-just-how-cheap-can-a-smartphone-get/\"><strong>As we had explained earlier</strong></a>,\u00a0phones usually have a bill of material (BoM) cost on top of which comes the manufacturing cost, plus components like taxes and duties, and marketing cost and profits \u2014 together making up the final selling price. In offline sales at least, the dealer has a considerable margin \u2014 which is why you see large variations in prices of the same product. Of late, the trend has been to subsidise this figure to capture markets, especially India. In the BoM, usually the cellular radio is the costliest \u2014 making up about 30% of the cost. With the processor and rest of the circuit, this could go up to 50%. The mechanical parts come next, followed by display, storage/memory and the camera component.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/freedom-251-buy-freedom-251-just-how-cheap-can-a-smartphone-get/\" target=\"_blank\">Freedom 251 pricing explained: Just how cheap can a smartphone get?</a></strong></p>\n<p>Analyst Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO &amp; Founder at Greyhound Knowledge Group,<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/freedom-251-buy-freedom-251-just-how-cheap-can-a-smartphone-get/\"> had told us at the launch of Freedom 251</a>, that the lowest price point seen so far on a smartphone was $ 28, or about Rs 1,700. Docoss X1 and Freedom 251 are both considerably lower than this price-point.</p>\n<p>So what are Ringing Bells and Docoss playing at with this impossible pricing? Someone who has been in this industry for many years, says the kind of publicity a cheap phone gives is unparalleled. And as we have seen with the Freedom 251, the interest among the public was unprecedented. So burning some money to subsidise and deliver a few thousands, or just a hundred-odd devices, might be\u00a0worth it in the long run as it will help create brand recognition like no ad campaign can.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\">Watch all our video reviews</a></strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Also, even if someone decides to sue you for\u00a0inability to fulfill orders or quality of service, you just need to pay the price you charged for the device for a settlement. It might not be bad business after all.</p>\n<p>However, the worrying issue is how companies are using the Make in India campaign to promote products that are made abroad. The government has to crack down on misuse of this label if it has to be taken seriously.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778825&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/docoss-x1-ringing-bells-price-specs-impossible-explained-low-cost-2778825/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/docossx1_feat_1.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/docossx1_feat_1.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">DocossX1_FEAT_1</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9fa26a5205a29f2c7954b0779012be5?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">shrutidhaps</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/docossx1_big_new.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Docoss X1 booking, Docoss X1 Android phone, How to book Docoss, Docoss X1 website, Docoss X1 specs, Cheapest Android smartphone, android phone for less than Rs 1000, Ringing Bells, Ringing Bells Freedom 251, Freedom 251 specs, Freedom 251 vs Docoss X1, smartphones, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/docoss_1gallery.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\"> Docoss X1, Docoss X1 booking, Docoss X1 Android phone, Cheapest Android, Cheapest smartphone, Cheapest Android smartphone, Ringing Bells, Ringing Bells Freedom 251, Freedom 251 specs, Freedom 251 vs Docoss X1, smartphones, technology, technology news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Samsung&#8217;s offers: Get Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5 at Re 1, and here&#8217;s how</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/samsung-galaxy-s6-note-5-re-1-offer-deals-discounts-specs/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/samsung-galaxy-s6-note-5-re-1-offer-deals-discounts-specs/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 10:55:47 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 09:38:13 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mobile & Tabs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2778767</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Samsung is currently offering deals on its Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5 where users can get buy these smartphones by paying just Re 1 for each.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778767&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=\"wp-image-2778800 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/samsunggalaxys6_1.jpg\" alt=\"S6 deals, Samsung Make for India offer, Samsung Galaxy S6 offer, Samsung Note 5 offer, Samsung, Samsung Re 1 Galaxy S6, Note 5 Re 1 offer, Galaxy Note 5 at Re 1, Samsung discounts, Samsung AC discount, technology, technology news\" /> Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5 are available at Re 1 under the company&#8217;s &#8216;Make for India&#8217;

It needs power to work. Much like charging a phone, you can fit its cable into a power socket or into a USB-port on your TV.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you set Up Chromecast?</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s super simple. Here&#8217;s all you&#8217;ll need:</p>\n<p>1) A Google Chromecast</p>\n<p>2) A Chromecast charger cable (standard micro-USB to USB).</p>\n<p>3) A Wi-Fi network with an active internet connection.</p>\n<p>4) An Android or iOS smartphone or tablet.</p>\n<p>5) The Google Cast<a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_cast_category_all?hl=en\"> app for Android</a> or <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-cast/id680819774?mt=8\">for iOS.</a><br />\n6) A TV with at least one free HDMI port.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2778714 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/chromecast2_big_2.jpg\" alt=\"Chromecast 2, Google Chromecast 2, Chromecast 2 buy, Chromecast 2 vs Chromecast 1, Chromecast 2 price, Chromecast 2 features, Chromecast 2 specs, Chromecast 2 streaming apps, Chromecast 2 Netflix, Netflix on Chromecast, technology, technology news\" /> Once set up, the Chromecast is an extraordinarily valuable tool. It has a bunch of uses, which can help turn your regular old TV into a smart TV that your phone can talk to.\n<p>Plug the Chromecast into the TV, and switch to the HDMI port. Start the Google Cast app on your phone or tablet. Follow the on-screen instructions and you should be set up in a matter of minutes. Just remember, your phone and your TV need to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.</p>\n<p><strong>What can I use it for?</strong></p>\n<p>Once set up, the Chromecast is an extraordinarily valuable tool.

It&#8217;s fantastic for presentations.</p>\n<p>6) Similarly, you can mirror your entire Android device&#8217;s screen on the TV.</p>\n<p>7) <a href=\"http://www.greenbot.com/article/2881460/the-10-best-android-games-to-play-on-your-tv-with-chromecast.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chromecast-supported Android games</a> can be played on the big screen.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2778713 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/chromecast2_big_3.jpg\" alt=\"Chromecast 2, Google Chromecast 2, Chromecast 2 buy, Chromecast 2 vs Chromecast 1, Chromecast 2 price, Chromecast 2 features, Chromecast 2 specs, Chromecast 2 streaming apps, Chromecast 2 Netflix, Netflix on Chromecast, technology, technology news\" /> Google Chromecast 2 isn&#8217;t perfect.

While there&#8217;s a lot you can do with it, it isn&#8217;t the answer to all your phone-to-TV or laptop-to-TV needs.</p>\n<p>1) Casting your screen or tab lets you see any website or video on the big screen. But be prepared for a low frame rate, which can spoil the viewing experience.</p>\n<p>2) Not every video, photo, or music app is supported. For example, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/apple-ios-8-4-update-with-apple-music-is-now-out-costs-rs-120-per-month/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Music is available in India</a>, but doesn&#8217;t work on Chromecast.

It depends on your Wi-Fi connection.</p>\n<p>4) Any app that doesn&#8217;t support Chromecast won&#8217;t play. This includes several popular Indian services like Hotstar, StarSports.com, Apple Music, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes Chromecast 2 better than Chromecast 1?</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking of Wi-Fi connections, that&#8217;s where the Chromecast 2 is far superior to the original Chromecast (<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/google-chromecast-review-the-big-screen-advantage/\" target=\"_blank\">read our review</a>). Chromecast 2 supports the 801.11/ac Wi-Fi standard, and can be connected to a 5GHz frequency.</p>\n<p>The original Chromecast was limited to 802.11 N standard with 2.4GHz frequency. In layman&#8217;s terms, the new Chromecast is faster and thus appears smoother\u2014especially when casting your screen to play games.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more:\u00a0<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/here-is-the-complete-list-of-netflix-tv-shows-and-movies-for-india/\">Netflix in India: Here&#8217;s everything you need to know</a></strong></p>\n<p>Chromecast 2 also has a better design than the original. It&#8217;s a flexible HDMI wire, connected to a circular dongle. This helps you connect the Chromecast 2 in tight spaces where the original one could not be connected, or where the original one (which looked like a large USB drive) would block adjoining ports.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-2778718 size-full\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/chromecast2_big_4.jpg\" alt=\"Chromecast 2, Google Chromecast 2, Chromecast 2 buy, Chromecast 2 vs Chromecast 1, Chromecast 2 price, Chromecast 2 features, Chromecast 2 specs, Chromecast 2 streaming apps, Chromecast 2 Netflix, Netflix on Chromecast, technology, technology news\" /> Chromecast 2 also has a better design than the original. It&#8217;s a flexible HDMI wire, connected to a circular dongle.\n<p><strong>Do I need to upgrade my old Chromecast?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have an original Chromecast and it&#8217;s working perfectly well, there isn&#8217;t a compelling reason to upgrade. The 5GHz frequency is the biggest improvement in the new one, and that is not so convincing for an upgrade\u00a0unless you have:</p>\n<p>1) A Wi-Fi ac router<br />\n2) A smartphone or tablet that supports Wi-Fi ac and 5GHz frequency<br />\n3) A need to play Android games on the big screen</p>\n<p>For most people, these aren&#8217;t good enough reasons to buy the new Chromecast. Judge for yourself if you fit into this.</p>\n<p><strong>The best Chromecast apps for India</strong></p>\n<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking.

Flights disappeared from radar screens, causing a blackout. The problem was traced to disturbances in the Earth\u2019s magnetic field near the area.</p>\n<p>These disturbances in the magnetic field were caused by what are known as solar flares, a sudden burst of highly energetic electromagnetic radiation from the surface of the Sun. The energy accompanying the most energetic of these solar flares is equivalent to that contained in billions of hydrogen bombs.</p>\n<p>These electromagnetic bursts often interfere with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and can result in different kinds of impacts. On March 13, 1989, for example, the hydroelectric transmission system in Quebec, Canada, suffered an outage for eight-nine hours, and it was once again found to be triggered by solar flares.</p>\n<p>Because of the kind of havoc it can cause on Earth, it is important for us to guard ourselves and our vital installations from solar flares in future. Efforts are being made to understand the processes that trigger a solar flare, so that these can be predicted and a warning can be issued.</p>\n<p>But right now, we are several steps away from that objective. What we do know is that most of the solar flares originate from \u2018sunspot\u2019 regions on the surface of the Sun. Some of these sunspots are bigger in area than the Earth, a few even equal to Jupiter in area, but show up as tiny regions on the Sun\u2019s surface. These sunspots are highly magnetised regions and are cooler than surrounding areas of the Sun. The solar flares are observed to originate right above these regions. The magnetic forces over sunspots are so stressed that beyond a threshold they get released in a blast of energy.</p>\n<p>The phenomenon is similar, in a way, to earthquakes which also happen when mechanical stress, as a result of movement of landmass below the surface, becomes unbearable to store.</p>\n<p>There is a certain kind of sunspot, called \u2018delta\u2019 sunspot, that accounts for almost 95 per cent of all X-ray radiation reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. In the delta sunspots, the magnetic poles, north and south, lie very close to each other, because of which the magnetic forces are exceedingly stressed. These sunspots continue to release energy through multiple solar flares.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/from-the-lab-solar-flares-taking-the-heat-off/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/nasa-to-launch-two-sounding-rockets-to-study-earths-magnetic-field/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/11/caper-testing_480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">NASA to launch two sounding rockets to study Earth&#039;s magnetic field</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/strong-solar-storm-heading-to-earth-say-scientists/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/09/solar-thumb.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Strong solar storm heading to Earth, say scientists</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/discovered-suns-magnetic-heartbeat/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/04/m_id_373704_sun.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Discovered: Sun&#039;s magnetic &#039;heartbeat&#039;</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/heres-to-a-weak-sunspot-cycle/\"><span class=\"text\">Here\u0092s to a weak sunspot cycle</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/predicting-weather-in-our-stars/\"><span class=\"text\">Predicting weather in our stars</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/radiation-risk-from-flying-trumps-body-scanners/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2010/11/m_id_187563_flight.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Radiation risk from flying trumps body scanners</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>For a few years now, we have been trying to recreate the solar flare conditions through our computer simulation models. None of the existing computer simulations has come close to reproducing the amount of energy released during a typical solar flare. Our new simulation is a significant improvement over the existing ones and generates a very promising picture of a solar flare.</p>\n<p>Our physical equations take into account the effect caused by the rotation of the Sun, something that the existing simulations never did. Like the Earth, and many other heavenly bodies, the Sun also rotates around its axis, and it goes around once in 27 days. This rotation twists the magnetic fields inside the Sun\u2019s surface, leading to further magnetic stress.</p>\n<p>We believe our computer simulation model is a big step forward in understanding solar flares, but a lot of work still needs to be done. The next step is to test the model with actual solar observations from the past, to test whether it can recreate solar flares that have already occurred. If we are able to manage that successfully, we can start working on a prediction model for solar flares.</p>\n<p>These results of our simulation model were published in the Physical Review Letters journal under the title, \u2018Modeling Repeatedly Flaring Delta Sunspots\u2019.</p>\n<p>For your research to be considered for this column, please write to Senior Editor Amitabh Sinha at amitabh.sinha@expressindia.com</p>\n<p><em>By: Piyali Chatterjee, IIAP, Bangalore;

&#8211; swirling patterns of light and dark found at over a hundred locations across the lunar surface.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These patterns, called &#8216;lunar swirls,&#8217; appear almost painted on the surface of the Moon,&#8221; said John Keller of NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Centre in US.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They are unique; we&#8217;ve only seen these features on the Moon, and their origin has remained a mystery since their discovery,&#8221;

Perhaps the magnetic field shields the surface from weathering by the solar wind.</p>\n<p>In the new research, scientists created computer models that provide new insights into how the magnetic shield hypothesis could work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem with the magnetic shield idea is that the embedded magnetic fields on the Moon are very weak \u2013 about 300 times weaker than Earth&#8217;s magnetic field,&#8221; said Bill Farrell of NASA Goddard.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to see how they would have the strength to deflect the solar wind ions,&#8221; Farrell said.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>The new models show that the magnetic field can create a strong electric field when the solar wind attempts to flow through.</p>\n<p>It is this brawny electric potential of many hundreds of Volts that could deflect and slow particles in the solar wind.</p>\n<p>This would reduce the weathering from the solar wind, leaving brighter regions over protected areas.</p>\n<p>New observations from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission, provide support for the magnetic shield hypothesis, but do not rule out the other ideas.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778107&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/nasa-moon-mysterious-tattoos-2778107/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/nasa-moon-tattoos-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/nasa-moon-tattoos-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Nasa-moon-tattoos-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/nasa-moon-tattoos-big.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">NASA, Apollo program, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Nasa space program, Moon tattoos, Lunar swirls, space news, science news</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Noble 48-inch Android-powered smart TV  exclusively on Amazon at Rs 39,999</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/noble-android-smart-tv-launch-amazon-exclusive-2778015/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/noble-android-smart-tv-launch-amazon-exclusive-2778015/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2016 18:29:38 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2016 18:30:16 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Gadgets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2778015</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Noble 48-inch smart TV supports WiFi and comes with HDMI, USB and VGA port for connectivity<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778015&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/noble-android-tv-main.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2778098\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/noble-android-tv-main.jpg\" alt=\"Noble's 48-inch smart TV is powered by Android and supports Miracast for connecting mobiles and tablets\" /></a> Noble&#8217;s 48-inch smart TV is powered by Android and supports Miracast for connecting mobiles and tablets\n<p>Noble has launched\u00a0its latest 48-inch Android powered smart TV in India.

It&#8217;s been a &#8220;bummer,&#8221; he says, because he passed up buying a rival headset, the HTC Vive, hoping to be part of a VR &#8220;renaissance&#8221; with Rift.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been kind of like an Oculus believer,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But if they bump it again, I might just order a Vive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s too soon to say how the delays will affect Oculus, much less the overall acceptance of VR, a technology that submerges users in realistic artificial worlds. (Early VR &#8220;experiences&#8221; consist primarily of video games.) In other contexts, big companies like Apple have managed to weather shortages and shipping delays for products such as the Apple Watch and its new iPhone SE.</p>\n<p>But some find the Rift delays intolerable, especially given that Oculus is no fledgling startup, but part of <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/facebook/\">Facebook</a> &#8211; the social network bought it two years ago for $2 billion. &#8220;There&#8217;s an element of inexcusable incompetence going on,&#8221; says J.P. Gownder, a Forrester Research analyst, who placed his preorder in the first 10 minutes but doesn&#8217;t expect his Rift until mid-May.</p>\n<p>Experienced hardware manufacturers would have set up suppliers months or years in advance to avoid these types of problems, Gownder says. The fact that Oculus managed to bungle its launch with more than three years to prepare, plus the backing of Facebook, is &#8220;scandalous,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9xLiQS3hIpf0nqcF1OBdWxH\" target=\"_blank\">Watch all our video reviews</a> </strong></p>\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]\n<p>Oculus, which has blamed the delays on an &#8220;unexpected component shortage,&#8221; declined to comment on specifics. It told the AP in a statement it has moved to address the shortage and expects deliveries to accelerate in coming weeks. By way of apology, Oculus said it will offer free shipping to customers who ordered before April 1.</p>\n<p>Few have been as disappointed as some of the company&#8217;s earliest supporters. Back in January, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey announced that 5,600 of the company&#8217;s first Kickstarter backers would be eligible for a free headset. He then tweeted on the eve of first deliveries that the gifts would &#8220;start arriving&#8221; two days before others, giving the impression Kickstarter backers would get theirs first.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t happen. Unhappy customers gathered on Reddit to complain and to figure out where they stood in line; one poster catalogued the frustration on a crowdsourced spreadsheet. While not necessarily representative of the entire Oculus customer base, that data shows that of the 131 early Kickstarter backers who submitted responses, only 28 report receiving a unit. Of 1,399 pre-order customers, just 165 say they got a Rift.</p>\n<p>The virtual reality boom is just getting going, and the competition is growing. Sony will release its PlayStation VR headset later this year. <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> is expected to expand on its primitive Cardboard viewer, and recent Apple acquisitions suggest that it may also be jumping into the field soon.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Rift is losing some of its first-mover appeal. Some games originally designed to be Oculus exclusives have now been hacked to work on the HTC Vive, which launched about a week after the Rift, but hasn&#8217;t experienced shipping delays. Customers who bought Rift games before receiving their headset can now get digital keys so they can play the games in real reality, on a regular PC.</p>\n<p>Bill Ellis, a 30-year-old computer engineer in Houston, has been playing with his Vive since it arrived April 5, and may not keep the Rift after it arrives. His plan, he says, was always to buy both, and sell the one that didn&#8217;t live up to expectations: &#8220;The one that hasn&#8217;t shown up is the one that hasn&#8217;t lived up to my expectations so far.&#8221;</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777523&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/oculus-rift-virtual-reality-headset-dealy-2777523/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/oculus-feat.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/oculus-feat.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Oculus-feat</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6197f6fa94e2acf9b9c428313e902bdd?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">karthekayaniyer</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/oculus-main.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Oculus&#039; longtime supporters have declared themselves alienated by the company&#039;s inability to deliver (Source: AP)</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Twitter switches from social network to news on the App Store</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/twitter-news-apple-app-store-2777469/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/twitter-news-apple-app-store-2777469/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2016 11:18:43 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2016 12:33:41 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2777469</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Twitter is no longer pitted against Facebook and is now categorised under the news section in the App Store.<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777469&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/twitter-7592.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2777478\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/twitter-7592.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter is no longer pitted against Facebook and is now categorised under the news section in the App Store.\" /></a> Twitter is no longer pitted against <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/facebook/\">Facebook</a> and is now categorised under the news section in the App Store.\n<p>After reporting dismal results this week, micro-blogging website Twitter is no longer pitted against social networks like Facebook and is now categorised under the &#8220;news&#8221; section in the Apple&#8217;s App Store.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Starting today (Friday), Twitter is categorised under the &#8216;news&#8217; section of the App Store rather than &#8216;social networking&#8217;.

Most comets are made of ice and other frozen compounds and were formed in solar system&#8217;s frigid far reaches.</p>\n<p>Researchers believe the newly found comet was formed in the same region as Earth, then booted to the solar system&#8217;s backyard like a gravitational slingshot as planets jostled for position.</p>\n<p>Scientists involved in the discovery now seek to learn how many more Manx comets exist, which could help to resolve debate over exactly how and when the solar system settled into its current configuration.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/astronomers-find-a-tailless-comet-first-of-its-kind-2777312/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/more-audacious-than-rosetta/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/11/rosetta_t.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">More audacious than Rosetta</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/philae-lander-plants-thermometer-on-comet/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/11/philae-thumb.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Philae lander plants thermometer on comet</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/he-is-26-and-only-india-link-to-historic-landing/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/11/sjsgsgs.jpg?w=209?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Rosetta mission: He is 26, and only India link to historic landing</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/skywatchers-gear-up-for-rare-celestial-event/\"><span class=\"text\">Sky-watchers gear up for rare celestial event</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/mysterious-centaurs-may-be-comets-nasa/\"><span class=\"text\">Mysterious centaurs may be comets: NASA</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/comet-of-the-century/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/02/m_id_359618_ison_comet.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Comet of the Century?</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>&#8220;Depending how many we find, we will know whether the giant planets danced across the solar system when they were young, or if they grew up quietly without moving much,&#8221; paper co-author Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer with the European Southern Observatory in Germany, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The new comet, known as C/2014 S3, was discovered in 2014 by the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, or Pan-STARRS.

Ashish Hemrajani, co founder of BookMyShow, revealed the company&#8217;s plans at Connect 2016, a global app developers conference organised by Cheetah Mobile in Beijing.</p>\n<p>Speaking to IndianExpress.com, Ashish said users will be allowed to book tickets and pay back the amount within 30 days. The number of tickets a user can purchase will be capped and they won&#8217;t be allowed to buy more without clearing their outstanding amount. According to Ashish, BookMyshow has set a timeline of 30-60 days to roll out the option. It will be first tested in one of the states before expanding the service across the country.</p>\n<p>Asked why a user would prefer to delay paying an amount as small as Rs 200 for a film ticket, Ashish said that most Indians are reluctant to pay through cards. &#8220;My car driver earns a decent income, but he doesn&#8217;t have a credit card. Our option would allow him to purchase tickets and payback within 30 days at any of the theaters,&#8221; said Ashish.</p>\n<div class=\"holder-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"likefb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Share This Article</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"but-share\"><a target='_blank' href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/book-my-show-tickets-credit-online-2776320/'><img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/indianexpress/images/fbshare.jpg' width=\"116\" height=\"42\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"cara-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"names\">Related Article</div><ul class=\"rel-article\"><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/interview-bookmyshows-anish-tripathi-design-revamp-tech-2791972/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/bookmyshow_feat.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Interview: BookMyShow\u2019s Anish Tripathi explains why design matters in tech</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/now-book-tickets-on-irctc-directly-via-mobikwik-wallet/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/mobikwik-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Now book tickets on IRCTC directly via MobiKwik wallet</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/saavn-partners-with-paytm/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/09/saavn-logo-480.jpg?w=450?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Saavn Pro users can now pay using Paytm mobile wallet on Android</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/ticketing-process-of-indian-f1-gp-to-be-a-hassle-free-affair/\"><span class=\"text\">Ticketing process of Indian F1 GP to be a hassle free affair</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/tendulkar-drives-online-ipl-ticket-sales/\"><span class=\"text\">Tendulkar drives online IPL ticket sales</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/bookmyshow-com-offers-movies-for-just-re-1/\"><img src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2010/08/m_id_166467_bookmyshow.jpg?w=300?w=65\"> <span class=\"text\">Bookmyshow.com offers movies for just Re 1</span></a></li></ul></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjQuery('.rel-article').bxSlider({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaxSlides: 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tslideMargin: 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The portal is currently building its own algorithm to analyse the &#8220;trust worthiness&#8221; of the user before extending them credit.

The option to payback later would certainly be a hit among college students who might be short on cash towards the end of the month.</p>\n<p>This move could help BookMyShow increase its number of transactions in India where only 20 million of its population have credits cards. Currently 70% of BookMyShow transactions are on mobile and they claim to have 9 million mobile active users.</p>\n<p>BookMyShow has been on the lookout to expand their reach, especially in the sports segment, and has recently acquired Chennai-based startup Fantain to get an idea of fan insights and engagement.

With a 7 per cent market share, Lyf also became the second largest LTE vendor in India ahead of Micromax and Lenovo.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn first quarter of its inception, LYF instantly climbed to become one of the top five smartphone brands in India in terms of shipment volumes. Jio with its massive LTE network and scale could be the key player to watch out for as it has already become the second largest LTE phone supplier during the quarter,\u201d said Tarun Pathak, Senior Analyst at Counterpoint.</p>\n<p>The firm said these strong shipments were more of \u201cchannel filling\u201d and the actual sell-through will happen in Q2 2016 as the operator starts full-fledged marketing and promotional activity.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2776812\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/counterpoint-q1-2016.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"samsung, apple, Reliance Lyf, Micromax, Counterpoint\" width=\"600\" height=\"457\" /></p>\n<p>Samsung was again on top in both smartphones and overall handsets powered by the good performance of its flagship Galaxy S7/S7 Edge and popular J series. Apple recorded 62% annual growth in the first quarter despite of negative growth results globally for iPhones.</p>\n<p>However, the big success story was the Chinese brands which recorded significant year-over-year growth numbers. Vivo was up +759 per cent, OPPO +183 per cent and <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/tag/xiaomi/\">Xiaomi</a> +35 per cent as the Chinese brands captured 21 per cent share of total smartphone shipments in Q1 2016, says the report.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Indian smartphone market demand was healthy, as we saw newer brands enter with attractive offerings and aggressive pricing throughout the quarter. The demand for LTE smartphones remained strong as two out of three smartphone shipped was LTE capable.

he said.</p>\n<p>While sales for Apple in China, its second-largest market after the United States, fell 11 per cent, in India iPhone sales were up 56 per cent from a year ago.</p>\n<p>Cook said Apple is placing increasing emphasis in such emerging markets where it&#8217;s clear there will be disproportionate growth as compared to the more developed areas.</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back perhaps but some others as well is that the LTE rollout with India just really began this year, and so we&#8217;ll begin to see some really good networks coming on in India,&#8221;

According to Chinese state media, China spends about $2 billion a year on its space programme, though details are vague.</p>\n<p>China said this month that it would launch a &#8220;core module&#8221; for its first space station sometime around 2018, part of a plan to have a permanent manned space station in service around 2022.</p>\n<p>China is also preparing to launch a Mars probe in 2020, which would reach the planet in 2021, the official Xinhua news agency has said.</p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2775954&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/china-aims-for-manned-moon-landing-by-2036-2775954/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/christmas2015fullmoon-small.jpg?w=450\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/christmas2015fullmoon-small.jpg?w=450\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">christmas2015fullmoon-small</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0819661da57ab215d27a08889e5df6cb?s=96&#38;d=identicon&#38;r=G\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">rajashreeindianexpress</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://indianexpressonline.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/moon759.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">moon759</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>China&#8217;s Baidu plans to produce driverless car by 2020</title>\n\t\t<link>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/baidu-china-driverless-cars-production-2020-2775914/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/baidu-china-driverless-cars-production-2020-2775914/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2016 12:33:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2016 12:33:55 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://indianexpress.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=2775914</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Baidu is intent on bringing self driving vehicles to market, to produce driverless cars by 2020<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2775914&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />]]></description>\n\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/baidu-china-main.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2775924\" src=\"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/baidu-china-main.jpg\" alt=\"Baidu is intent on bringing self driving vehicles to market, to produce driverless cars by 2020\" /></a> Baidu is intent on bringing self driving vehicles to market, to produce driverless cars by 2020\n<p>Chinese search engine giant Baidu is planning to produce driverless cars by 2020, its chief executive said, as the company reported revenue climbed sharply in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>Income for the three months ending in March reached USD 2.45 billion (15.82 billion yuan), up 31.2 per cent from the same period a year earlier, according to a statement released Thursday, as ads flowed into its search engine.</p>\n<div class=\"related\"><h4>Read More</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/baidu-china-driverless-cars-production-2020-2775914/\">China&#039;s Baidu plans to produce driverless car by 2020</a></li><li><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/google-building-self-driving-cars-with-no-driver-seat-steering-wheels/\">Google building self-driving cars with no driver seat, steering wheels</a></li></ul></div><p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a terrific start to 2016,&#8221;
